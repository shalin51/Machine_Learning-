how much do you think private security contractors like blackwater charge private companies greetings i am doing a report on private security companies like blackwater dyncorp etc i am wondering if anyone knew an estimate of how much these companies charge for corporate business security in places like the middle east for example if a medium sized trading company wanted to open a center in a risky country what do you think the industry charge would be this is a difficult question to answer unless you define the requirements better the cost of security personnel in iraq would probably range from to per hour per person there would also be costs for logistics housing equipment supervision and management etc and the customer would typically pay for all of these costs in addition to the hourly rate for personnel so if you had ten security people on staff it could cost you about million just for security personnel alone a company that was serious about doing this would typically hire a security consultant to do a threat assessment based on the size and location of the proposed trading company the consultant would then recommend the number of security personnel needed types of security systems etc and the client could budget accordingly  Private military contractor Wal-Mart Call centre Insurance Citigroup United Kingdom corporation tax Donald Rumsfeld Blackwater USA Defense Logistics Agency United States Postal Service Reliability engineering Management Credit card Trade union Raytheon Halliburton British national identity card National Health Service Education in the People's Republic of China Karl Rove Privatization Bank Sarbanes-Oxley Act Outsourcing Investment bank Hanscom Air Force Base Telephone numbering plan Classified information Japan Self-Defense Forces Mutual fund Microsoft America Online Corporate governance MMORPG Manitoba Hydro Voice over IP Non-governmental organization Peacekeeping Plame affair Taxation in the United States Social Security (United States) Publicly funded medicine Corporate finance Health insurance Multinational force in Iraq Coalition Provisional Authority Capital accumulation Xerox Incident Command System Microeconomics Tax Risk management Gartner United Airlines United States Marine Corps Unemployment United Nations Oil-for-Food Programme Security (finance) Social Security debate (United States) Natural monopoly Enterprise resource planning Secretar__a de Inteligencia Security guard Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina New Deal Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Hedge fund Casualties of the conflict in Iraq since 2003 Crew Exploration Vehicle Government of France Information Services Procurement Library Financial analyst George W.

what is the definition of options attached to bonds in the context of corporate bonds a bond is a debt investment in which an investor loans money to a company that borrows the funds for a defined period of time at a fixed interest rate bonds are used by companies to finance a variety of projects and activities bonds are commonly referred to as fixed income securities and are one of the three main asset classes along with stocks and cash equivalents the indebted entity issuer issues a bond that states the interest rate coupon that will be paid and when the loaned funds bond principal are to be returned maturity date interest on bonds is usually paid every six months semi annually so if the coupon is and the bond has a maturity period of yrs the bond investor will receive interest at p a every six months until the end of the yrs when he will get his principal back a slightly more complicated type of bond is the convertible bond convertibles one that comes with an option for it to be converted into a predetermined amount of the company's equity at certain times during its life usually at the discretion of the bondholder convertibles are sometimes called cvs issuing convertible bonds is one way for a company to minimize negative investor interpretation of its corporate actions for example if an already public company chooses to issue stock the market usually interprets this as a sign that the company's share price is somewhat overvalued to avoid this negative impression the company may choose to issue convertible bonds which bondholders will likely convert to equity anyway should the company continue to do well from the investor's perspective a convertible bond has a value added component built into it it is essentially a bond with a stock option hidden inside thus it tends to offer a lower rate of return in exchange for the value of the option to trade the bond into stock obviously if the bondholder exercises his option and converts the bond into stock he becomes a stockholder of the co and he doesn't get the bond principal returned to him of course he can choose not to exercise his option in which case he will have the principal returned to him  Finance Arbitrage Mortgage Annuity Stock market Collateralized debt obligation Treasury security Income trust Corporate finance Rational pricing Cost of capital Investment bank Mortgage-backed security Credit derivative Life insurance Corporation Economy of Russia United Kingdom corporation tax Convertible bond PE ratio Option Yield curve Option style Government debt Futures contract Financial markets Insurance Islamic banking Government National Mortgage Association Hedge fund Mergers and acquisitions Margin (finance) Monetary policy Zero coupon bond Derivative (finance) Bank Capital asset pricing model Financial services Bretton Woods system Capital accumulation Temasek Holdings Enron Corporation Gold standard Modern portfolio theory Dividend Credit card Black-Scholes Variable universal life insurance Citigroup Money supply Deflation (economics) High-yield debt Venture capital Lehman Brothers Collateralized mortgage obligation Closed-end fund Individual Savings Account Money Floating rate note Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Hyperinflation Gross domestic product Social Security debate (United States) Taxation in the United States Microeconomics Securitization Institutional fund management The South Sea Company Asian financial crisis Personal finance Trust (Law) USA 401(k) Privatization Social Security (United States) FairTax Capitalism Eugene Fama Stock exchange Call option Employee stock option Federal Reserve Donald Trump Bank fraud Inflation Dot-com Debt levels and flows Gilts

amazon com who knows where to get free amazon com gift cards certificates those free amazon gift card are really just a big pyramid scam i got this from scambusters let's get going with today's article can you really get free designer handbags and other valuable prizes let's begin with a story we recently spoke to a friend we'll call emily who complained about how many times she'd received an email promising a free designer handbag worth hundreds of dollars but she had always passed up the offer emily said she thought it sounded too good to be true after all she asked who wouldn't want a handbag from designers like fendi gucci marc jacobs and coach free we advised emily not to do what she wound up doing but against our strong advice and her better judgment emily decided to see what would happen if she followed through emily said she'd report her results so that if it was a scam like we predicted at least our subscribers could benefit from her mistake please don't try this at home you'll see why as we share her story just because they say it's free doesn't mean it is here's what happened emily visited the link in the email and was brought to a website where she was offered the choice of a fendi bag a marc jacobs bag a gucci bag or a coach bag the values of these bags ranged from seven hundred dollars to seventeen hundred dollars the website asked emily to select the bag she wanted and to provide them with her email address she thought doesn't sound like too much to ask for considering the reward being offered right she thought that if her email address really was the only thing they wanted from her it may have indeed been a good deal however emily dug a bit further and found out what that bag would really cost her get ready for spam just for the fun of it emily thought she'd check out the website's privacy policy before actually giving them her email address or any other information it's a good thing she did it seems that the companies that offer these types of promotions don't keep your information confidential in fact the privacy policy states outright they'll share your information with third parties to translate this into layman's terms it means your information will be available for sale to almost any party wishing to purchase it if you do provide your email address to one of these websites get ready for a boatload of spaham in your inbox and if you think opting out of the mailing list will save you frustration you're wrong the privacy policy of this site also stated that while opting out will discontinue emails from the actual website it won't discontinue emails from the companies who bought your information from the site fortunately emily followed our advice from previous issues of scambusters here she used a throw away email address and that is exactly what she had to do with that email address but there's more if you think a designer bag is worth selling your information to strangers especially using a throw away email address there's a lot more you need to know about these offers to actually get the prize you're being promised you have to complete a survey the survey asks for your name address and phone number and then bombards you with dozens of online offers and asks you to check a box indicating whether or not you're interested in each offer displayed emily said that getting through the twenty minute bombardment of offers was bad enough then she found out that she had to complete a total of ten separate offers to qualify for the bag accepting these offers would involve getting phone calls or paying money it was becoming clear that this bag was not going to be free at all take it a step further let's assume you didn't mind your inbox being spahammed or your information being sold and there were actually ten offers you wanted to accept you'd get your bag right wrong not only do you have to complete ten offers you have to refer five people from separate households to the site and all five of those people also have to accept ten offers now let's say each of the five people you refer actually complete ten offers then you get your bag right no not yet those five people each have to refer five more people then you qualify for the bag what are the chances of that happening probably almost none so who's getting the prize these not so free offer sites don't always offer free designer handbags some offer gift certificates to stores others offer gift certificates to restaurants some offer laptop computers and others offer video game systems the prizes change but the end result remains the same when most people visit one of these sites they enter their information accept a few offers and then realize there is no possible way they are going to actually get the prize at that point they exit the site the companies that run these websites count on people leaving the site in the middle of the process that way they don't have to give you the prize the company now has your personal information and will sell it to third parties for a profit the company has also profited from the few offers you did complete a waste of time at best here's emily's conclusion the website owner now has a bundle of cash at your expense and you have absolutely nothing in fact you've just wasted a bunch of your time the average person spends at least twenty minutes at one of these sites before they realize the direction in which things are going and that they will never get the prize one more thing some of these sites are even worse than we just described even if you miraculously managed to jump over all the hurdles to get your prize you still wouldn't receive it since some of these sites are outright scams and there is no way to know beforehand so do yourself a favor avoid spaham and websites that offer free designer handbags or other valuable prizes and no emily never got her free designer handbag hope this help  Microeconomics Surveillance RuneScape cheats Make money fast

what do you do if you know of someone doing kickbacks referring to my previous question thing is i care about the person and yet don't like knowing they are doing this and keeping it a secret being an honest person just makes it hard but i feel i need to do the right thing just don't want them knowing that i know please obtain good legal advice before you report the person who is soliciting and or receiving kickbacks the reason you need such advice is to prevent exposing yourself to a lawsuit for libel or the like obviously if you report the person to his employer the person will be fired immediately that person may try to sue the employer and others you for unlawful termination therefore consult a good attorney to review your suspicions your evidence your motives and other facts then your attorney can explain your options beginning with do nothing and make informed recommendations good luck  Slander and libel Expert system Karl Rove Oil-for-Food Programme Contract Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines USA PATRIOT Act Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Political corruption Probation officer Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution 9/11 conspiracy theories Appeal Jean Charles de Menezes Supreme Court of the United States Infantilism Guantanamo Bay Ethics Prior restraint Patent Scientology beliefs and practices Downing Street memo Combatant Status Review Tribunal Nuclear option (filibuster) Unlawful combatant Lawsuit 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Identity theft Theory of conduct Ronnie Earle Asbestos Fred A.

what are kickbacks in a true kickback arrangement a seller kicks back some of the sales proceeds to the buying company's agent the buyer's agent demands and or accepts the money as a condition for steering the deal to the seller and of course the buying company doesn't know that its own employee or agent is getting this money kickbacks are akin to but not exactly the same as bribes finder's fees and commissions in many most countries of the world kickbacks are routine expected and legal even if not quite ethical in such countries sellers know that they will make no sales unless a portion of the price is kicked back to the buyer's agent and buyer companies know that their employees and agents are soliciting and accepting kickbacks some kickback arrangements are illegal in some countries of the world in the u s three types of kickbacks are illegal in almost all circumstances it is illegal for a publicly traded company to pay kickbacks that are deducted for u s tax purposes in practical effect this means that publicly traded companies cannot legally pay kickbacks in foreign countries even if kickbacks are legal and necessary in those foreign countries it is illegal for an employer to accept kickbacks from employees although it is illegal it is an unfortunate fact that many employees are forced to pay kickbacks to their bosses just to get and keep a job in the u s it is illegal for any public official to solicit or accept kickbacks and or bribes most people are surprised to learn that even in the u s most kickback arrangements are not illegal even if they are immoral unethical civilly wrongful and tortious etc in other words if a buyer's employee or agent gets caught accepting kickbacks the person will be fired and probably sued for damages but the person won't face jail because it's usually not a crime except for the big named above hope this helps  Contract Political corruption Oil-for-Food Programme Microeconomics Capitalism Insurance Stock Illegal drug trade Tax Wal-Mart Economics Internet fraud Plame affair Supply and demand Business ethics Enron Corporation Health insurance Real estate broker Arbitrage Usury Surplus value Arguments for and against drug prohibition Auction Coercion Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ethical consumerism Black market Ethics Tort Islamic banking Mortgage Security (finance) Price discrimination Copyright infringement of software Financial markets Poker jargon Bulk vending FairTax Short selling Capital accumulation Gold standard United Kingdom corporation tax Life insurance Mutual fund Corporation Trust (Law) USA Monetary policy Schabir Shaik Trial Marriage ITunes Music Store GNU General Public License Monopoly Child pornography Reparations for slavery Fair Game (Scientology) Gross domestic product Economy of Russia 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Privatization Karl Rove Inventory Education in the People's Republic of China Advertising Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Monopsony Derivative (finance) Option Babylonian law Corruption scandals in the Paris region Bribery Warranty Gold as an investment Conflict of interest Trade union Copyright Publishing Jonathan Wild Consensual crime Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia Apple Computer Public domain Taxation in the United States Bond Laws of Singapore SCO-Linux controversies Scientology beliefs and practices Dot-com History of the British constitution Labor theory of value Investment bank Dividend Food and Drug Administration Illegal immigration EastEnders

which inventory system provides the more effective means of controlling inventories perpetual or periodic why definitely the perpetual inventory system under the periodic inventory system there is no way to tell from the general ledger accounts the amount of inventory on hand or the cost of goods sold until the end of the year whereas under the perpetual inventory system the inventory account and the cogs a c are continuously updated so management can always tell the monthly profit and inventory on hand a periodic inventory system under this system the amount appearing in the inventory account is not updated when purchases of merchandise are made from suppliers rather the inventory account is commonly updated or adjusted only once at the end of the year during the year the inventory account will likely show only the cost of inventory at the end of the previous year under the periodic inventory system purchases of merchandise are recorded in one or more purchases accounts at the end of the year the purchases account s are closed and the inventory account is adjusted to equal the cost of the merchandise actually on hand at the end of the year under the periodic system there is no cost of goods sold account to be updated when a sale of merchandise occurs in short under the periodic inventory system there is no way to tell from the general ledger accounts the amount of inventory or the cost of goods sold b perpetual inventory system under this system the inventory account is continuously updated the inventory account is increased with the cost of merchandise purchased from suppliers and it is reduced by the cost of merchandise that has been sold to customers the purchases account s do not exist under the perpetual system there is a cost of goods sold account that is debited at the time of each sale for the cost of the merchandise that was sold under the perpetual system a sale of merchandise will result in two journal entries one to record the sale and the cash or accounts receivable and one to reduce inventory and to increase cost of goods sold the attached site has a very good explanation of periodic and perpetual systems  Inventory Double-entry book-keeping Microeconomics Supply and demand Management information system Wal-Mart Inflation Financial audit Vendor Managed Inventory SAP R/3 Credit card Gross domestic product Tax Monetary policy Corporate finance Enterprise resource planning Insurance Real estate economics Nintendo Entertainment System Economy of Russia Accounting methods Annuity Sears Holdings Corporation Personal finance Mergers and acquisitions Law of value Costco United Kingdom corporation tax Revco Capitalism FairTax Credit card fraud Throughput accounting Income statement Electronic commerce Intellectual property Value added tax Life insurance Product (business) Bank Surplus value Privatization Bond Corporate governance Point of sale Mortgage Asset Monopoly Gold standard Deflation (economics) Say's law Black market Tesco Day trading Price discrimination PE ratio Short selling Sales force management system American Motors Keynesian economics Money Illegal drug trade Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Cost accounting Measures of national income and output Variable universal life insurance Leasing Commodore International Depreciation First-sale doctrine Industrial engineering Neopets The Long Tail Social Security (United States) Prohibition Space Shuttle program Subscription business model EFTPOS Prices of production Daylight saving time Bulk vending Commodity Best Buy Nuclear power Corporation Management Hash table BAE Systems Ford Motor Company

how do you get your company to go scent free it seems that there are several employees including managers who seem to think more is better when it comes to colognes perfumes you really can't force this you could ask hr or management to send a memo reminding people that some are more sensitive to scent than others and to go easy on it i doubt you could eliminate it i used to work with a lady who claimed that the slightest scent gave her migraines she wanted everyone in the office to switch to unscented soap shampoo lotion laundry detergent etc we told her that was absolutely unreasonable we would watch it on the perfume levels but we were not all switching to unscented ivory soap for her convenience the offending parties at your workplace may not realize they are wearing so much perfume or they may have body odor issues related to a health problem that they are trying to mask so tread carefully here if you are comfortable approaching these individuals you could say something like i really like your perfume but i'm very sensitive to strong scents would you mind wearing a little less of it keep it polite and confidential you aren't going to win the fight to go completely scent free but a reduction in scent levels might be achievable if this would be uncomfortable for you get hr involved to handle this a guy i used to work with several years ago was a manager of a big retail store he had a teenager working for him who had not yet learned about deodorant she did not realize she had a body odor problem or that the rest of the staff was grossed out by it the manager finally had to pull her aside for a candid conversation about hygiene she was a little embarrassed but glad that he had pointed out the problem while this is a little different from drenching yourself in perfume it illustrates that scent is a personal issue and must be handled delicately and tactfully  Perfume Multiple chemical sensitivity Surveillance Scientology beliefs and practices Sento Breastfeeding Plame affair Japanese toilet Procter & Gamble Fecal incontinence Dog Odor Strategic management Shampoo Sanitary towel Wood carving Milton H.

please answer the following cristin madsen has recently been transferred to the appliances division of solequin corporation shortly after taking over her new position as divisional controller she was asked to develop the division s predetermined overhead rate for the upcoming year the accuracy of the rate is of some importance since it is used throughout the year and any overapplied or underapplied overhead is closed out to cost of goods sold only at the end of the year solequin corporation uses direct labor hours in all of its divisions as the allocation base for manufacturing overhead to compute the predetermined overhead rate cristin divided her estimate of the total manufacturing overhead for the coming year by the production manager s estimate of the total direct labor hours for the coming year she took her computations to the division s general manager for approval but was quite surprised when he suggested a modification in the base her conversation with the general manager of the appliances division lance jusic went like this madsen here are my calculations for next year s predetermined overhead rate if you approve we can enter the rate into the computer on january and be up and running in the job order costing system right away this year jusic thanks for coming up with the calculations so quickly and they look just fine there is however one slight modification i would like to see your estimate of the total direct labor hours for the year is hours how about cutting that to about hours madsen i don t know if i can do that the production manager says she will need about direct labor hours to meet the sales projections for next year besides there are going to be over direct labor hours during the current year and sales are projected to be higher next year jusic cristin i know all of that i would still like to reduce the direct labor hours in the base to something like hours you probably don t know that i had an agreement with your predecessor as divisional controller to shave or so off the estimated direct labor hours every year that way we kept a reserve that usually resulted in a big boost to net income at the end of the fiscal year in december we called it our christmas bonus corporate headquarters always seemed as pleased as punch that we could pull off such a miracle at the end of the year this system has worked well for many years and i don t want to change it now required explain how shaving off the estimated direct labor hours in the base for the predetermined overhead rate usually results in a big boost in net income at the end of the fiscal year should cristin madsen go along with the general manager s request to reduce the direct labor hours in the predetermined overhead rate computation to direct labor hours you need to do your own homework it's cheating  Tax Labour economics Labor theory of value Surplus value Microsoft Inflation Redundant array of independent disks Taxation in the United States Airline Economic inequality Economy of Russia Space Shuttle program Economy of India Corporate finance Social Security debate (United States) Kyoto Protocol Ford Motor Company Microeconomics Galactic Civilizations Computer Gross domestic product FairTax Economy of the United States Law of value Economics Inventory Life insurance Citigroup Extreme Programming Compiler optimization Mach kernel Capital accumulation Bretton Woods system CPU cache Outsourcing Diablo II: Lord of Destruction CPU design Air traffic control Tariff Intellectual property Economy of Nigeria ELO rating system Economy of Pakistan Anarchism and capitalism Manitoba Hydro Sears Holdings Corporation Economy of Venezuela Baseball Airbus A320 Software engineering Free trade Productive and unproductive labour Welding Social Security (United States) United Kingdom corporation tax Expert system Deflation (economics) Unemployment benefit Canadian and American economies compared Turbocharger Keynesian economics E85 Insurance X Window System Alcohol fuel Hyperinflation Progressive tax Defense Logistics Agency Economy of Colombia Monetary policy Air traffic controller Salary cap Airbus Central processing unit Domain Name System Supply and demand Digital circuit Throughput accounting Global Positioning System Indian Railways Explosive material PlayStation 3 IEEE 802.11 Hanscom Air Force Base Economy of Suriname MMORPG

if you've stopped shopping at walmart do you have a certain reason why i'd love to hear your stories i just recently stopped because of this story http www lamanaphotography com walmart htm i can't believe they refused to stop selling these after that happened just want to restate that this is not my story just one i found online on someone else's blog i stopped shopping at walmart years ago after they were fined for forcing their employees in many stores to work off the clock with the threat of being fired if they didn't do it since then there's been a gender discrimination lawsuit filed by million present and former walmart female employees since they openly paid women less than men that were doing the same exact job exact hours exact experience or more experience for many of the women and exact education it takes a tremendous amount of documentation to prove this type of case since who has access to payroll files walmart was fined in the last years for hiring illegal aliens in many of their stores including in my state nc many communities have fought against having walmart in their areas since they lower their prices initially drive out the competition then either hike their prices or close the store so the community is forced to drive to another community to another walmart also in many large cities walmart pays so poorly their employees are eligible for public assistance in housing food stamps and have poor or no medical insurance and need access to free medical care i believe california cities started noticing how much their public housing food stamp rolls increased after walmarts opened that's how walmart keeps their prices low they gouge their employees run out the competition and expect taxpayers to fill in the gaps in pay and medical coverage to their employees we're subsidizing walmart executives pay with our tax dollars that's the american way guess who is the largest employer in the us too walmart so when you hear about all those poor people who don't work that are on public rolls actually they work they just work for walmart who is using our taxes to make billions off of us  United States Postal Service Taxation in the United States Tax FairTax Health insurance Microeconomics Economic inequality George W.

is it unethical for drugs companies to charge high prices for their drugs in a way that's kind of the wrong question a corporation exists for the sole purpose of making money corporate ethics are like everything else in the corporate view based on maximizing profits in other words 'corporate ethics' is sort of an oxymoron i'm not anti capitalism i realize the profit motive is good for a lot of things but maximizing profits should not be the ultimate goal for example president clinton proposed a program whereby the fed govt would pay to vaccinate all children the idea was that the govt would buy all the vaccines from existing drug companies and make them available to everyone at no charge under the plan the drug companies would make a fair profit of course and clinton was able to show that this was a cost effective plan that vaccinating every kid would save more than it cost because kids wouldn't get sick and have to be cared for at public expense but the plan was killed by who by the drug companies why because they realized they could make more money selling the vaccines only to parents who could afford them in other words they could make more money vaccinating of american kids at the market price than vaccinating at the govt price even though the govt plan would have made them a profit and remember these drugs were developed with public money they don't actually even belong to the drug companies now of course this means that a certain number of kids would get the diseases and would cost all of us a lot of money so we are stuck paying for the care of thousands of sick kids not to mention the trauma suffered by the kids themselves and their families just so that the drug companies can maximize profits it's not really a question of 'ethics' is it it's a question of how we can best maximize the availability of drugs and health care the corporate goals of the drug companies represent a wrong priority drug company profits should be only the means to an end the end being drugs being available to people instead they are the end in itself  Ethics Microeconomics Capitalism Corporation Externality Privatization Publicly funded medicine Food and Drug Administration Health insurance Ethical consumerism Anarchism and capitalism Wal-Mart Supply and demand Theory of conduct Economics Capital accumulation Public policy Arguments for and against drug prohibition Insurance Illegal drug trade Monopoly Mutual fund Tax Inflation Life insurance Business ethics Labor theory of value United Kingdom corporation tax American individualist anarchism Arthur Laffer FairTax Stock Theodicy Criticisms of socialism Health care in the United States Pharmaceutical company Vaccine U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Price discrimination Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Management Enron Corporation Deflation (economics) Flat tax Law of value Intellectual property Economy of the United States Hillary Rodham Clinton Gross domestic product Political economy Outsourcing Surplus value Liberalism Libertarianism Corporate social responsibility Commodity Strategic management HIV vaccine Bond Precautionary principle Utilitarianism Nicomachean Ethics Medicare (Canada) Incentive Mergers and acquisitions Arbitrage Public good Medicine MMORPG Software patent debate Economy of Russia Hyperinflation Ownership MMR vaccine Growth hormone treatment Criticism of libertarianism Debt US health reform under Clinton Free trade Scientology beliefs and practices Education reform CPU design Poker jargon Monetary policy Extreme Programming Eugenics Coercion Surveillance Supply-side economics Homeopathy

what are the benefits of privately owned companies example chanel fashion house there are many many benefits to a private company over a public one you don't have to worry about the shareholders kicking you out in a public company it is federal law that the executives must give the max return to the shareholders if not they have a right to give you the boot you dont have to worry about bigger corporations who see you as a threat buying you out although there are ways to get around this you don't have to worry about corporate radiers they are ppl that belong to another company take over the rival then sell all the rivals assets to their company for really cheap then leave the company to die disadvantages in a public company you dont need alot of cash or to have a super hug income because you can always issue share to get cash but this means the big shareholders own less percent of the company you cant use the shareholders money from investing to build the company what i would do stick with a private company atleast till you're ready if you're truly ready when you go public you'll get rich when you do because your company's stock hits the roof thats wat happened to aol after it was quantum computer services and cvc control video company email me if you need to nickb estamponline net  Stock Corporation Dividend Mergers and acquisitions Mutual fund Security (finance) America Online Citigroup Wal-Mart United Kingdom corporation tax Warren Buffett Time Warner Corporate governance United Overseas Bank Capitalism Berkshire Hathaway Bond Dot-com Enron Corporation Google __lectricit__ de France Surveillance Bank Microsoft Viacom Corporate finance Sears Holdings Corporation Privatization Rupert Murdoch Stock market Asian financial crisis Deflation (economics) PE ratio Life insurance Donald Trump Cooperative Financial services Institutional fund management Annuity Finance Income trust Gross domestic product Universal Studios Capital accumulation Li Ka Shing Intellectual property Wall Street Atari Timeline of the Enron scandal Housing cooperative Boots Group Economy of Russia SCO-Linux controversies Tax American Broadcasting Company Financial markets Bank of America Bank of China (Hong Kong) Mikhail Khodorkovsky Warner Bros.

recalls on made in china products enough this week fisher price recalled about million dolls because they contained excessive amounts of lead they were made in china yes china make the products for cheap but when there is a recall involved which quite often it happens first it hurts the image of the american company lowers the consumer trust in that company and finally it costs the company more money i believe that in the upcoming years american companies are going to fed up with china imports and start making products back in the us would this be a possibility what do you think of course it isn't enough but our government is afraid to do anything because we depend on them so much not to mention the multi billion's of dollars we owe them i feel outsourcing is the way of the future unfortunately we just need more rules and better sanctions  Outsourcing Inflation Digital photography Wal-Mart FairTax Deflation (economics) Economy of Cuba Free trade Offshoring Economy of Nigeria Tax Capitalism MMORPG Asian financial crisis Capital accumulation Economy of Pakistan Economy of India Bank Hyperinflation Monetary policy Taxation in the United States Oil shale Natural monopoly Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Economy of Russia Arbitrage Microeconomics Health insurance Social Security (United States) Nuclear power U.S. public debt Insurance Hubbert peak theory Economy of the Philippines Tort reform Microsoft Gross domestic product Economy of the United States Trade Agricultural policy 2003 California recall Pharmaceutical company Energy crisis Hydrogen economy Keynesian economics Future energy development PE ratio Economy of Chile Short selling Mutual fund Economy of the People's Republic of China Economy of Romania Shrimp farm Nintendo Economy of Africa Tariff Debt Economy of Mexico Tesco Petroleum Economy of Taiwan Canadian and American economies compared Ra (board game) Food and Drug Administration United States dollar Theory of conduct Energy development Breastfeeding Opportunity cost Gold as an investment Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) High-speed rail Bond Supply and demand Japan-United States relations Economic relations of Japan Sears Holdings Corporation Space Shuttle program Economy of Trinidad and Tobago Marshall Plan United States embargo against Cuba MTR Solar cell Primerica Financial Services History of the United States (1918-1945) Law of value Oil depletion Public good Illegal drug trade Oil-for-Food Programme Dot-com Income trust Organic farming Iron Economy of Norway Protectionism Economy of Macau Social Security debate (United States) Economy of Suriname Corporation

llc vs a c corp liability concerns questions llc vs a c corp three different questions which best minimizes liability which is best reduces tax exposure which is ideal if you are going to use as an umbrella for various business engagements e g consulting practice ecommerce business real estate investment group please note that i am not asking for the definitions of each i would prefer if someone would answer the questions i've posed vs telling me to speak to a professional i can figure that out myself and intend to do so but seek input from the yahoo community to be better informed thank you well you're in luck because both an llc and a c corp can minimize your liability and your tax exposure as far as using an entity as an umbrella this is usually not a good idea you don't want unnecessary risk exposure and doing several different activities under one company can do exactly that you should keep each activity separate and sometimes that means forming multiple activities any good lawyer will tell you to keep your business activities separate because a lawsuit under one activity example consulting may put your entire company which is also engaged in real estate investing at risk keep all activities separate both an llc and a c corp if all rules and guidelines are followed correctly will shield you from your business liabilities neither will save you if you are grossly negligent or doing fraudulent activities not saying you are or will the nice aspect of an llc is that you can choose how it will be taxed under federal law an llc can be taxed as a sole proprietorship which is default if there is only one member a corporation c or s or a partnership if you are starting out as a one man show and you have potential risk exposure you may want to consider forming an llc and file your taxes as a sole proprietorship it will not give you tax savings but your personal assets will be safe from business activities if you follow the guidelines i know you hate to hear this but the rules of liability exposure the fact that it can be covered by the corporate veil tax advantages and disadvantages and everything else there is to discuss on this topic could be discussed for several hours i strongly recommend that you sit down with a lawyer and a tax professional before you start one of these entities you won't regret it yes i did read your post but i would be doing you a disservice if i did not mention that hope that helps  Corporation Insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Income trust Risk management Tort reform Corporate finance Microeconomics Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Business Annuity Incorporation (business) Plame affair Cooperative Sexual orientation Tax Capitalism Citigroup Bank Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus FairTax Corporate governance Class action Warren Buffett Microcredit Life insurance Corporate personhood Economy of the United States Personal finance Mortgage Taxation in the United States Expert system Ethical consumerism Privatization Independent Media Center Extreme Programming Trust (Law) USA Gross domestic product Security (finance) Law firm Administrative law of the United States Lloyd's of London Slander and libel Nuclear power Mutual fund Infantilism Capital accumulation Theory of conduct John Edwards Bond A Course In Miracles Ethernet Business ethics Pretty Good Privacy Lawyer Keynesian economics Liability Finance Democracy Fair use Mergers and acquisitions Asbestos 401(k) Phaedo Supply-side economics Redundant array of independent disks Welding National Kidney Foundation Singapore XML Kasparov versus The World Social Security debate (United States) Surveillance Credit card Enron Corporation Organic farming Productive and unproductive labour Marriage Digital rights management Contract Microsoft Offshore company Human sexual behavior Dave Reichert ACORN Australian constitutional law Rick Santorum Health insurance Government debt

what is audit quality what do u think i'm doing an assignment it's about words essay about audit quality your paper should mention the following the major financial reporting failures at enron and worldcom as well as apparent failures at qwest tyco adelphia and others led to the financial reporting reforms contained in the sarbanes oxley act of soa soa s reforms directly related to auditors include the establishment of the public company accounting oversight board pcaob increased audit committee responsibilities and mandatory rotation of lead and reviewing audit partners after five consecutive years on an engagement in addition regulators and the business press have shown interest in considering whether long term relationships between companies and their auditors create a level of closeness that impairs auditor independence and reduces audit quality read more at the st link the term quality audit means different things to different people for example one survey of financial statement users epstein and geiger indicated that of investors believe that audits should provide absolute assurance that there are no material misstatements or fraud in the financial statements an auditor is likely to think about audit quality in other ways in addition to strictly following gaas an auditor also assesses business risk with the intention of avoiding litigation minimizing client dissatisfaction and limiting the damage to a reputation that could follow a bad audit somewhere within this continuum is the perspective of the courts when potential audit failure cases are brought before a judge or jury no one is certain of the outcome audit quality as determined by the courts sometimes results in standards that are more specific than gaas other times less measuring audit quality is also problematic the outcome of audit quality is not directly or immediately observable audit quality control procedures attempt to maintain high standards of control over the process of an audit but an audit failure usually becomes known in the context of a business failure when a major company experiences an audit failure the business press will broadcast it it is impossible to know the number of poor quality audits that simply go undetected and unpublicized a firm may perform a poor quality audit but without knowledge of the planning and fieldwork there could be no indication of it if the financial statements are not materially misstated similarly if a poor quality audit were performed and a material misstatement overlooked there may have been no negative repercussions since audit quality is unobservable researchers look at surrogates or indicators of audit quality such as the opinions of experts to determine the inputs and outputs of a quality audit other researchers use more objective outputs as a source of determining audit quality if a firm has a low rate of litigation gets very good ratings on peer reviews and seldom has to reissue audit opinions then one can infer that it performs high quality audits nd link pcaob elements of an audit quality control system an effective audit quality control system needs to have appropriate policies and procedures related to all critical elements of quality control in thinking about what elements are critical to a registered firm's quality control the staff has developed the example of elements of an audit quality control system shown in figure following the example is a brief description of each of the elements rd link  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Trademark Principal-agent problem Scientology beliefs and practices Enron Corporation Information Technology Infrastructure Library United Kingdom corporation tax Privatization Information technology audit Institutional fund management 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Reliability engineering Microeconomics Enterprise content management Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act COBIT Plame affair Strategic management PricewaterhouseCoopers Capitalism Contract Accounting scandals Intelligent design Software testing Intellectual property Democracy Management information system Second language acquisition Appeal Insurance Divorce Cold fusion Causality Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Peer review Monetary policy Philosophy of mathematics Senate Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq Killian documents Corporation Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Hypoglycemia FairTax Cray Inc.

how do television networks and radio stations make profit i understand that through sponsorships and commercials they can turn interest from investments but how did television and radio make money when they first started i can't imagine that sponsors and commercials pay for all expenses employee wages production costs etc where is this revenue coming from if a t v show network channel or radio station receive more viewers listeners than their competitors they're deemed successful but how does this translate to revenue we as viewers and listeners only pay the electric bill when watching t v and the cable bill for more channels i'll break it down into the segments for you but the networks and stations all make their money from advertising you should note that television advertising is a multi billion dollar a year business it's much bigger than you're giving it credit for television networks the best approach is using an example for example abc wants to creat lost they pay for a pilot and make a few episodes they air the show on all abc affiliates in prime time when most viewers are watching and when advertising costs are very high since it's in prime time they normally keep all but two or three of the commercial spots that air during the hour show this is true if they own the local abc affiliate or not then they package a national advertising deal with pepsi or bud light or ford or whatever and sell it they make a boat load of money and they made even more than that when it first started today it's tougher on tv b c of the internet and cable channels etc television and radio stations make their money selling spots during the rest of the day the fox station in baltimore for example makes most of it's money selling spots during it's self produced news programming it makes it's second most money on the show that airs right after american idol is over because many people just keep it on that channel advertisers know this and they pay for that time tv stations enjoy a great margin usually in the range meaning they net cents for each of advertising they sell meanwhile grocery stores generally net cents for each of milk and bread that they sell huge difference anyway back to your second question the revenues for the national spots come from ford pepsi nike etc the revenues from the local spots come from billy bob's used cars and janey jane's mortgage company you've seen the cheesy commercials and your third question the tv shows are rated by neilsen and the radio stations by arbitron those companies provide the advertisers with how many eyeballs or ears are tuning in and that drives up the cost per spot on that station versus a station with fewer eyeballs so if fox in baltimore is airing simpsons re runs that gets more eyeballs than the abc in baltiore who's airing re runs of frasier so people spend more to get their spots on the simpsons if you look up nexstar or young or sinclair on the internet yahoo finance you can see how much money they make selling space on a frequency of the spectrum  Cable television Television syndication Fox Broadcasting Company American Broadcasting Company NFL on television ITV Major League Baseball television contracts Channel 4 Australian Broadcasting Corporation Wal-Mart CBS BBC Television commercial Public Broadcasting Service Music radio Fox News National Public Radio Soap opera Live Aid MTV Broadcasting MLB on FOX Insurance Television WNEP-TV Advertising NBC Television in Canada NASCAR WCCO Home Box Office Air America Radio Ford Motor Company Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

how much stock must you own in a co to have a say in what the company does i was having a conversation with a friend and we were curious as to what powers does a common joe schmo share holder have in regards to a company he owns stock in how much stock must he own take an estimate before he has a say or influence in what direction the company takes it totally depends it depends on the companies specific legal structure it's operational clauses and finally how it's chartered within the state or states in which it does business is incorporated in what i think you're referring to is a smaller company more than likely in which case you're only as powerful as the percentage of the total company stock that you own meaning if you own i own and there are other people that separately split the remaining you are in control from a stock holder standpoint because no one person or organized group owns more than you having that said just because you have possession of the controlling stock in a company does not mean that what you say goes you definitely have a say and would be very involved but buying stock in a company does not employ the purchaser as a company employee moreover beware of that very diversified that those other people own separately it could come to pass that they don't like your influence on the company and subsequently band together as a group rally their control in the company and oust you from power as the controlling share holder they would have a lot of paperwork to go through first because they would all have to re title their stock in the name of the organized group before the group could do anything as the controlling share holder but you would know well in advance too that there is a distention amongst the stock holders the company is notified and in some cases must approve re titling of stock in which case you technically could have time to prepare yourself for a take over situation lastly a lot of very small mom and pop corporations are truly only owned and controlled by mom and pop in this case they are not a publicly traded company so they don't have stock you can even buy if you wanted to they are not posted on the nyse new york stock exchange and for all intents and purposes are only incorporated for mom and pop's taxable advantages in these cases usually pop owns and mom owns or vice versa so there is a controlling advantage from a share holder perspective hope this help  Stock United Kingdom corporation tax Mutual fund Security (finance) Tax Sears Holdings Corporation Annuity Citigroup Stock market PE ratio Royal Dutch Shell Juris Doctor Capitalism Capital accumulation Wal-Mart 401(k) Dividend Intellectual property Bank of China (Hong Kong) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus New York Stock Exchange Time Warner Income trust Publicly funded medicine Microsoft Corporate governance Stock exchange Thai royal and noble titles Microeconomics Corporate finance Halliburton Wall Street Day trading Warren Buffett Trademark Arbitrage Plame affair Atari Option Housing cooperative Taxation in the United States United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company Tesco Short selling Treaty Economy of Iceland Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited HSBC Immigration to the United States Rupert Murdoch Article One of the United States Constitution Bumiputra Contract Cooperative Royal Assent Trade union Leasing Insider trading AMD Best Buy Viacom Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Surplus product Copyright law of the United Kingdom Poker jargon International law Mergers and acquisitions Dot-com British East India Company Sega Surplus value Trade BT Group plc News Corporation FairTax Economy of India Due process Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Conrail SCO-Linux controversies Flat tax The South Sea Company Unreformed House of Commons Municipal bond Economy of Kuwait
