irs problems my friend has issues with irs ive posted them before thing is he slacking with doing anything with it he has a deadline he needs to get certain papers to them or start paying them some of his return back about he is asking is the irs will arrest him or garnish his paycheck yes that was my question before but they thing is he didnt falsely claim his neices he just needs to proof more info which he cant his brother is his half that info is ok im thinking no one else claimed the girls but also want proof he was living there last year that he cant proof other than the borthers family and him their mom and the brothers gf mom lived there so most things are in the brothers gf moms name confusing yes lol thanxs judy yea i doubt he can find anything most important things were at a certain address th st and thats where irs info goes and lisence says which that is not the address they lived at all year they moved about times last year times being with the same landlord different home so finding two things that match is very hard if your friend lets the deadline go by without responding he is basically agreeing with whatever has been said by the irs and will most likely lose his chance to contest anything if what they said is correct anyway though that won't matter they will not likely arrest him although if fraud is suspected anything can happen but if he's supposed to be making payments and doesn't they will almost certainly garnish his wages and possibly put a lien on his assets i tried to go back and look at your earlier questions but you have your questions marked private so i couldn't ok now i see your additional info the brother being a half brother wouldn't matter that part is ok but if he can't prove that he lived there then he's out of luck he can't just claim them because nobody else does this year the irs has really cracked down on that sort of cheating does he have paystubs that show that as his address those would be in his name not the brother's gf's mom's any magazines he got delivered there any personal bills at all what did his drivers license say if he didn't really live there and was just trying to scam the system then he got caught and might as well just pay back the money and if he can't prove in any way that he lived there except by claims from relatives the irs probably won't just accept that then he's out of luck anyway  Tax protester Internet fraud Plame affair Philosophical skepticism Advance fee fraud Poker jargon Schabir Shaik Trial Killian documents Confidence trick Kent Hovind Identity theft Knots Landing Kasparov versus The World Mail fraud GED G__del's incompleteness theorem Domestic violence Transformation problem Bush v.

do illegals pay their fair share of taxes pro illegals keep making the comment that illegal immigrants pay taxes as if they are making an equal contribution i just don't understand how they can continue to confidently make this comment considering the majority of illegals are getting paid under the table sure maybe they pay sales tax but they seem to act as if paying sales tax is making an equal contribution in comparison people who pay sales and income tax obviously they're not equal real americans pay both plus a large percentage of their income is being spent in mexico and not the u s so there goes a large portion of the sales tax some do and some don't the ones who work under the table don't of course but there are plenty of legals who do that as well but many have phony ss cards and get jobs that have taxes withheld of course the government is well aware of these as the names and numbers don't match up properly but knowing that they will never file a tax return and get the refunds and credits that they would otherwise be entitled to the government quietly keeps the money this is the dirty little secret between the ssa and irs if they turned that information over to uscis rounding up a significant portion of the illegals would be child's play but they won't do this for reasons first that extra money stream would dry up and second since they work for much lower wages business would have to pay more to legal workers and that would not be business friendly never let it be said that the current administration isn't business friendly why else would bush push for guest workers and amnesty to keep business flush with cheap labor of course i've had my ssn hijacked twice so far once in the late 's and once again in the early 's talk about a pain sorting that out  Taxation in the United States FairTax Social Security (United States) Tax Progressive tax Minimum wage Flat tax H-1B visa Wal-Mart 401(k) Social Security debate (United States) Microeconomics U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Economy of the United States Gross domestic product Plame affair Economy of Russia Tax protester Capital accumulation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Publicly funded medicine Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Reaganomics Tax cut Deflation (economics) George W.
