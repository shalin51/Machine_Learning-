how do i create an online store if i dont have my own product to sell how can i sell other companies products go to shopster com for a small fee they provide a nice storefront and plug you into their pre established dropshipping partners they have a diverse selection of products the trick to success is focus on a specific category or niche of products and specialize in it do not try to make a little superstore and sell a some of everything i gaurantee you will fail there is no way you can compete with already established corporate giant superstores like amazon walmart etc electronics is highly competative but thats because these are the products being purchased online more than anything else i would stay away from it also the market is saturated focus on a specific market and advertise directly to those people fill your site with informative content create a newsletter to keep any customers you do get in the loop and thinking about you always use direct mail you will get higher than response when you send to existing customers or to people who you already know need what you sell you get that information by purchasing detailed consumer mailing lists  Electronic commerce Tesco Wal-Mart Direct marketing Management Sears Holdings Corporation Amazon.com Trademark United States Postal Service Citigroup Credit card TiVo Superstore America Online Marketing MS-DOS Online marketing Retailer Sega E-mail Advertising Publishing Management information system Network effect Insurance Search engine optimization Online DVD rental Abebooks Marketing research Spam (electronic) Shopping Musical Instrument Digital Interface Verizon Wireless E-mail spam Viral marketing Blog Microsoft Illegal drug trade Apple Computer Aldi Strategic management Embedded system Cable television Intellectual property Spyware Best Buy SCO-Linux controversies Monopoly Mutual fund Phishing Bank Google Commodore International Xbox Television in the United States Digital rights management Fry's Electronics South African Breweries Surveillance Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Opera (web browser) Mergers and acquisitions Amway Digital Subscriber Line Common criticisms of Microsoft Stopping e-mail abuse Blockbuster Video Teletext Sales Lionel Corporation Pharmaceutical company Bose Corporation ITunes Music Store Digital Equipment Corporation Supply and demand The Long Tail Relationship marketing Grey market Filling station DSG International plc RadioShack Motion picture rating system Subscription business model Economics Micropayment Steam (content delivery) Database management system Price discrimination LexisNexis Copyleft Venture capital BMW AMD The Apprentice 2 Microeconomics Investment bank

sales do you think it would be an effective strategy to hire a small army of outside sales people to sell my t shirts and i would give them bucks a sell plus a small bonus and do you think it would be okay to ask for orders and payment in advance all good advice i'm gonna have to let you guys vote for it thanks to all for the ear and the advice do you make custom shirts to order or do you have a bunch of shirts made up already if you have them made up already you will sell more put the salespeople out there with premade ones and do the commission a shirt and if they sell in one day or whatever the number just under the highest sales for the day are now they get an extra for customized shirts have your staff take orders and if it has a persons name on them it would have to be paid in full at the time of the order most likely unless you have a nice display or can do them up at the time of the sale you won't do too many of these if you have a storefront or you personally go to small businesses stores builders etc and show samples of custom made shirts that you can sell for less than the regular stores do because you have no overhead you could do multiples on things that way  Real estate broker Abercrombie & Fitch Co.

inexpensive and free online advertising for a website i am starting an online business and i would like a list of ideas and related information and links on how to inexpensively advertise and get the most bang for my buck if you could include ideas on how to advertise to usa canada uk and ireland new zealand and australia since it will service those countries in this case web advertising would probably be the best idea p s if you could include a range price estimates on google adsense and google's sponsored links section and seo to get organic placement on google for free thanks a bunch if you give a few good answer i will give you to best answer guarantee the most effective way to advertise on the internet is to first set up a website and publish its domain name on major search directories such as google com yahoo com at http www google com addurl and msn com since of internet shoppers rely on these search directories to provide them with goods and services in a sense these search directories are a very large internet yellow pages nevertheless should your website or opening webpage fail to contain generic keywords then anyone using such generic queries will not be able to discover your website your domain name url of your website in a sense will be invisible undiscoverable you may want to consider some simple algorithms which when observed and committed in designing of a website with placement of various critical metatags that can surely achieve a high search engine presence and increase internet traffic to your website these metatag strategies work well with published webpages at google and yahoo design should you create an extensive flash based website make sure to fill in the property entries such as the title description and keywords failing to do so leaves no hard html or alt resource that can be readily indexed by search robots also consider the internet audience and their incoming setup for example if they are on analog dialup flash webpages take too long to load up and therefore analog users will likely lose interest and discontinue entering the flash site on the other hand anyone on hi speed dsl lines will welcome flash pages which load quickly so before designing a pure flash websitge ask the simple question who's my end user is he on dialup or dsl and if you had to choose between these two users for maximum marketability then select analog users since of most resident users are still analog internet subscribers and pure html designed webpages is best for them a non flash based website which relies on hard text is far easier to be indexed by search robots limit the use of stylized text saved as gifs since as a graphic they are not indexable by search robots avoid use of frames since any number of search robots are unable to properly classify textual material placement of metatags a ranking or search order does take place with google and yahoo and it begins with the title metag which should consist of no more than characters separated by commas the title should describe in generic terms the goods and services followed by a location from which the resource is located i e city state the placement of a domain name which is not generic within the title is not appropriate unless your domain name is a major recognizable brand name the second metatag is the description which is usually words to form a complete sentence which best describes one's goods and services and the very last category keywords are also somewhat limited to words which can be plural and compound in nature again avoid multiple entries which could be mistaken as spamdexed entries which is defined as the loading and submission of repetitive words into a particular metatag category spamdexing when discovered on a webpage and reported to google's spamreport com can result in the elimination of your website from their search directory here's an example of a very highly placed website on google com begin with the very generic search query sandwiches downtown los angeles taking note to not abbreviate los angeles to la and of course leave out the parentheses it will bring up some million search results check out where nazos net is ranked it's on the second front ranked again nazos net's high web presence was achieved by proper web design and placement of relevant metatags according to google's publication guidelines good luck

photographing a public golf course legal question the next time i play my favorite golf course i want to take a digital picture of one of my favorite holes and use it as the background image for online and print advertising for my business can i get into big trouble for this probably not this is the section of law called torts whereby you would pay money for the damage the course owner suffered because of you using the photo will the course owner suffer damages it's hard to see how they could and in most cases if they objected they would simply ask you to stop using the photo and never file suit against you however if your actions became known and the course objected the course management could legally refuse to allow you to play the course in the future it's probably much safer is you use the photo and don't identify the course by name and you could always make the photo write and ask permission and then use the photo whether you have permission or not but you'd have a chance of using the photo with permission realistically unless your company is huge the course will probably never become aware of your usage if you took a photo from the internet and that photo was copyrighted about the copyright owner could sue you without showing damages  Copyright Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Fair use SCO-Linux controversies Public domain Tort Copyleft Intellectual property Contract Google MAME Tort reform Negligence Enterprise content management Copyright infringement of software Digital rights management Spyware Recording Industry Association of America Software patent debate First-sale doctrine ROM image Electronic Frontier Foundation Microsoft Personality rights Scientology versus The Internet Prior restraint Photography Copy protection United States Postal Service Copyright law of the United Kingdom Privacy SCO v.

how do i advertise for a tag sale without putting signs on public property our town has recently passed an ordinance banning all signs from public property including street signs tree belts and telephone poles the main way most people advertise is by putting a sign up at the nearby intersection and another at the end of the street however with the new ordinance no one can do that any more i live on a side street that doesn't get much traffic how can i attract potential customers to my tag sale while avoiding the fine that goes along with putting signs up it sounds as if you are a in a small town go to your local radio station i work for a major market cluster and more and more businesses of all sizes are turning to radio i am not quite sure how long the sign ordinance will last when's the next election for city council however for the time being go with radio it's top of mind if the message is clear and concise and not super long you should be able to drive more traffic to your business i am guessing the station's rates are reasonable look at value not prime and just make sure you create a compelling message i wish you well  Advertising Billboard (advertising) West Side Highway Lechaina U.S. Highway 1 Traffic light Direct marketing Ethernet Traffic Woodlands, Singapore Interstate Highway Network effect Music radio Road safety BBC Vehicular cycling Laws of Singapore American Broadcasting Company Political campaign Tobacco advertising Leicester City Centre Management Rules of the road Suburbs of Johannesburg Street Cable television U.S. Highway 66 London Piccadilly Circus Broadband Internet access Grand Theft Auto III UK Singles Chart Computer and video games Bike lane debate Radio Pulaski Skyway Government of France Tag Ann Arbor, Michigan Loudspeaker Beverly Hills, California San Gabriel Valley Boston, Massachusetts Spam (electronic) Freeway Windermere, Florida WNEP-TV Nintendo GameCube Nottingham Citigroup Grand Forks, North Dakota Shopping mall E-mail spam Long Island Rail Road Elis Prefecture Reading, Berkshire Street furniture World Championship Wrestling Queen Street West Intellectual property RSA America Online Search engine optimization King City, Ontario RKO Pictures CPU cache U.S. Highway 91 Filling station Television in the United States AT&T Rugby, Warwickshire Highway Drag racing Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory Transportation of Los Angeles Single Transferable Vote Trademark Marketing Northamptonshire Taxation in the United States Sioux City, Iowa Zoning Internet fraud XERF Grand Central Terminal Air traffic control Electrophysiology Prime Minister of the United Kingdom West University Place, Texas Birmingham Spice Girls Shrewsbury President of Ireland Surveillance Cape Town James Hahn Sydney Pacific, Missouri Public-key cryptography

how to calculate the number of the marketing materials for a tv station for children i'm making a production plan for branding a tv station for children so i need some help figuring the amount of promos teasers and fillers for the first qaurter month when it comes to branding i don't think you can ever have enough marketing research tells us that for every times we see something it will probably only register once and then it might take times for something to register before someone will take any action how many events can you hit the same audience with to get the repeated exposure in a short period of time what are you doing for cross promotional opportunities with a tv station there are probably several lower cost things you can do to drive traffic to a web site that will act as a relationship builder which is probably more effective than a branding campaign unless of course you have a budget like coca cola if you want to shoot me a message to talk more visit my web site www hollnerpromos com  Advertising Welding UK Singles Chart Apple Computer Direct marketing The Internet Movie Database Trademark Web traffic Television commercial Music video Microeconomics The Coca-Cola Company New Coke Virgin Mobile Tobacco advertising Coca-Cola America Online Insurance Fountain pen Marketing Economy of Peru G.I.

what is the best approach when presenting a product or service to a potential client face to face direct mail or something else please explain why it is best thanks for instance let's say a person owns a business and wants to get their business noticed by their target customer client would it likely be better to try to call and contact potential clients by phone or send them information through the mail every option has its plus and minus point in effectiveness and cost consideration there is no single best approach generally it all depends on what type of product or services you want to sell here's what you should identify first who is your market is it end consumer or businesses how many are they millions hundreds what type of product do you sell technical or non technical what is the pricing level high in thousands couple of dollars what is the margin very high or very thin face to face is very effective but it is very inefficient to do face to face sales for a non technical product with a thin margin that costs only a couple of bucks to thousands of consumer in one week e mail is better in this case generally face to face is the best but with a heavy cost mail is less effective but is the most cheapest and can reach a higher number of prospects any other methods are in between hope this helps  Microeconomics Customer relationship management Monopoly Tax E-mail spam Marketing Management Citigroup Internet fraud Direct marketing Labour economics United States Postal Service Gross domestic product Mergers and acquisitions Value added tax Illegal drug trade Privatization Monetary policy Advertising FairTax Public good Pharmaceutical company Information Services Procurement Library Wal-Mart Insurance Call centre Tesco Broadband Internet access Business process reengineering Economics Bulk vending Inflation Price discrimination Marketing research Investment bank ITunes Music Store Relationship marketing Outsourcing Welfare economics Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Transformer Identity theft Computer and video game industry CompuServe Profit maximization Network effect Financial services Sales Voice over IP Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Phishing Progressive tax Stopping e-mail abuse Tariff Subscription business model Digital photography Verizon Wireless Primerica Financial Services MMORPG Amway Enterprise resource planning Rational Unified Process Microsoft Office Principal-agent problem Solar cell Telemarketing United Kingdom corporation tax Airline Strategic management Law of value Monopsony Dot-com Denial-of-service attack Gmail Database marketing Intellectual property Enterprise content management Loyalty business model Credit card Sales force management system Pyramid scheme Stock market CPU design Marketing mix Nuclear weapon design Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Short selling Real estate broker Productive and unproductive labour Hydrogen economy FidoNet Capitalism Future energy development Measures of national income and output

why has advertising become so boring excellent question in short blame the colleges that are churning out marketing executives who end up working on the client side of things it used to be that there was a kind of mystique to advertising a skill that only some could do well in the same way that only some people can write great songs or tell a joke well now every marketing grad thinks not only that they can do it but that they know what works best so instead of letting the really talented people at the agencies get on it with it they end up putting themselves in the process directing the ideas along and most often ruining them in the process don't even get me started on the reliance on consumer insight focus groups those rooms full of ordinary folk who are given some sandwiches to snack on and asked to evaluate the ads before they go on the air it's an unreal environment we don't sit at home thinking hmm that typography could be different and i would like this ad more or perhaps a dog in this commercial would make it more likeable it's all contributed to ruining the good ideas that are out there  The Apprentice 2 Advertising Advertising agency Citigroup Philosophy of language Theory of conduct Leadership Star Trek: Enterprise Milton H.

what is your tip on marketing give your tip on marketing such as put instead of dollar to give the illusion of being cheaper sell items higher price but making the customer believe he she's buying it a good price do you know marketing is actually a noble activity marketers fulfil needs http iws ohiolink edu moti homedefinition html needs of customers not the marketer's but most of the time people misuse it to rip the consumer off for their own benefit if we strive for extreme profit by manipulating the information we will just survive for a short time in your first example don't misjudge psychological tactics as unethics even though the price has cents quotation it is still cheaper by cent right but for your second example that is simply lying which is of course unethic unless you obviously want to follow this route you have to explain why it is more expensive its not a taboo selling something at a higher price but you must justify it if you cannot simply find any reason to charge higher you are just lying which is good if you want to reap instant profit and hang your boot in the near future then again its not marketing it's because you are fulfilling your own needs it's a legal scam  Microeconomics Marketing Health insurance Illegal drug trade Arbitrage Internet fraud MMORPG Predatory lending Price discrimination PE ratio Capitalism Search engine optimization Bulk vending Supply and demand Tax Mutual fund Monopoly Euro ITunes Music Store Black market Microsoft Bond Monetary policy Labor theory of value Free trade Electronic commerce Privatization Inflation Tariff Gross domestic product Advertising Deflation (economics) Outsourcing Grey market Economics Wal-Mart Public good Dot-com Citigroup Ra (board game) RuneScape cheats Publicly funded medicine Auto insurance Productive and unproductive labour Enron Corporation Asian financial crisis Prices of production Rational pricing Insurance Airline Exchange rate Network effect Intellectual property Sport utility vehicle Arguments for and against drug prohibition Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Vending machine Digital photography Short selling Ethical consumerism Day trading Pyramid scheme RuneScape economy Price gouging Bank CPU design Commodity Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Externality Amway Public policy Surplus value Mortgage Clothing RuneScape skills Electrophysiology Strategic management Confidence trick Poker jargon Law of value Phishing Filling station Dividend United States dollar Islamic banking Economic shortage Laserdisc Manitoba Hydro Apple Macintosh Technical analysis Criticisms of socialism Tesco American individualist anarchism Say's law

why doesn't disney channel have outside commercials they only have commercials for shows and other things within the channel i'd have to imagine they are losing a ton of money in advertising most people are already used to having commercials on all the other channels so it's not like they would lose any significant amount of viewers i'd have to imagine some companies would be willing to pay a fortune to air a commercial on a popular channel like that anyone know the reasoning behind it it used to be a pay channel before it was basic cable so they didn't have commercial breaks then they decided not to introduce them  Cable television ITV Television in the United States Disney Channel Television commercial Channel 4 BBC MTV Fox News Public Broadcasting Service Television network High-definition television KCAL-TV Soap opera Max Headroom The Amazing Race Wheel of Fortune CBS TiVo Television syndication Action potential Sex and the City ABC Family The Walt Disney Company NFL on television 24 (television) Five (TV) Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

how long on ebay does it take after listing an item for it to show up in search results im selling items on ebay and when i go to my ebay then to the items im selling its been over an hour since it says they started but when i search them on ebay they dont show up in the search results what happened it can take a couple of hours between and a lot of people will usually increase the cost of mailing an item by an additional cents and using the extra cents you can set a time and day for when your item begins selling that way their website ebay has enough time to set up your item and give it the full amount of time instead of listing it right away keep in mind since your item will end at the same time you listed it as either hours days etc you can also set up the time to cooridinate when your item is finished  Amazon.com Live 8 Neopets Network effect Online auction business model Gmail Topps Labour economics Yahoo!

how cna an organization use more than one type of organizational design nope i'm in for the game i believe the matrix chart is a hybrid of organizational design which combines divisional departmental and other types of structures apart from reporting straight to immediate superior subordinate cross report to other related superiors as well this should reduce the bureaucracy involved in decision making thus improving the efficiency in communication but it can be a great hair wire as decisions are made by different decision makers on a particular issue unless you have a great it platform to enhance collaboration between the superiors effectively or a very limited people in the organization you should just stick to a single organizational design  Organisation Strategic management Organizational culture Corporate governance Workplace democracy Hierarchy Trade union Incident Command System Tank Bureaucracy RISC Cross-functional team Antenna (radio) SAS System Organizational communication ISO 9000 Consensus decision-making Management Computer-supported collaboration Hybrid vehicle Innovation Appeal Enterprise content management IBM PC compatible Division (military) Dot matrix printer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Jet engine Natural monopoly Independent Media Center Computer PlayStation 3 Rise of Nations Information Services Procurement Library Enterprise architecture Fuel injection Principal-agent problem New Hampshire Supreme Court Transformer Common Alerting Protocol Defense Logistics Agency Atari 8-bit family Aircraft carrier Organization development Communications management Compiler optimization Golf club (equipment) Crime prevention through environmental design Strategic planning Welding Poker jargon National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Debian Product Lifecycle Management Robert McNamara Utility cycling Past and present anarchist communities USA PATRIOT Act Royal Navy in the 21st Century Military strategy Emergency position-indicating rescue beacon Information warfare DVD C plus plus Scene graph War Relationship marketing Sarbanes-Oxley Act Anarchism and society Table saw Leadership Sport utility vehicle Communist Party of China Chemotherapy Windows XP Korean War Court system of Canada Bionics Car handling Charter school Decision support system Administrative law of the United States Antiretroviral drug Business continuity planning PowerPC Reliability engineering Nutrition Business intelligence Toyota Prius Battery electric vehicle Demarchy Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses Management information system Drill bit Tooth enamel Nuclear weapon design Hard disk New Republic (Star Wars) Hong Kong Monetary Authority Airbus A380

does anyone have experience with agloco i just came across this website www agloco com has anyone been with them for more then a month any experience i should i know about before even considering a trial looks like a 'advertising driven' web browsing 'tracker' with some element of pyramid selling 'referrals' basically it claims to only monitor your browsing activity and only reports that it's like having some one look over you shoulder as you browse i guess some people are comfortable with that however it seems the term 'toolbar' is intended to put users at ease in reality it's a full blown application that has full access to your system and has direct access to the internet i e bypasses the browser to report home so if you are ok with installing something that might be a little more aggressive at monitoring your pc's use for example it might be logging your every keystroke go ahead see link looks like the initial 'toolbar' app was a bit flaky  Spyware Mozilla Firefox Windows XP Internet Explorer Mozilla Application Suite Kazaa Emacs Opera (web browser) World Wide Web Search engine optimization BitTorrent Phishing Web traffic Comparison of web browsers Browser Helper Object Netscape Browser Gmail Windows 2000 Web browser Tabbed document interface Website Malware Google Pop-up ad Internet privacy Cascading Style Sheets Wireless Application Protocol Web accessibility Web application Mac OS X America Online Internet Explorer for Mac Web crawler Uniform Resource Locator Timeline of computing 1990-forward User interface HTTP cookie Broadband Internet access Ajax (programming) Proxy server Internet Explorer shell Domain Name System Object Desktop Password Neopets Python programming language E-mail spam Atari ST AOL Instant Messenger Google search Macintosh Finder Microsoft Web design Enterprise content management History of the Internet PlayStation Portable TikiWiki Steam (content delivery) Damn Small Linux Macromedia Flash Netscape Communications Corporation Wiki Microsoft Windows Server XML United States v.

how to promote for those of you who have worked the mary kay or avon business how did you go about promoting and getting customers i'm in a business similar to mary kay and avon thank you it doesn t make any difference what kind of business you have or want to have every business is a people business the exact same qs each of my mentors asked me i m going to ask you in return you must be honest with yourself who knows you better than you no one except y o u you who knows your habits better than you no one except y o u you who knows what your wants needs dreams and desires are better than you no one except y o u you who knows what you like and dislike better than you no one except y o u you as you can see i took the liberty of answering the questions for you am i right i would like to inform you what possibly not to do then what you should do then you should be able to make your decisions and proceed from there don't fax every person you know or met about your services its not necessary many people know who you are and what you do don t they don t be a pest or don t make a pest of yourself don't text message folks for the same reasons don't use direct mail to promote your service some time ago i read a statistic which may or may not be true today for every piece of direct mail a company or an individual sends only in will respond to that direct mail promotion at today's postal rates st class that's you could use for other purposes that's the cost just for postage for the response this does not include the cost of buying the stationery and envelopes toner etc just to get the appointment is in about your costs are accelerating aren't they and you still don't have a sale it takes about piece of direct mail to generate appointment it takes about to direct mail pieces to get just one appointment all the way to writing the oreer that's about to before you see one dollar not to mention your time spinning your wheels wasting your time you haven't made the sale yet don't lease or spend notice i didn't write invest your hard earned money for a piece of equipment with automatic phone dialing and recording speaking features telling folks about your specials and services do you like getting those telemarketing calls do you like or mind getting any telemarketing calls if i haven't discouraged you we'll move on to the grey area cold canvassing its a terrific way to meet people face to face one on one it requires going to the same places and offices about once every two weeks or even more frequently to save yourself some time you may have to make a presentation in front of a nice group of folks just for them to see you're a real live breathing cooperative knowledgeable individual you know your product you know how to solve various situations problems which arise on a regular basis when you don't know how to solve those problems you know what hoops and hurdles you have to jump over under around and through to speak with the right person to get the answers and solutions to make your sales the above are the don'ts here are a couple dos a very long time ago probably over years ago my dad went to a seminar presented by elmer wheeler when my dad came home he took a plain piece of white paper and a black crayon and wrote in big letters don t sell the steak sell the sizzle when i sell the sizzle the steak will sell itself he put it on the night table on his side of the bed he looked at it day and evening he did the same with other sayings he discovered or created he put them on either side of the medicine chest in the office in his cars and other places btw dad the old man as my three younger brothers and i affectionately refer to him is years young still works almost every day not because he has to but because he wants to he loves his work working with young people helping them become successful in many aspects of the real estate business and so do his sons with the work and careers each aspired to your product is the sizzle you are the steak you have to be able to effectively and enthusiastically tell folks what is so terrific about your product and why they should buy it from y o u and what about the cost of your business cards do you think you can cut corners and make a good impression with those thin flat lifeless computer generated cards please do yourself a huge favor invest your time to sit down and properly design your business cards if you aren't sure please go to a professional printer or graphic arts store and ask for help and guidance those folks should amaze you with ideas and concepts in the long run good professionally printed business cards with raised lettering and features go a long way to show others you care about yourself about your business and about your clients when you leave a client customer all your contacts customers and clients have left are two things good bad or indifferent the impression you left your business card don't you think it makes good sense to invest your money in a good quality business card have your cards professionally printed invest you time and money joining local groups with the same interests you have be active examples do you like to watch birds join and be active in a bird watching group club society etc do you like to quilt do the same bake do the same love going to church temple or mosque do the same get on committees get to be known as a can do type of person you should have fun and yes some aggravation too you should make some friends and begin building your client base you should get leads and look how much time money and aggravation you'll save lots as the saying goes build a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your door what the saying doesn't tell anyone or even mention is you must get out there and let the world know about that better mousetrap you must do it tactfully and tastefully i wish you well vty ron b  Surveillance Extreme Programming Internet fraud Enterprise content

what is the best way to obtain business partners and customers i am a consultant for a nationally know cosmetics company its the party plan kind of business i am looking for ways to grow my business with new loyal customers and business partners any suggestions p s please don't regard this as spam since i have not included the company name or any further contact information thanks i won't repeat the excellent answer you've already been given above but i've been a speaker at large meetings for consultants of several major party plan companies who offer cosmetics so i totally understand the challenges you face the reason why imho many women keep looking for new new new ways to grow their business and get customers and partners is because they're uncomfortable with what they've been told by their upline they need to do why are they uncomfortable because getting out there and approaching people feels totally foreign and uncomfortable to many women who were raised to wait for people to come to them the result is that we wait for customers to call us the same way we waited for the cute boy in high school history class to call us for a date so if the thought of marketing and selling in your business practically drives you to chocolate read on the truth is in your business there are many ways you can meet new customers in your day to day life but none of them will work if you just feel too uncomfortable or you love meeting and talking with people about your products and your opportunity but you hate asking them for anything a sale to have a party at their home etc marketing and selling is never about us it's about doing something that will appeal to our customers so that they will take the next step and buy from us so if you keep looking for ways to market and sell that are comfortable to you you are making it about you it's not it's about the customer the minute we try to make it about us it fails i'm the author of a popular myth shattering book that's all about the mars venus reasons why women have so many challenges when it comes to marketing and selling now that we are starting businesses at double the rate of men it all boils down to making different conscious choices and coming out of your comfort zone because your business growth won't happen any faster than your personal growth what does this mean it means that every time you say ooh i couldn't do that you are slowing down the potential growth of your business my experience after mentoring over women and men in marketing is that women keep looking for new ways to get customers not because the way they were told didn't work but because it made them uncomfortable i'm not suggesting anything out of integrity here for many women just walking up and initiating a conversation is mortifying to them when i get a new client for my marketing mentoring practise i ask my prospective clients about their business and what they want to achieve i also answer all their questions about what the process of marketing mentoring is like my fees etc towards the end of the conversation i ask them five questions they are always the same five questions and those five questions result in a yes and a new client about percent of the time that's an closing rate which anyone experienced in sales will tell you is amazingly good especially for an expensive service because those five questions are so effective i've never changed them do i like those questions the first three i like i love hearing people's answers i've grown a little bored with the questions but it's not about me my client hasn't heard those questions before and that's all that matters the last two questions i have to take a deep breath and pull up my courage a bit before i ask because i'm asking for a yes i know i have about an probability of a yes but still a possibility of a no and nobody wants to hear a no so does it make me a little uncomfortable sure would my business practise go down in the number of clients and hence revenues if i didn't ask those last two questions you bet so increasing your confidence level especially as a woman is one of the very best ways to increase your number of customers because all the things you've been told to do will work become effortless and you start saying wow this really works it was just me who wasn't working it all the best denise michaels author testosterone free marketing get the book at http www tfmbook com http www mentoringwithdenise com  Milton H.

what are the channels i need to go through to become part of an advertising agency hey im only a year old boy but i have ambitions on becoming part of an advertising agency helping clients with their developed products for their customers possibly in ny since i live there i came here to ask what do i need to take in high school that will look good on my resume for the certain college i need to go to to become part of an agency i'm really good at art particulary in drawing photography graphic design if theres other skills that i will need just tell me basically can someone just tell me the process im going to need to go through to be become part of an advertising agency uhm thanks ok can someone please give me a straight out answer seesh immature weirdo and does anyone know any good agencies out there in ny from the u s department of labor bureau of labor statistics career guide to industries employees in advertising and public relations services should have good people skills common sense creativity communication skills and problem solving ability foreign language skills have always been important for those wanting to work abroad for domestic firms or to represent foreign firms domestically however these skills are increasingly vital to reach linguistic minorities in u s cities such as los angeles new york miami houston and phoenix new media such as the internet are creating opportunities to market products but also are increasing the need for additional training for those already employed keeping pace with technology is fundamental to success in the industry in addition advertisers must keep in tune with the changing values cultures and fashions of the nation most entry level professional and managerial positions in advertising and public relations services require a bachelor s degree preferably with broad liberal arts exposure beginners in advertising usually enter the industry in the account management or media department occasionally entry level positions are available in the market research or creative departments of an agency but these positions usually require some experience completing an advertising related internship while in school provides an advantage when applying for an entry level position in fact internships are becoming a necessary step to obtaining permanent employment in addition to an internship courses in marketing psychology accounting statistics and creative design can help prepare potential entrants for careers in this field assistant account executive positions the entry level account management occupation in most firms require a bachelor s degree in marketing or advertising although some firms require a master s degree in business administration bachelor s degrees are not required for entry level positions in the creative department assistant art directors usually need at least a year degree from an art or design school although assistant copywriters do not need a degree obtaining one helps to develop the superior communication skills and abilities required for this job assistant media planner or assistant media buyer also are good entry level positions but almost always require a bachelor s degree preferably with a major in marketing or advertising experienced applicants who possess at least a master s degree usually fill research positions often they have a background in marketing or statistics and years of experience requirements for support services and administrative positions depend on the job and vary from firm to firm in public relations employers prefer applicants with degrees in communications journalism english or business some year colleges and universities have begun to offer a concentration in public relations because there is keen competition for entry level public relations jobs workers are encouraged to gain experience through internships co op programs or one of the formal public relations programs offered across the country however these programs are not available everywhere so most public relations workers get the bulk of their training on the job at some firms this training consists of formal classroom education but in most cases workers train under the guidance of senior account executives or other experienced workers gradually familiarizing themselves with public relations work entry level workers often start as research or account assistants and may be promoted to account executive account supervisor vice president and executive vice president for information about careers or training contact american association of advertising

what types of advertising have i not tapped i am a salesman at a car dealership in a small town we sell high end cars and have alot of different brands and models so it's hard to keep a huge selection in stock it's a blue collar town and we sell the most expensive gm vehicles available so we end up selling alot of used cars vs new we are also right on a major interstate so we get lots of highway traffic my question is assuming that i have all the basics in place longstanding dealership good salespeople good prices etc what type of advertising have we not thought of we have done all the silly mailers and the huge purple gorilla on the roof approach but we are looking for more reality based advertising i was thinking of crazy ideas but wanted to know if anyone had any suggestions assuming that i can't control what the factory offers i e special financing like zero percent that i can't give away thousands of dollars to every customer i e free gas for three years jeez and assuming that nothing is really free free ipod with every car dealers are happy to try and fool you into thinking that but it's never free then what do i do other than start selling junk hyundais thank you for the responses but if you can't answer the question don't just take the opportunity to tout your exploding korean junk in my american made general motors face thank you on with the answers i am looking for something unique and of course my advertising strategy is direct and honest i established that this is what our business has been founded on in the small town for the past years i need something unique that we could maybe do semi anually that has nothing to do with selling cars something that the people of a small town will look forward to every year that would be perfect keep in touch with current customers if someone bought a car years ago go ahead and give them a call see if they are in the market again since most people have cars you may hit them at the right time or maybe just before they realize they want a new car do the mailers you may not want to do this but i thought is was a good idea once before a car lot gives a customer who buys a new car a few coupons with their name on it if they give these out to their friends and they come and test drive a car you send them if they buy a car you send them they could give the cards to friends who just come buy to test drive a car so they can get the money but isn't much and it gives you chance to talk to them put them on a mailing or call list i hate big gimmick's myself makes a company look worse then it is like you just want to get the money while selling junk if you're selling higher end cars huge purple gorillas just don't tell me your high end you have to look and advertise on the higher market if you want their business if the cars and trucks are pricey higher class then you need to up promotion to be higher class target those who did buy the cars and ask those people what sold them to your dealership and use that approach to sell more  Ford Motor Company Wayne Corporation Mutual fund Microeconomics Advertising Insurance Marketing Illegal drug trade Yugo Sport utility vehicle IPod Bond Internet fraud Direct marketing Chrysler Corporation Edsel Asian financial crisis Citigroup Poker jargon Hyundai Motor Company Toyota Prius Audi Sales promotion Best Buy Sears Holdings Corporation Daewoo Tesco Taxicab Hybrid vehicle Automobile BMW Filling station Inflation Neopets Price discrimination Arbitrage Sales Mercedes-Benz Economics Tariff Chevrolet Camaro Toyota Camry Commodore International $ale of the Century Manual transmission Rules of the road Credit card 2000 Australian Grand Prix Apple Computer Make money fast Monopoly (game) Anonymous remailer AvtoVAZ Bank Wal-Mart Vehicle registration plate Capital accumulation Dodge Charger PE ratio Berkshire Hathaway The Apprentice 2 Volkswagen Honda Apple Macintosh Public transport Game show Google Major League Baseball television contracts Life insurance IBM PC compatible Floppy disk Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Stock E-mail spam Gross domestic product Enron Corporation Studebaker Privatization Hyundai Motor Group Mad Money Truck Monetary policy Keynesian economics John De Lorean George Costanza Predatory lending Amway Craps Mazda

hi i am on a l visa could you tell me if it is legal to generate revenue using yahoo or google adsense hi imisidro thanks for the reply i heard that with l we can work only for the employer who sponsored it in that case would it be legal to use my spouse for adsense if you have an l visa and you have ead employment authorization and ssn then you can start a business in the us with adsense or yahoo but if you don't have an ead then you are in a precarious position i suggest you consult your immigration lawyer as to the best possible course of action what you don't want down the road is to have any impediments when you start the process of getting your permanent residency or green card both adsense and ypn gives out tax forms at the end of the year and reports to the irs their publishers income if uscis sees irs record that you have an income from starting a business with your l visa without ead then that may have adverse consequences on your green card application otherwise you can apply to google adsense but not to ypn giving your home country address and information not as someone living here in the us that way google adsense will not send any tax information about your income from adsense to the irs otherwise you can have your spouse who is on l visa to apply for adsense and use their account info instead of you  H-1B visa Visa (document) Taxation in the United States Mail-order bride United Kingdom corporation tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tax protester Credit card 401(k) Identity theft Indian nationality law U.S. Internal Revenue Service U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services REAL ID Act Divorce Search engine optimization Plame affair AdSense FairTax Social Security (United States) Internet fraud Marriage Illegal immigration Identity document Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Social Security number (United States) Tax avoidance/evasion Tax Schengen treaty Google search Life insurance Flat tax Home Return Permit National Insurance Income tax Network effect United States Postal Service Passport British nationality law David Blunkett Notary public Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Civil unions in the United Kingdom Consensus decision-making Right of return British national identity card British National (Overseas) - Hong Kong Employer identification number Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks BAE Systems Offshore bank Bank fraud Right of abode Copyleft Appeal Expert system Driver's license Domain Name System Debit card Irish nationality law Progressive tax National identification number George W.

what would you do if selling something through paypal and the recipients address is nigeria the person has asked for an invoice for the goods from me paid the money even after i explained that what they want to pay for my item is too much money as its cheaper to buy brand new they still paid it and the shipping address is nigeria does it sound dodgy to anybody in paypal it doesnt say the money has been received but i did have an email from what looks to be from paypal saying this person has made the transaction she says she lives in the us and the goods she purchased are to be sent to her son in a missionary school in lagos nigeria edit auction overpayment fake check in another updated scam the scammer offers to buy some expensive item e g jewelry or a car that the prospective victim advertised on ebay for example or a legitimate classified ads website such as craigslist by official certified bank or cashier's check the check will have an accidentally or mutually agreed higher value than the price of the item so the scammer asks the victim to wire the extra money to some third party as soon as the check clears because banks in the usa are required by law to honor a check within working days even before a check has cleared they will report the proceeds as available for withdrawal before the check is presented to the issuing bank for clearance and the fraud is discovered most banks will hold the victim accountable for the value of the counterfeit check there is a simple way to avoid many instances of ebay auction overpayment fraud the scammer usually or always wants to buy the merchandise immediately so if the auction offers a buy it now option the scammer will use it to end the auction request shipping and offer the overpayment if the seller detects the scam and refuses to sell the item they risk the scammer posting negative feedback therefore if the seller avoids offering buy it now the scammer will be able only to send the seller a message requesting to buy the item immediately for an overpayment the seller can then deny or simply ignore the request the scammer does have the option of participating in and winning the auction because the check they'll use is fraudulent they can bid however much is necessary if a seller's auction is ended by someone clicking buy it now there is still a way to detect scamming the buyer will ask the seller to ship to a different address the buyer will hide the address until he she sends the seller a shipping label to print the shipping label's information may reveal a faraway address often in lagos nigeria that the seller may not have wanted to ship to however this is often not the case anymore most scammers are simply after the cash from the return of the overpayment and do not want the item unless it is highly valuable to the scammer such as cell phones and laptops the shipping address many times is real and located in the u s in this case the address is usually a mule another scam victim who has been conned or otherwise convinced into accepting the packages and either forwarding them to the scammer or holding them indefinitely a variation on the ebay scam involves sending a request for payment for an item that the alleged seller does not own but the scammer claims they have sent since actual ebay item numbers are used this has been a nuisance for legitimate sellers  Bank fraud Neopets E-mail spam Diablo II: Lord of Destruction PayPal Electronic commerce Spam (electronic) MMORPG Mutual fund Plame affair Supply and demand MapleStory Mail-order bride Stopping e-mail abuse Insurance Life insurance Islamic banking Arbitrage Fraud Scam baiting Credit card Live 8 Tax Surveillance Mortgage United States Postal Service Credit card fraud Illegal drug trade Bulk vending Money Pyramid scheme Click fraud Estoppel Something Awful Forums Make money fast Liberty Dollar Wal-Mart Gmail Google Annuity Bank Autograph Money supply Option Price discrimination Short selling Schabir Shaik Trial Futures contract Warranty Real estate broker Automatic teller machine Hyperinflation Bond Something Awful Best Buy Advertising Stock Oil-for-Food Programme Network effect Online auction business model Rational pricing Monopoly (game) Mensal__o scandal Anonymity Commodity markets Art forgery Derivative (finance) Amazon.com Financial markets Bluetooth Call option Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Poker jargon Dot-com ROM image CPU cache 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio FairTax Data retention Privatization Social Security debate (United States) Cheque Conveyancing

i am opening an advertising company and i need to know something would small to medium sized companies want to advertise their logo in a very large mall their logo would be seen by tens of thousands of people per week if so what would be a good price to charge them the value is very low in my opinion while my logo would be seen by potentially hundreds a day the attention factor is missing they may not know what i do or why they should do business with me i can only presume anyway as i do not know fully how you are implementing this idea i place a higher value on advertising that is response oriented rather than awareness because it generates far greater results if you could find a way to integrate that element into what you are doing placing a small caption under logo ask for our brochure inside and take advantage of this months special you will be able to justify a higher fee if someone were walking by and saw my logo and had a moment of curiosity about it i would want some way for them to act on it right then  Logo Apple Computer Quebec general election, 2003 Advertising ITV Intel CPU design Airline CPU cache Marketing Management MMORPG Broadband Internet access Sexual orientation Unemployment Montreal London Congestion Charge Gas metal arc welding Inflation Nuclear fusion Management information system Home Box Office Chernobyl accident Insurance Strategic management Action potential Am730 Fusion power Internet fraud Hash table Extreme Programming UK Singles Chart Normal distribution Blockbuster Video Wal-Mart Monopoly Eaton's Joseph Louis Lagrange Network effect Central processing unit Cable television Urban sprawl Sears Holdings Corporation Digital Equipment Corporation Google Welding Supply and demand RKO Pictures Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Resident Evil: Apocalypse Filling station Tesco RISC Micropayment FedEx Corporation Short selling Digital photography Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Best Buy Predatory lending Education in the People's Republic of China Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Compiler optimization Tennessee State Constitution North American Numbering Plan Publicly funded medicine Amiga Power Corporate governance DVD Pebble bed reactor Philo Spacecraft propulsion Scientology beliefs and practices Pretty Good Privacy Television in the United States Mutual fund Web traffic BBC Tesco Ireland Pharmaceutical company Person Education in Portugal Food and Drug Administration Integrated circuit Laserdisc Cascading Style Sheets Arbitrage Freedom of speech Transformer Taxation in the United States Trademark Dot-com Democracy Tobacco advertising Mercedes-Benz __lectricit__ de France Credit card Economic inequality Open source culture Keynesian economics
