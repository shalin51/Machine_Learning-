where do our income taxes go when we pay them i know there are several different taxes the taxes on gas go to build roads and bridges etc the tax on corporate gains goes to funding our wars and etc but what about federal income taxes we americans altogether pay out out trillions each week and yet we have a national debt and today central banks all around the world put money into their monetary systems to prevent a credit crunch why intelligent answers only please and any sites you can show me for more information would be helpful firstly taxes exist for several reasons to control the economy high taxes to reduce spending and prevent inflation and vice versa to redistribute income high earners see their income taxed which is transferred to low income earners through food stamps and other credits as you said to pay for roads and in the case of america to finance the war why america has a national debt is primarily becaue of the war trillions and trillions are spent and this expenditure far exceeds the income received through various taxes hence the debt and then of course the consumer themselves are guzzilng imports the money crunch comes about because of the huge deficit in america just imagine who's giving all this money to amercica to spend other countries are especially china and japan who finance amercia's deficit by buying amercia's bonds and bills now can america pay all this just what is going to haapen if amercai defaults on this debt a credit crunch that's what's going to happen banks in china and other lender countries will see all their loans unpaid and as a result savers in those countries will see their money lost becasue of the defaulted loans this is the reason everyone is freaked about the credit crunch if america defaults you might see your savings wiped out sorry i really have no websites to give you but i can give some books but i don't know whether they are avalible firstly j k galbraith the crash the debt crisis by darrell delamaide cheers elin  Hyperinflation Economy of Russia Debt Inflation U.S. public debt Economy of the United States Money Mortgage Deflation (economics) FairTax Credit card Bank Money supply Tax Taxation in the United States Bond Deficit spending Monetary policy Economy of Pakistan Great Depression Economy of India Gold standard Bretton Woods system Asian financial crisis Supply-side economics Arthur Laffer Capital accumulation Social Security debate (United States) Social Security (United States) History of the United States (1918-1945) Microeconomics Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Finance Economy of Chile Economy of Argentina Gross domestic product Tax cut Economy of Ghana Keynesian economics Security (finance) Capitalism Economic history of the United States Privatization History of the United States (1980-1988) Deficit Economy of South Africa Economy of Romania Economy of the People's Republic of China Social Credit Reaganomics Economy of Nigeria Central bank Personal finance Marshall Plan Flat tax Economy of El Salvador Student loan Euro Federal Reserve Canadian federal election, 1993 Tariff Bank fraud Financial markets Free trade Economy of Papua New Guinea Interest Monetary and fiscal policy of Japan Corporation Developing countries' debt Annuity Monetarism Measures of national income and output Productive and unproductive labour Economy of Mexico History of post-Soviet Russia International Monetary Fund United Kingdom corporation tax New Deal Fiat money Surplus value Economy of Greece Life insurance Economy of Senegal Derivative (finance) Insurance Canadian and American economies compared Balanced Budget Amendment Publicly funded medicine Economy of Africa Economic history of Spain World economy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Kazakhstan Economy of Brazil Fractional-reserve banking Microcredit

how do i copyright my million dollar ideas i have multi million dollar ideas on movies and video games before how do i copywright before i go forth and contacting microsoft and discovery channel ideas cannot be copyrighted only the expression of ideas federal statutory copyright comes into existence when you fix the idea in a tangible medium of expression however you gain additional rights by placing a copyright notice on it either by placing the word copyright or the c in a circle symbol your name and the year in which you fixed it in a tangible medium of expression and when you register the work with the register of copyright whose office is located in the library of congress you can get the forms to register your copyright online at www copyright gov register you will still face risks when you write down your idea writing is the most common form of fixation in a tangible medium of expression your writing is protected but not necessarily your idea for example you can copyright your idea for an airplane dogfight game but this does not stop others from developing their own dogfight game using the same general idea but an expression of that idea that is different than yours mere ideas are not a subject for copyright but specific fixed expressions such as writings or drawings or a combination of both are patent protection is sometimes available as well but copyright is faster and far less expensive actually there is one way to protect your idea which is by contract if you can get the company that you want to pitch your idea to to agree that they will pay you the reasonable value of the idea that you are about to disclose to them before you disclose it that will work the drawback in this method is that none of the companies that you would like to pay you will agree to such a procedure if you could get them to agree though the contract method would work a registered copyright is better protection than not having one good luck  Public domain Copyright Intellectual property United States copyright law Patent Software patent debate Copyleft United States Copyright Act of 1976 Fair use Open source culture First-sale doctrine Microeconomics Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act SCO-Linux controversies Contract United States Postal Service Copy protection GNU General Public License Copyright infringement of software Copyright infringement Copyright law of the United Kingdom MP3 Intellectual rights to magic methods Leasing Apple Computer Property (ownership right) Software patent Corporation Warez Freedom of speech Patent application Digital rights management Inflation Crown copyright Act of Parliament Copyright Term Extension Act Microsoft Software patents under TRIPs Agreement Directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions Welding Japanese copyright law National Kidney Foundation Singapore Nintendo Law Article One of the United States Constitution Mutual fund Life insurance Productive and unproductive labour Administrative law of the United States Software license Video game crash of 1983 Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Supply and demand Insurance Betting (poker) Idea Advance fee fraud Eldred v.

what my son should do in a case of corruption in the company he started working as a trainee in a oil company in houston tx and he supposed to be for months in training and after weeks they fired him the persons who did that have a long history of stealing and corruption one of them has been fired from many companies due to frauds his son stole in the company dollars they didn't gave him a warning they need to give him at least in order to fired him but the reality check is that they are my husband worst enemies not open but everyones knows it they fired a secretary who complain of sexual harrassment the other secretary saw him stealing the ez tags that you use to pay tollway and he takes it everyday to his vehicle and put it back to the companies vehicles how it is possible that the people who are in higher positions don't know about all this how you can contact those people in order to stop the corruption and the abuse of power there how the law protect the employees texas don't have unions please help he has college education fully bilingual in the conference with them hie made very clear of the poor management from their part one of them is canadian and buys from canada all the nuts and screws and bolts and in samll amounts due to this the company loses million of dollars because they failed to the clients that the job is not on time for the lack of tools and stuff like that the canadian guy thinks that the united states is a banana republic that we don't do tools and he gets everythinf from his country how can we contact the ceo of this company to pay attention to all that madness it is a bunch of families affected for those men who behave like a mafia and control everything there somebody has to stop them my son is single and he can get another job but the men and women who support the families has been affected terribly please give some advice of how can we make a difference god blees you all his father works there and the secretaries who were involved in the problems talk about it after what happened to my son they call us and said the human resources don't work for the employees benefit and well being nothing happened after that there is really nothing you can do or should do if this company is really being run the way you describe it will run itself into the ground soon enough you go on to describe what you consider corruption and abuse of power which includes an employee stealing toll bridge passes how do you know that this isn't an agreed upon perk for this specific employee one of my employees has a gas card that i have asked him to be discreet about using and you also complain about a canadian manager ordering parts from a canadian company because he doesn't trust american manufacturers this isn't an example of abuse of power this is just how they have decided to run their business you said that your son brought all of their poor management issues up in a conference with them that's probably a major contributing factor in his dismissal adding in the fact that he has talked about sensitive company issues the company loses millions and has unhappy customers due to untimely jobs with his mother is a good example of him not putting the company's interests above his own whether that is a legitimate reason for firing him or not is irrelevant you sound like you want revenge for your son that's understandable but totally inappropriate and is a waste of your energy you tried to make it sound like you are more concerned for the other employees the ones with families to support they too can look out for themselves they can quit and get other jobs or they can move to a state that does allow unions where they can make all the demands they want to forcing their employers run their business the way they think it should be run there are laws to protect employees but i haven't heard you describe a single illegal act aside from the sexually harassed secretary being dismissed and she can hire an attorney sue the company and retire comfortably if this is the case again it's not your problem or responsibility  Plame affair Theory of conduct Friends Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Divorce Poker jargon 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Microeconomics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Internet fraud Fathers' rights Unemployment Citigroup Credit card Wal-Mart Shaggy dog story Capitalism Insurance Life insurance Privatization Trade union Appeal Gender-neutral language Rick Santorum Judicial review Tax Social rule Apple Computer Enron Corporation Lawyer Domestic violence Milton H.

what do you believe are unethical banking practices i believe it is wrong for a bank to automatically withdraw funds from a person's account for a transaction but then wait days for a deposit on ths person's account to clear before usage of such funds can occur does this practice seem a bit unbalanced what other banking practices do you think are unfair some of the overdraft fees and low balance fees are rediculously high for example my friend says he had a low balance fee gimme a break i'm not even earning that much interest in one year they take it out when your balance drops and for each month it remains under the minimum balance but honestly if you keep enough money in your account you should be fine also all you have to do is read the account agreement or you can call customer service and just ask them it is boring but you should be able to find out what you need to know if however something isn't mentioned in that book or by the call center rep then yes that policy or fee is unethical  Bank Credit card Mutual fund Automatic teller machine Annuity Monetary policy Insurance Citigroup Short selling Keynesian economics Ethics Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Octopus card Student loan Internet fraud Islamic banking Economy of India Mortgage Variable universal life insurance Hedge fund Bank of China (Hong Kong) Corporate finance Schabir Shaik Trial Certificate of deposit Bretton Woods system Say's law Leasing Enron Corporation Poker jargon MMORPG Taxation in the United States Economy of Russia Gold standard EFTPOS Advance fee fraud Investment bank Social Security debate (United States) Password Graduate school Neopets FairTax Bank fraud Credit card fraud Comorian franc SmartRider Mergers and acquisitions Business ethics Bond Euro Salary cap Theory of conduct Trust (Law) USA Call centre Divorce Economy of Nigeria Contract Derivative (finance) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Economy of Iceland Balance of payments Life insurance Finance Monetary and fiscal policy of Japan Gold as an investment Eliot Spitzer Microeconomics Cheque Creative accounting Predatory lending Asian financial crisis Double-entry book-keeping Deflation (economics) SCO-Linux controversies Coutts Primerica Financial Services Wells Fargo Offshore bank Fractional-reserve banking World Bank Group Toronto-Dominion Bank Lloyd's of London New Deal Financial services Wal-Mart Financial audit Stock Privatization Microcredit Corporate governance Arbitrage CPU cache Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Gross domestic product Hong Kong Monetary Authority Central bank President's Choice Financial Futures contract

how do you make a mirror how do people make mirrors in factories or other buildings a mirror is essentially a sheet of glass back coated with aluminium tain as you already know aluminium and pretty any metal is highly reflective the problem is that the surface is usually to rough or tarnished to reflect a proper picture aluminium foil for example generated a passable reflection but as it gets more wrinkled the reflection becomes more an more distorted until it gets a point that a reflection is entirely unrecognizable it is possible to flatten and polish aluminium or other metals to point that they would reflect perfectly this is how mirrors were often made in the past without glass the problem is that metal is expensive to flatten and shine and then the shine is difficult to maintain metal is quite heavy as well it's much easier to produce a perflectly flat and smooth surface of glass once the metal is applied to the glass it becomes and remains flat and smooth you can replicate this in a lab by placing a piece of glass on some mercury don't forget that mercury is toxic though  Aluminium Mirror Glass Casting Amateur telescope making Welding Optical coating Microphone Drill bit Solar cell Nuclear weapon design Sunglasses Drawing Gas metal arc welding Tin Plastic Laser Float glass Ultraviolet Loudspeaker Silver Stereoscopy Corrosion Boat building Cookware and bakeware Friction Mercury (element) Mars Exploration Rover Inertial confinement fusion Sand casting Gramophone record Vacuum tube Lathe Manifold Diamond simulant Eyepiece Lapping Pearl Laserdisc Diamond cut Diamond enhancement Mylar Stained glass Sewage treatment Powder metallurgy Mouse (computing) Point groups in three dimensions Terminal ballistics Screw Brazing View camera Waste management Hydrogen Chromium Gilding Beryllium Laser engraving Electrophysiology Pottery Arc welding Mithril Vitreous enamel Fluorescent lamp Aberration in optical systems Crown glass Manicure Computer representation of surfaces Mattress Radar cross section Sandpaper Solar system Printed circuit board Transistor Cross-country skiing Indium Action potential Textile manufacturing terminology Telescope Caesium Glasses Sheet metal Table tennis Technicolor Microwave oven Violin Mercury 4 Titan (moon) Plane (tool) Sterling silver Bong Motorcycle Hubble Space Telescope Gold Compact disc Radio controlled airplane Fast bowling Sulfuric acid

accounting finance merger acquisition does anyone know any of the following questions what potential synergies exist in mergers acquisitions what might be the potential challenges what ways does the buyer or seller add protection against downside risk to the agreement the potential synergies will be very dependent on the specific companies that are merging often times they're related to economies of scale redundancies and value adding combinations of products or services for example they may be able to shift production capacity between the companies to minimize fixed costs or they may be able to eliminate staff that do the same jobs in each of the companies there may be accounting efficiencies as well one company may have losses that can be used to offset taxes owed on the other company's gains the challenges will also depend on the particular companies but generally involve integrating the individual operations into a uniform single company often times the cultures of the two workplaces are different which can lead to friction it also will take time for the two companies to learn each other's capabilities strengths and weaknesses management in the two companies may have very different ideas about the best strategy for the combined company which can lead to a decreased ability to execute or to adjust to industry pressures often times two firms that are in talks to merge will enter into financial agreements that motivate the two parties to make the deal successful if one firm pulls out of the negotiation they sometimes have to pay a fee to the other company this mitigates the risk of a losses time money resources management effort from a failed negotiation good luck  Microeconomics Capitalism Supply and demand Strategic management Insurance Inflation Free trade Contract Bank Monopoly Tax Citigroup Risk management Corporate finance Synergy Unemployment Mutual fund FairTax Venture capital Mortgage Economy of the United States Corporation Wealth Capital accumulation Economics Management information system Natural monopoly Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Short selling Japan-United States relations Commodity markets Derivative (finance) Welding Hedge fund Surplus value Monetary policy Gold standard Marketing Labor theory of value Stock Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Information Services Procurement Library Microsoft Price discrimination Keynesian economics Bretton Woods system Market dominance strategies United Kingdom corporation tax Corporate governance History of the United States (1918-1945) New Deal Nuclear power Education in the People's Republic of China Morgan Stanley Final Fantasy XI Experience curve effects Tariff Economic relations of Japan Marketing warfare strategies Investment bank Pharmaceutical company Inventory Opportunity cost Islamic banking PricewaterhouseCoopers Wind power MG Rover Group Trademark Compiler optimization Arbitrage Life insurance Criticisms of socialism Economy of India Intellectual property Light pollution Globalization Economy of Belgium Enron Corporation Productive and unproductive labour Credit card Economy of Russia Value added tax Hybrid vehicle Relationship marketing Bond Cable television Illegal drug trade

verbal write up today at work the manager said tomorrow i will get a verbal write up i'm just wondering what a verbal write up is she said that's worse than a regular write up can someone explain what i might be getting into thanks for those replying see i'm a cashier and i've gotten plenty of writes ups do to missing money or being over too much it happens well i've gotten a bunch and the last one i got a month ago was a big write up that stated that if i were to get one more i would be suspended and after that fired well today i was missing bucks because this customer played me i'm very pissed off i said just give me a write up and the manager said oh it's gonna be more than that it will be a verbal write up well i hope its suspension and if so i'll ask if i can switch positions but dollars that may lead to firing i don't want that well she has it backwards a written warning is worse then a verbal write up a verbal warning write up is designed to show that you were warned about an unacceptable behavior but no further actions will be taken unless you continue not to conform this form of write up is used solely for documentation to show that someone talked to you the first time you are late for work would be a good example of what might warrant a verbal warning a written warning documents a specific event that outwardly defied company policy which could get you terminated on the spot for example yelling at another employee which is a form of work place violence being late for work a second time within a short period of time or theft  Poker jargon Contract Wal-Mart Paintball Plame affair World Wrestling Entertainment Social rule Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Amazing Race Scientology beliefs and practices English grammar Domestic violence Ocean's Twelve Saturday Night Live Milton H.

how do you motivate a co worker to work faster and more efficiently my boss gave our receptionist a very simple project input the contact info of about or so clients it's been two months now and the work isn't done yet i asked my co worker what's taking her so long to finish it and she gave me this dirty look she said that she's distracted from the phones all the time i'm thinking to myself regardless of how distracted you get all you have to do is type a client's name address phone and e mail it shouldn't take weeks to finish it motivation comes from within so you can't motivate anyone what you can do is provide an environment that encourages people to strive for success however in this case i'm not sure motivation is the issue what i'm reading into your message is perhaps a bit of jealousy you work hard but your friend doesn't and it looks to me like you're attempting to elevate your status from that of a co worker to that of a 'wannabe' supervisor if you need the information your co worker hasn't completed why not offer to help have you ever worked as a receptionist perhaps the expression 'walk a mile in my shoes' may be worth heeding  BitTorrent Plame affair E-mail Social rule Extreme Programming Gmail Friends Domain Name System Cross site scripting Surveillance City of Heroes Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Computer CPU cache X Window System E-mail spam Password Graduate school Requirements analysis Instant messaging Principal-agent problem Spam (electronic) Surplus value Enterprise content management Master Control Program BlackBerry Milton H.

can i call usps to track my order i ordered something from san diego i live hours from san diego i ordered my item like days ago i figured it would've been here by now how long more do i have to wait when i enter my tracking number it says there's no info on my item can i call them i was in a similar situation a few months ago and i can tell you that calling the usps directly is useless they can't give you anymore information than is on the website the only thing they will tell you is to wait a certain period of time and if you still haven't received your package to file a claim you're probably better off contacting the sender and finding out when if the item was actually shipped since a tracking number can be obtained before the item is physically mailed  Internet fraud Domain Name System Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Mail fraud Data retention Gmail USS Terry (DD-513) Getting Things Done ZIP Code USS Volador (SS-490) FidoNet Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Post office USS Sea Devil (SS-400) E-mail USS Whale (SS-239) USS Wilkes (DD-441) USS Ticonderoga (CV-14) Information Mouse (computing) USS William B.

how much do companies usually pay in dividens is it alot or very little i just need to know because i'm trying to figure out how much because i want to know how much its worth it and how it can help you with income no one seems to be giving a price idea is it between dollars or less just a rough guess here but typically to of the stock price there are exceptions with some industries paying up to or so but the amount varies you can't count on per year but will get this is some years in others years maybe alot less but these are special cases like closed ended funds and reits look this up if you aren't sure what i'm talking about also for my money this is a lousy way to get paid the dividends are taxed as profit by the company and taxed on you by the irs so essentially they are taxed twice sure the money only comes out of your pocket once but the extra tax still reduces what the company pays out so it does still hurt you  Mutual fund Dividend Tax Taxation in the United States Income trust Microeconomics Insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Warren Buffett Progressive tax Bond 401(k) Corporation PE ratio Inflation Corporate finance Income Hyperinflation Annuity Trust (Law) USA Health insurance Employee stock option FairTax Capital accumulation Capital gains tax Capitalism Publicly funded medicine Tax avoidance/evasion Keynesian economics Supply-side economics Lloyd's of London Economy of Russia Stock Variable universal life insurance Wal-Mart Deflation (economics) Short selling Money Illegal drug trade Credit card NASDAQ Donald Trump Enron Corporation Gold as an investment Sears Holdings Corporation Supply and demand Mikhail Khodorkovsky Public good Economic rent U.S. public debt Education in the United States Minimum wage Retirement plan Dividend imputation Mergers and acquisitions Non-profit organization Cost of capital Guaranteed minimum income Social Security debate (United States) Tariff Income tax Betting (poker) Privatization Monopoly (game) Bank Value added tax Gross domestic product Monetary policy Temasek Holdings Hedge fund American International Group Social Security (United States) Life insurance Gold standard Blackjack Price discrimination One.Tel Canadian and American economies compared Preferred stock Earned income tax credit Investment bank Stock market Federal Reserve Labor theory of value National Insurance Tax bracket Arbitrage Tax protester Rational pricing Surplus value Ponzi scheme Wheel of Fortune Arthur Laffer Software patent debate U.S. Internal Revenue Service Limited liability company Wealth condensation Tax resistance

is there much fraud involved with electronic checks i am being offered an e check as payment for a vehicle i know it can be verified before product is delivered but is the fraudulent risk worth paying the or so for the proper paper hard to tell if you are a business or an individual who is offering the e check a business or an individual and what kind of arrangment you are really looking at but overall the process cuts down on fraud electronic checking legitimate is a service offered to businesses by check processing companies the like where a paper check presented by a consumer is converted to electronic format it's scanned and translated into a banking file the banking file can be processed by computers faster than paper checks by people and the conversion software can keep track of and reject accounts and ids used in fraud the service must be subscribed to by the business not the consumer so the business would offer to accept your check electronically not pay you it's different than eft electronic funds transfer like direct deposit which is how businesses would typically pay electronically but they would need your banking info to do it so most companies issue paper checks for payments two things do concern me a business that takes checks electronically has a device to do the conversion similar to a credit card machine you do not so how will you handle the e check with a paper check which any business converting check to electronic files will still have you get a signature along with acount number name address phone etc what will this e check give you just an account i would call my bank and ask them about the arrangement and the e check business not the person paying you but who they want to pay through also ask the person paying you what they need from you to do this e check there are scams where individuals gather banking information so they can later rob people  Internet fraud Credit card Mail fraud Advance fee fraud Enterprise content management Electronic money Credit card fraud Surveillance Identity theft RFID Octopus card Security (finance) United States Postal Service Medical prescription E-mail spam CPU cache Password Computer Spyware Phishing Tax British national identity card Cheque Telephone exchange Public transport Credit repair 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Money Musical Instrument Digital Interface Fraud Insurance Spam (electronic) Annuity E-mail 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Bluetooth Gmail Financial services Bank of China (Hong Kong) Open access Phone fraud Bond Digital photography Windows 2000 XML Slot machine Citigroup Capital accumulation Digital rights management Digital circuit Computer insecurity Investment bank Online shop Information Technology Infrastructure Library Mutual fund Computer virus Xerox Money supply Embedded system Personal finance Commodity markets C programming language TransUnion Best Buy Database Stopping e-mail abuse Reverse engineering Finance Redundant array of independent disks Mach kernel Confidence trick Privatization Sound recording Windows XP Road-rule enforcement camera Pyramid scheme Digital signature Peer review Universal Serial Bus Smart card Mail Data retention File Allocation Table Copyleft Life insurance Killian documents 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Software patent debate Trusted computing Voice over IP

what does the federal reserve adding liquidity to the market mean and how does it help see yahoo news article http news yahoo com s nm bs nm usa markets fedops dc also interested in understanding any impacts that it has to other world markets interest rates and inflation an in depth answer will be rather lengthy so i'll just give you the basics when the fed adds liquidity to the system they are really adding more money they do this by buying t bills the federal reserve basically has an infinite account in order to buy these t bills when they buy the t bills the money for the purchase is credited to the bank accounts of the dealers since those banks can loan money based upon the total amount of money deposited with them they then have more available money to loan with more money available to loan this creates downward pressure on interest rates and eases the ability of individuals and businesses to obtain credit the fed has to be careful though they can't just add an infinite amount of money to the economy too much money added and the value of the dollar drops and inflation goes up it is even possible to devalue the dollar completely and have inflation in the hundreds or thousands of percent however a modest amount of monetary increase with a small inflation rate allows the economy to grow while not eroding purchasing power too much they can remove money from the system in much the same way they will simply sell some of the t bills they bought earlier and that in effect removes money from circulation  Inflation Deflation (economics) Gold standard Bretton Woods system Money Hyperinflation Pound sterling Asian financial crisis Bank Federal Reserve Bond Interest Supply-side economics Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Euro Fiat money Capital accumulation Economy of the United States Monetarism Surplus value Mortgage Central bank Microeconomics Gross domestic product FairTax United States dollar Debt Credit card U.S. public debt Keynesian economics Deficit spending Government debt Fractional-reserve banking Economy of Pakistan Arthur Laffer Privatization Money creation New Deal Gold as an investment Taxation in the United States Foreign exchange market International Monetary Fund Reaganomics Wealth Social Credit Free trade Citigroup Economy of Ghana Mergers and acquisitions Insurance Economics Economy of India Anarchism and capitalism Say's law Money market Tariff Economy of Romania Tax Economy of El Salvador Supply and demand Economic history of the United States Capitalism Economy of Brazil 1973 oil crisis Economy of Chile Marshall Plan Economic relations of Japan MMORPG Exchange rate Canadian and American economies compared Economy of Zimbabwe Primerica Financial Services Security (finance) Hong Kong dollar Economy of Nigeria Corporation Personal finance Student loan Savings and loan association Investment bank Economic history of Spain Banknote Bank fraud Derivative (finance) Currency Predatory lending

debit what comes in credit what goes out debit the receiver credit the giver debit all expenses and losses can anybody help me to understand these principles sure i am an accountant so hopefully this will help you are talking about two different issues assets liabilities and revenues expenses anytime you increase an asset you make a debit entry to that asset for example if a company receives a payment they increase or debit the cash account likewise if a company spends money they would credit cash to decrease it many times the offset of increasing or decreasing a liability is on the revenue expense side in the example above when a company spends money they will credit a cash account and record the offsetting debit to an expense account the easiest way to remember is that in simplistic cash accounting if you increase cash and debit it then the offset credit must be to a revenue account if you decrease cash and credit it the offsetting debit must go to an expense account debits increase an asset increase expenses credits increase liabilities increase revenues this is the simplest example there is accounting is entirely more detailed than this so look at a financial accounting textbook for additional help also there are several resources on the web if you search for financial accounting help  Credit card Bank Personal finance Microeconomics United Kingdom corporation tax Finance Corporate finance Insurance Tax Accounting methods Mergers and acquisitions Government debt Financial services Financial statements Bond Accountancy Deflation (economics) Money supply Depreciation FairTax Financial audit Surveillance Mutual fund Income statement U.S. generally accepted accounting principles Debit card Bank fraud Monetary policy Debt Dividend PE ratio Life insurance Social Security (United States) Internet fraud Warner Music Group Credit card fraud Money Hyperinflation Economy of India Taxation in the United States Economy of Russia Automated Clearing House Citigroup Income trust Arthur Laffer Collateralized debt obligation Derivative (finance) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Capital accumulation Gross domestic product 401(k) Corporation Model (economics) Privatization SmartRider Toll road Asset management Reaganomics EFTPOS Capitalism Gold standard Pension Economy of El Salvador Margin (finance) Inflation Cheque Opportunity cost IAS 36: Impairment of Assets Inventory Divorce Stock Arbitrage Mortgage Interac Payroll Federal National Mortgage Association Universal life insurance Television licence Enron Corporation U.S. public debt Variable universal life insurance E-gold Security (finance) Annuity Automatic teller machine Individual Savings Account Manitoba Hydro Keynesian economics Futures contract MetroCard Fractional-reserve banking Small business Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Primerica Financial Services

how to send a money order okay im ordering e l f makeup from eyeslipsface com and paying with a money order and i was wondering who do i make the money order out to and i know i can go to the currency exchange to get money orders but do they send it out or can they give it to me and i can send it out if they send it out then do i have to give them my order form for the makeup i've never ever send a money order so i don't know how this work so can anyone please explain this to me i was also wondering how much it would cost if the money order was about dollars please and thank you well i will start with the last part of this question first based on what we have here in ohio about the cost of money orders when you get the money order not only do you hand the clerk the dollars to cover the money order but the processing fee as well usually cent to dollar as the processing fee depening on store where the money order is issued at and company the money order is drawn on like moneygram or western union the list goes on and on as to companies who issue money orders what they do after that is print up a check looking item which you make out to the company listed on eyeslipface com's website as to who to make it out to the money order itself will have a perforated edge along the bottom border and you tear off that perforation because what is actualy between them is a small flimsy layer of a carbon paper like material you keep this and the bottom copy as your reciept also that way if the company does not mail out your products through the postal mail or a delivery service like fed ex depending on who they use because they did not get payment you can put what is called a tracer on the money order which will track down where the money order is who has it and if it was cashed who endorsed it to get the money for it what happens next after you make it out is put it into a mail envelope with a stamp on it and put the money order's top copy in it with a printed out copy of the order form and drop it in your local postal mail drop box meaning a mailbox for the mail carrier to pick up or a post office mailbox somewhere nearby after that you put the copy you kept when you made out the money order and wait on delivery of the makeup oh you include a printed out copy of the order form so the company knows what you ordered to send you otherwise you will never get your makeup as they will just think you are sending them money without knowing what you ordered and will probly not deliver your makeup oh and also print another copy of your makeup order form also for your records untill the makeup is delivered that way if something gets goofed up which it sometimes does you have proof of what you ordered and payment you got and mailed them so you still have a chance of getting your makeup that you ordered but that is just good common sense because goofs do happen occaisionally and if ordering something from anywhere it's always best to keep all records of what was ordered how much it was and things like that till the item is directly in your hands or delivered to your home or wherever you are having it delivered to so that if a goof does happen you can still have a chance of getting what you ordered and paid for hope that helped  Postage stamp Mail fraud Post office Postage stamps and postal history of the United States Internet fraud Direct marketing E-mail Surveillance United States dollar Hyperinflation Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Royal Mail Money Currency Credit card E-mail spam Envelope Make money fast Poker jargon Stamp collecting Mac OS X Gold standard Apple Open Collaboration Environment Inflation Banknote Short selling Deflation (economics) Philatelic literature Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Monetary policy Insurance GSM services Domain Name System Security (finance) Private Express Statutes Open access Wal-Mart FairTax Public-key cryptography Mail art Bond Spam (electronic) Euro Gross domestic product Microeconomics Money supply Public domain Liberty Dollar Compendium of postage stamp issuers (Brit - British) United Parcel Service Screenplay Postmark Animal Crossing Cable television Postcode Automatic teller machine Xerox Flat tax Royal Assent Commodity markets Canada Health Act Monopoly (game) Fiat money Compendium of postage stamp issuers (Ce - Ch) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Postal authority Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Newspaper Casting Gramophone record SCO-Linux controversies Bank fraud Legal research Let's Make a Deal Arbitrage Solar cell Online shop Penny Black Notary public Copyright 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Government debt Enterprise content management Canadian dollar Charles Ponzi Taxation in the United States Compendium of postage stamp issuers (Ma - Md) Tax

whats the average income for somone who never graduated college i never graduated and i only make a year with bonuses about a year i have friends that have their bachelors degrees that cannot get jobs it seems like even a bachelors doesnt really do it anymore i'm reading alot of people getting masters degrees to get jobs what is minimum wage looking like im yrs old and live in the northeast region ugh i got a masters of public administration but government and non profit will underpay you until you have a lot of years under your belt unless you have some major support behind you from someone with power and influence a lot of jobs will require a few years experience and will underpay you for a year or two as part of a training program took me years after getting my degree just to make it to k but once i get enough experience in i can move to the front of the line for some bigger and better positions and then your salary can really take off i'm interviewing for a budget analyst job that's k and i could advance to over k after years if i'm promoted so basically the degree gives you the potential to earn a lot of money and it gives you the chance to get jobs that could lead to much higher salaries but you still have to start at the bottom usually and it can be a slow road people without degrees can still make decent money and they often make more than their college grad counterparts in their mid to late s because they simply have more years of work experience in but then you get into the s and that's when the successful college grads surpass the non grads because they're eligible for those professional managerial and executive jobs that the non grads are not eligible for but the college grad can't just jump right into one of those jobs right out of school of course they need to work their way up just like everyone else and prove their worth that is why you might notice you're making more than some college folks in career terms it makes a lot more sense to get a degree later in life after you're established in a company number one you know exactly what you're shooting for number two you'll already have your experience in so you can see immediate returns and number three the company may help you pay for it but people tend not to do this because college is easier when you don't have a house and kids and a full time job and you can spend all day just going to classes and doing homework in reality a lot of people spend all day goofing off and those are the people who don't see the benefits of the degree right away if ever going to school does not develop your career working does some fields are tied in directly with college such as science medicine engineering etc but you still don't earn the money until you put in some work either as an intern or what have you the people who really do take off are the ones who are working on their careers while attending college and are taking classes directly related to what they're doing and who have a specific and attainable goal in mind that necessitates that college degree if you go to college for the sake of going to college the degree is not going to be worth much you're obviously way above minimum wage so that doesn't affect you but you may reach a point where your salary is capped and you can't go any further without the degree if you know that will end up being the case it might be a good idea to start working on that degree so that you can break through that barrier  Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Professor Constitution of the

explain the difference between price earnings multiples and cash flow multiples it is different in two key ways one is accounting basis and the other is levered versus levered paradigm first accounting basis accounting is done on accrual basis while cash flow is done on cash basis in the accrual basis you account for revenues when they are earned not when cash is received and match expenses to revenues even if no cash goes out the door e g you accrue wages payable for paying your employees every day that they work not just a big lump sum when you pay them pe is often seen as a good ratio for normalized earnings while cash flow multiples are seen as a reality check to make sure that the company actually generates cash rather than have it flow elsewhere via accruals or only come via non cash sources as warren buffet says cash flow is king second leverage paradigm this is my fancy way of saying you are looking at how it looks to owners versus all financing sources not just equity holders this is important because sometimes earnings to equity holders can be different simply based on how the company is financed for example companies are often looked on ev ebitda ratios unlevered company divided by how much cash flows to see how much the entity is worth vis a vis its pre financing and pre tax cash flows this method takes into account the balance sheet and cash flows rather than just looking at equity earnings and earnings that may or may not have cash to back it up  Accounting methods Corporate finance Microeconomics EBITDA Tax Bond Life insurance Mutual fund Pension Double-entry book-keeping Annuity United Kingdom corporation tax Mergers and acquisitions Debt Finance Insurance Income statement Compensation of employees Derivative (finance) PE ratio Deflation (economics) Stock Credit card Margin (finance) Social Security (United States) Capital accumulation Personal finance FairTax Security (finance) Cash flow statement Financial audit Inflation Gold standard Income Collateralized debt obligation Valuation (finance) U.S. generally accepted accounting principles Warren Buffett Surplus value Asset Institutional fund management Retirement plan Liability U.S. public debt Social Security debate (United States) Berkshire Hathaway Income trust Monetary policy Treasury security 401(k) Federal National Mortgage Association Supply-side economics Cost of capital Mortgage Flat tax Employee stock option Productive and unproductive labour National Insurance Profit Ford Motor Company Leverage (finance) Risk management Futures contract Economics Labour economics Trust (Law) USA Gross domestic product Google Bank Management information system Investment bank Value added tax Keynesian economics Dividend Poker jargon Debt levels and flows Money supply Payroll Financial markets Enron Corporation Cheque Taxation in the United States Free trade Financial statements Airline Model (economics) Economy of India Leveraged buyout Primerica Financial Services Economy of Russia Municipal bond Weighted average cost of capital Financial services Database

anyone find it odd that the u s unemployment rate is at almost all the time o k today i get the report that the unemployment rate has reached percent but for the most part of this year and last year the unemployment rate has been at i mean for every single month it was percent do you think they way they are calculating these numbers are suspect it hasn't reached or it is almost always well the economy added jobs for the month of july and i don't think that is good news that is mighty weak how can the economy be in such great shape when it has added such weak numbers doesn't make sense who was it that said lies damn lies and statistics unemployment is a government manufactured statistic that undergoes mucho manipulation first the dol estimates that some percentage of americans is always out of work or chronically unemployed so they're not counted at all second unemployment insurance runs out after months so people who continue to search for jobs or give up looking for jobs are not counted as unemployed finally we count americans currently drawing benefits vs those jobs added the ones dropping off prior to months come up with some reasonable number and go with it some years back i believe it was greenspan who said the unemployment rate for a healthy economy should be at least so the workforce stays nicely pliable some people thought that was rather draconian so in recent years the statistic conveniently stays under to answer your question yes the number is a load of s  Unemployment Labour economics Social Security (United States) Unemployment benefit Economy of the United States Gross domestic product Inflation Economic inequality Capitalism Economy of Russia Economy of Fiji Wal-Mart Reaganomics Doomsday argument George W.

prices of goods in charity shops it seems to me that some charity shops are overpricing some of the stuff thy have on sale i can buy stuff brand new for less than they are asking on the tag yes i appreciate tht they need to get the best price tht they can but surely by lowering the prices to a more realistic level the shop would turn the goods over faster and therefore make more money for the charity concerned anyone else agree this relates to shops in the uk not sure about anywhere else when charity shpos first started all the good they sold were a bargain but they became to popular and the result is the ridiculous prices they now charge but orginally they started out as small shops run by local volunteers but have no been swallowed up by some form of corperate marketing and most have large exspensive offices paying stupid wage to managers to run the bloody things i cannot be sure but i believe some of the managers are on upwards of per year with all the perks thrown in as well the sooner the shops get back to grass roots the better it will be for all i am all for raising money for charity but let the charity be run by volunteers in some charity shops the money raised for charity is less than the wages paid out this is wrong i for one say get back to the old days  Microeconomics Capitalism Supply and demand Anarchism and capitalism Short selling Wal-Mart Surplus value Hyperinflation Tax Retailer Price discrimination $ale of the Century Inflation Monetary policy Labour economics Gold standard Mutual fund The Apprentice 2 Rational expectations Bulk vending Labor-power MMORPG Keynesian economics Economy of Russia Monopoly Theory of the firm Gross domestic product Taxation in the United States Tariff Progressive tax Commodity Economics Contract Labor theory of value Law of value Charity shop Say's law Supply-side economics Trade union Internet fraud RuneScape economy Electronic commerce Credit card PE ratio Newcastle United F.C.

what are the channels of distribution of perdue farms inc perdue farms inc has been a privately held family owned company since over the years perdue has become vertically integrated in order to be more competitive and maintain financial stability perdue s objective is to be the leader in broiler and related poultry products in the industry they strive to maintain quality and constantly improve efficiency and service both today and in the future perdue farms inc has a mission to provide the highest quality poultry and poultry related products to retail and food service customers they want to be the recognized industry leader in quality and service providing more than expected from their customers associates and owners they will accomplish this by maintaining a tradition of pride in their products growth through innovation integrity in the management of their business and commitment to team management and the quality improvement process perdue s overall mission is strong but a strategy for long term growth and market development needs to be reviewed and evaluated perdue farms inc has numerous external opportunities and threats the external opportunities that effect perdue are as follows to broadly diversify and have greater market share domestically and internationally to increase marketing of healthy image products that envelops a strong niche market to ship via plane to maintain fresh not frozen broilers and increase market share and penetration develop new markets in the upper mid west to increase market share increase sales of food service chicken and turkey from of overall sales to due to a strong growth rate to expand the international grain and oilseed market with an increase push on health in chicken sales are up over red meat sales average annual consumption of chicken is up to lbs person year an all time high the external threats are as follows most of the competition sells frozen products for less money perdue s cost to raise chickens is above the national average growth rate in chicken sales is only due to lack of frozen line over capacity of chickens has reduced wholesale prices which reduces profit margins competition is strong in broiler industry with competitors untapped markets in the upper mid west need to be explored the perdue farms co has internal strengths and weaknesses that need to be addressed and evaluated the strengths are as follows perdue is vertically integrated which means that they produce the chickens they breed hatch the eggs they select the growers build perdue chicken houses formulate and manufacture their feed oversee care and feeding operate their own processing plants distribute via truck and marketing they now also sell what used to be waste such as the chicken feet that is sold to the orient as a delicacy privately held firm technologically advanced ex more breast meat than the competition birds are fed organically and not feed additives sell both raw and pre cooked chickens and turkeys good compensation package to the workers non union company mis efficient and essential to operating the business good variety from fresh oven stuffer roasters cooked prepared foods cutlets tenders fit n easy and much more good tqm with mission and vision excellent r d for better meat to bone ratios keep overhead low quality up great diverse product line that has changed with consumer changes horizontal diversification when they bought showell farms which made them the third largest producer in the broiler industry great social responsibility code of ethics environmentally concerned about waste and prevention strong effective marketing the weaknesses in the perdue farm inc case are as follows they only sell fresh not frozen chickens deliveries are only made by truck so the radius to overnight chickens is limited lack of long term planning for future changes i would suggest a strategy that perdue would focus on maintaining their quality and efficiency along with plans for extensive market development i would like to see them expand into the upper mid west before other markets gain strong holds and market share if perdue plans on maintaining their place in the market they need to expand and continue to diversify their products to attract niche markets and stay ahead of the competition according to porter s generic strategies he points out that in order to gain the competitive advantage companies need to draw from three bases cost leadership differentiation and focus in my study of perdue i feel that they are a differentiation and focus orientated company first i see perdue as a leader in quality and efficiency but not a cost leader cost leadership implies that you strive to be the low cost producer in your particular industry this is to the contrary for perdue they have marketed in a way to make the consumer pay a little more for a better product in fact this did not happen by accident perdue did not want to be known as the cheapest but to be the best quality for the consumer at a fair price what perdue does take from cost leadership is that they are highly efficient low overhead their intolerance to waste broad span of control rewards linked to efficiency and cost cutting measures and open lines of communication between workers and upper management perdue s successful strategy of horizontal integration to gain competitive advantage was to purchase showell farms which made perdue the third largest broiler company in the united states i see perdue as being highly successful with differentiation which implies that they produce products and services that are considered unique industry wide and directed at consumers who are relatively price in sensitive perdue has ongoing product development which states that they seek to increase sales by improving or modifying present products or services perdue has been an industry leader with constant attention paid to consumer wants and needs they watch trends such as fitness and weight consciousness by introducing the fit n easy line that markets skinless and boneless chicken parts with nutritional information and recipes perdue also followed the trend of the working family and began to market prepared foods which has done extremely well prepared foods such as pre cooked chickens turkeys parts nuggets and the like sell easily to working families finally i see perdue s strongest strategy according to porter is focus perdue has wonderful r d that constantly follows market trends and changes that will be beneficial to their growth perdue has never forgotten where they came from and this is what makes them strong focus allows them to change with the times and not become over diversified where they overlook their cash cows and forget to nurture their stars perdue knows that quality and efficiency are at the heart of their operation and do not stray from that their innovation and integrity to be the leader has brought them customer loyalty and appreciation for quality where price is not the number one factor perdue s ability to focus on strong team management has allowed them to penetrate and develop new markets with ease perdue has a high penetration of advertising on tv and print along with opening up new territories to further expand their market share their vision has been a good guide and has led them to a very successful value chain perdue s attention to detail in every aspect of the business has been proven successful and the financial status of the company reflects it today perdue is further expanding with new acquisitions and product lines their innovative thinking and drive to be the leader shows in all they do in they started marketing their caf perdue line and have seen slow with steady success perdue s prepared foods are selling incredibly well with the american family on the run as of september perdue made a new acquisition toward horizontal integration with gol pak a competitor in the foodservice and prepared foods business the new relationship will further enhance perdue s prepared food and foodservice business gol pak specialized in the development and production of products primarily for the foodservice industry with a list including the top chain restaurants perdue sees this as a significant purchase to enhance their reputation and make them strong contenders in the prepared food and foodservice industry ceo jim perdue feels that they are well positioned in the market place and continued growth along with r d will help them to maintain quality and efficiency along with strong market penetration and market share did you really think anyone here would take the time to read all that to answer what's obviously a homework problem

why don't accounting departments like it when you use your purchasing card for travel expenses some companies offer a separate purchasing card and t e card if you don't have a t e card they want you to use your personal purchasing card for travel expenses and they will reimburse you after the trip what is the logic behind this why do they not want you to use the purchasing card for your travel expenses directly related to work it creates a lot of work for the accounting department to sort out the charges and expense them to the correct accounts it also allows them to keep your travel expenses under control some people would go crazy with a purchasing card with a high limit but would not make the same purchases with their own card i have also seen companies that restrict their cards to certain merchants types of purchases for example a purchasing card can be set up so that purchases at a clothing store or restaurant will automatically be denied at the register i would hate to have to use my personal card for work related travel expenses and hope they reimburse me if you are carrying a balance on your personal card you will end up paying interest on the work purchases while you wait for them to reimburse you i'd push them to issue you a travel card if they are requiring you to travel for work  Credit card Octopus card Insurance Bank Publicly funded medicine Value added tax Automatic teller machine Student loan Mutual fund Surveillance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Debit card Internet fraud Oyster card Transport in Hong Kong CPU design Life insurance Passport Compensation of employees 401(k) Security (finance) Teletext Sears Holdings Corporation Corporation Identity document Public policy United States Postal Service Citigroup Bulk vending Web hosting Poker jargon Neopets Annuity SmartRider Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Credit card fraud Digital photography Wal-Mart Supply and demand Animal Crossing MetroCard Mergers and acquisitions Blackjack Identity theft MAME Child support Legal tender Punch card Auto insurance Estoppel The Amazing Race Community card poker EFTPOS Loyalty program Magic: The Gathering British national identity card Atari 8-bit family Price discrimination Plame affair Electronic toll collection Health savings account Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission RFID PE ratio Copy protection Computer Tom DeLay Taxicab Yu-Gi-Oh!

how to ship a whitetail deer bust taxidermy from colorado to california what is the most efficient method i am not sure of the measurements but it is approximately lbs i am just beginning to collect taxidermy pieces and i have no clue as to how these shipments work i would assume i'd need to place insurance on it and ship it with packaging foam peanuts and fragile labels etc thanks for any help you can provide don't ship fedex they do not offer insurance on ground packages they ask you the value of the package and charge you extra if the value is over but they do not offer insurance google fedex insurance and you'll see a lot of complaints from people who found out the hard way that they don't insure packages if the overall box size is less than girth height you can ship it ups and insure it dhl is cheaper than ups but tend to cause more damage from my experience the only other option is greyhound which is super cheap but they will have to pick up at the greyhound station for a deer i would wrap the antlers with bubble wrap and then wrap the entire thing with foam king size foam mattress pads are great and cheap packing material and then fill any voids in the box with the packing peanuts i wouldn't use just packing peanuts  Mattress United States Postal Service United Parcel Service Plastic Strap-on dildo Insurance Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) Shipping Upholstery Bed (furniture) Floppy disk Explosive material Brewery Health insurance Butter Bulk vending Computer Internet fraud Sand casting Solar cell Collecting fossils Peanuts Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Polyurethane Radio controlled airplane PlayStation Portable Cardboard Microeconomics Mail Auto insurance Gradius Seismic retrofit Peanut butter Dodge Charger Xbox 360 Loudspeaker Taxicab Tesco Casting Christo and Jeanne-Claude Jute Life insurance Contract STS-114 Peanut PC Engine Soap bubble Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Brassiere Objective-C Light-emitting diode Naval mine Star Trek Customizable Card Game Bread Bubble wrap Polystyrene Bubble Bobble Laptop Bong Nuclear weapon design Unreal Gambling Tobacco smoking Illegal drug trade Wal-Mart Model aircraft Redundant array of independent disks Topps Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited Laser engraving Wind power Teller-Ulam design IBM PC compatible Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Cocaine Copyright Unemployment ZIP Code Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mercury Cougar Cable television The Humble Guys Publicly funded medicine Manual transmission Darius (arcade game) Fire extinguisher Deer Twin Peaks Space Shuttle Enterprise Poker jargon Paragliding Mouse (computing) Violin Donovan Kit Kat Nuclear power

do you hang out with your boss after work off the clock and does it effect everyone else at work i don't but it's interesting you should ask a couple of years ago hr was asked to give our department some suggestions on building moral it was pretty low they suggested the boss occasionally takes the employees out to lunch or even a business lunch to show they are not above the average employee as far as importance my supervisor said she wouldn't do that it's too personal and it would allow the employee to feel to comfortable around her that was the point for the boss to be more approachable but now a couple of years later things have changed she's going to lunch every day with the same employees she not buying the lunch but they are still together everyday but it's only these couple of people nobody else i personally feel it's favoritism why was she so adamantly against it at first but now she does it every day i don t like it i ve noticed other favors being given to these employees to they get to be the exceptions to the rules policies and procedures  Theory of conduct Milton H.

can you help me with this business case thanks the dressing corp was a manufacturer of high quality undershirts this company started up by copying popular styles and designs from u k the st years was quite profitable in the market for undershirts suddenly took a downturn it was no longer fashionable to wear undershirts more and more factories sprouted up and willing to compromise on price and payment the company was astounded a year later the dressing corp started feel the pinch the introduced bubbles which was a new brand of exactly the same product quality but priced lower to match competing products having failed to improve the marketability of its traditional product lines the company added a couple of lines like jeans and printed shirts whch also failed at this point managements thought that one way to save the dwindling profitability ws to infuse more capital to modernize its factory and produced btter qualty product q should the owners of dressing corp infuse additional funds to the company y q how dressing corp could have avoided its losses this is way too complex a question to expect a comprehensive answer here properly done it could take many a pages and would need dozens if not hundreds more questions being asked of you first however in a globule it sounds as though a company originally based on high quality and presumably a decent price tag started to try and compete on price with an outdated product not good if the company has something of a quality reputation than dropping the price to cheapo levels just starts to kill of the brand value look what happened to pierre cardin years ago his brand was worth something if you owned something with that name on it was a special creation which many people were happy to pay good money for now it is as exclusive as an aldi woolworths special pierre cardin no thanks i'll save up and buy something better from argos so bubble was just heh look dressing corp is no longer exclusive we have introcuded a budget range of stuff for the poverty stricken to buy the fact that the quality was the same would not be belived or understood by most people so price cutting is not the answer never is in the long run unless you can afford to produce vast quantity and work on the basis of p a garment profit multiplied by garments a week will keep the creditors at bay adding additional funds may be an idea but only if this is being done with some decent marketing not sales strategies in place first the jeans and printed shirts are not the sort of thing than you might normally associate with high quality manufacture more a cheap n cheerful rag shifter perhaps finding what the original customers were now buying instead quality shirts as opposed to undershirts perhaps other quality products geared at the customers that already are familiar with the product you used to sell as i say this is not a comprehensive answer but this question cannot simply be answered mark  Keynesian economics Trademark Microeconomics Undergarment Sears Holdings Corporation Gross domestic product Deflation (economics) Privatization Aldi Commodore International Clothing Insurance Economics AMD Monetary policy Capital accumulation Inflation Ford Motor Company CPU cache Strategic management PE ratio Mutual fund CPU design United Kingdom corporation tax Intellectual property Free trade Law of value Publishing Short selling Supply and demand Price discrimination Commodity Natural monopoly Illegal drug trade Tax Dot-com Tariff Citigroup BMW Airline Bond Great Depression Extreme Programming Productive and unproductive labour Surplus value Tesco Supply-side economics Topps Say's law Capitalism Bretton Woods system Bulk vending American individualist anarchism Islamic banking Economy of Africa Prices of production First-sale doctrine Pricing Life insurance Hyperinflation Lionel Corporation Xerox Marketing Nortel Networks Manual transmission Labor theory of value Mattress Daewoo Plastic Monopoly Enron Corporation Exchange value Gramophone record FairTax Public good Mergers and acquisitions Digital photography Internet fraud Publicly funded medicine Atari ST Ashton-Tate Laserdisc Health insurance Schwinn Bicycle Company Temasek Holdings Fair use History of the United States (1918-1945) ITV Apple Computer SCO-Linux controversies Bank Data General

why do american auto manufacturers always want to set standards like japanese auto manufacturers just seems americans did so much better before we tried to do this totaly different culture and way of living and the big are slowly sinking when the japanese entered the us auto industry with quality products the american manufacturers could not stand up to them i think it was theory z or something like that where american companies applied japanese methods to working i wrote my sociology paper on this i was the only one to say it just doesn't work one because the japanese have a throw away work force wives are often used in times of greater need and then just not used at other times two japanese have different standards of working the proper japanese man will work all hours to prove that he is a good worker three they try to raise company togetherness with morning exercises and other plans four the japanese only have certain people that are allowed to rise to management the peons remain the peons none of this will work here we're just not going for it the best part of theory z was that japanese managers were rotated so that they knew all aspects of the job that is excellent as opposed to the bureaucratic way americans do business here managers rise to the height of their incompetance the japanese train their managers on all aspects of the job and you are required to perform the big three are sinking because they have allowed union wages to rise so high that they have priced themselves out of making an excellent product i'm all for unions but you have to remember that the job is only worth so much to the employer while i endorse buying only american products i have always bought japanese autos since they stopped rusting so quick and have had excellent cars i was so tired of cars that just had problem after problem want to hear about just how bad that lincoln was or the mpg i was getting and the dealer couldn't fix it i couldn't keep it on the road and found myself standing all alone in various places quite often i bought a nissan truck and would have just bought another but they have lowered their standards and are now competing at an american level so i bought a honda man did they ever lie about the mileage green rating my ss so i may be going american next time maybe that will help  Tariff Ford Motor Company Unemployment Inflation Hybrid vehicle Sport utility vehicle Keynesian economics Tire Labour economics Battery electric vehicle Wayne Corporation 24 Hours of Le Mans Fuel efficiency Wal-Mart Honda Dodge Charger Capitalism Minimum wage Labor theory of value Software engineering Drifting (motorsport) Supply and demand Capital accumulation Outsourcing Economics Principal-agent problem Exploitation Microeconomics Auto racing Truck History of the United States (1918-1945) Poker jargon Bretton Woods system Business process reengineering Nissan Gross domestic product Efficiency wages Privatization Insurance Graduate school Toyota Camry Economic history of Japan Mazda Industrial engineering Henry Ford Management Education in the People's Republic of China New Deal Canadian and American economies compared Passenger car American Motors Volleyball Industrial Revolution Rail terminology Headlight Audi Chrysler Corporation Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK) Ltd Deflation (economics) Welding Toyota Prius Auto insurance Mazda Miata Economy of the United States Sears Holdings Corporation Progressive tax Quality control Mercedes-Benz Call centre Apprenticeship Bicycle Competition Monetary policy Hyundai Motor Company Health insurance Sweatshop ISO 9000 De Lorean DMC-12 Workplace democracy Just In Time Carburetor Electronic commerce Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economic inequality West Side Highway Hard disk Chevrolet Corvette Ford Falcon

finance calculation lease vs purchase hi i'm reading this finance book and as an exercise they have this question about purchasing vs leasing somehow i'm confused with the pv concept here's the question you're considering buying an asset that has a three year life and costs as an alternative to buying the asset you can lease it for year four annual payments first due on the day you sign the lease if you can borrow from your bank at should you buy or lease the answer is lease the pv of the lease option is pv for excel readers but what i don't understand is the concept behind the pv in this case the purchase will cost you while the lease will cost you at least how come the answer is lease if you have to borrow the at then the buying will cost you more this is kind of a ridiculous scenario what has a three year life that would be that expensive let's look at a real life scenario where you buy a car at versus leasing something at a year even if you pay more during the lease time the lessor is left with nothing at the end of the lease while the buyer actually has a car that's worth probably around my advice if you're in the market for something that costs and is not going to be worth anything in years i have some nice swamp land in florida that you should have a look at cheers  Microeconomics Islamic banking Futures contract Personal finance Stock Intermediate consumption Mutual fund Deflation (economics) Tax Debt Annuity Student loan Cost of capital Option Inflation Supply and demand Rational pricing Consumption of fixed capital Hyperinflation Insurance Corporate finance Finance Surplus value Gross domestic product Derivative (finance) Leasehold estate Interest Hire purchase Mergers and acquisitions Economics Monetary policy Call option Arbitrage Contract Operating surplus Intellectual property Bond Asset Economy of the United States Gold standard PE ratio Labor theory of value Predatory lending Credit card Margin (finance) Food Stamp Program Capital accumulation Productive and unproductive labour Housing cooperative Citigroup Option style Capitalism Black-Scholes Commodore International Credit derivative Money FairTax Berkshire Hathaway BC Rail Delta Air Lines Put option Real estate Enron Corporation Estoppel Auto insurance Air New Zealand Corporation Warren Buffett Institutional fund management Pension Model (economics) Donald Trump Federal Reserve Internet fraud United Kingdom corporation tax 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Wheel of Fortune Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Social Credit Money supply Health insurance Wal-Mart Arrangements between railroads Timeline of the Enron scandal Oakland Athletics Interest rate Social Security (United States) Monty Hall problem Opportunity cost Depreciation Trademark

this question is for accounting class why is it necessary to identify debtors and creditors you need to identify debtors so you know who owes you money and for how long in order to facilitate collection procedures and to note who is always a bad paymaster this will affect his future credit terms or you might decide not to sell him your goods anymore you need to identify creditors so you know who you owe money to and whether to pay now or later to take advantage of cash discounts you also don't want to delay payment to important creditors too long in case they decide to stop supplying you in future this may affect your production process you'll have to source for another supplier and you run the risk of having a bad name in the industry  Bond Deflation (economics) Debt Islamic banking Corporate finance Fractional-reserve banking Estoppel Bank Credit card Insurance Government debt Bankruptcy in the United States Mortgage Economy of Russia Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Finance Mutual fund Inflation Brady Bonds Bretton Woods system Article One of the United States Constitution Cheque Capital accumulation Interest Hercules Linton Great Depression Economy of Bolivia Productive and unproductive labour Bad faith Economy of Romania Security (finance) Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code Hyperinflation Concurrent estate Internet fraud Financial audit Annuity Tax Babylonian law Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Corporation Student loan U.S. public debt Magna Carta Anarchism and capitalism Arbitrage Legal fiction FairTax Child support Derivative (finance) Accounting methods Short selling Developing countries' debt Electronic commerce Stock Health insurance Intellectual property Credit derivative Credit repair Gold standard Enron Corporation Corporate governance Rational pricing Electronic money Financial markets Information Services Procurement Library Credit risk Copyleft Personal finance Management information system Schabir Shaik Trial Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code Mergers and acquisitions Life insurance Publicly funded medicine Capitalism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Oil-for-Food Programme Trademark Jade Empire Software testing Economy of the United States Just In Time United States Postal Service Economy of Ghana Baccarat Bolivia Scenario planning Futures contract Construction Surveillance RFID Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Debt bondage Contract

http amedia disney go com investorrelations q pdf what are depreciation meethods used this is for homework and i am a bit lost on how you can tell straight line is the same every year right double declining is doubled every year right yo i've taken any accounting classes for at least years but i think you looking at the wrong stuff parks resorts and other property parks resorts and other property are carried at historical cost depreciation is computed on the straight line method over estimated useful lives as follows attractions years buildings and improvements years leasehold improvements life of lease or asset life if less land improvements years furniture fixtures and equipment years table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets the company performs an annual impairment test at fiscal year end for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets including fcc licenses and trademarks as required by statement of financial accounting standards no goodwill and other intangible assets sfas goodwill is allocated to various reporting units which are generally one level below our operating segments to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment sfas requires the company to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount on an annual basis if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its goodwill to determine the fair value of our reporting units we generally use a present value technique discounted cash flow corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate except for the abc television network a business within the media networks operating segment for which we used a revenue multiple we did not use a present value technique or a market multiple approach to value the abc television network as a present value technique would not capture its full fair value and there is little comparable market data available due to the scarcity of television networks we applied what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies the impairment test results could differ sfas requires the company to compare the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset to its carrying amount if the carrying amount of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized fair values for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows market multiples or appraised values as appropriate we completed our impairment testing as of september which resulted in a non cash impairment charge of million related to certain fcc licenses primarily associated with espn radio stations reflecting an overall market decline in certain radio markets in which we operate amortizable intangible assets principally copyrights are amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from years however their other assets studio entertainment consumer products etc could be under macrs it could not acrs since the useful life would run out already or has been used straight line anyhow ps i let you know

what is the possiblity that the us treasury will default on it's notes bonds in the next years i know we haven't defaulted yet but can that last forever can it even last more years pretty slim the reason for this is that they can always print more money i would think they would rather have the value of the dollar go down then risk the uprising of the country think about it they can print as much money as they want sure it would cause a jump in inflation but what would be worse defaulting would be alot worse  Government debt U.S. public debt Government bond Debt United States dollar Fractional-reserve banking Hyperinflation Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Money Bond Interest Monetary policy Interest rate Arbitrage Treasury security Deflation (economics) Inflation Mortgage-backed security Euro Money supply Yield curve High-yield debt Privatization Currency Asian financial crisis Social Security (United States) Bretton Woods system U.S. ten-dollar bill Philippine peso Free trade Economic history of the United States Bank Gold standard Annuity Bank fraud U.S. two-dollar bill United States Department of the Treasury Luiz In__cio Lula da Silva Argentine Currency Board United Artists Argentine debt restructuring Banknote Pound sterling Carlos Salinas Mortgage December 2001 riots (Argentina) Brady Bonds Economy of Pakistan U.S. one hundred-dollar bill Predatory lending Tariff Floppy disk Economy of Argentina Social Security debate (United States) Usury Real (currency) Economy of Russia Eugene Fama Repurchase agreement Credit default swap Credit derivative In God We Trust U.S. five-dollar bill Gold as an investment Economy of Brazil Economy of the United States Password Fiat money Bank of England PE ratio Hong Kong dollar Present value U.S. fifty-dollar bill Keynesian economics Australian dollar Credit risk Canadian dollar Derivative (finance) Government National Mortgage Association Unreal Reaganomics Control flow Popular revolt in late medieval Europe Institutional fund management Moody's Student loan Taxation in the United States Central bank Consumer price index Weimar Republic Cost of capital New Taiwan dollar Tort reform Standard & Poor's Legal tender 50 (number) Counterfeit Narcissism Deficit

am i bound legally by a term sheet sent via email but never signed i was considering doing some freelance web coding work on the side of my full time job the individual who needed the work done had emailed me a term sheet something i did not consider legally binding like a signed contract it listed the due dates amount to be paid and other details he would send it to me and ask me to approve it i did not sign anything well at the start of the project i realized it would be too much work for me to do on top of my full time job and i wrote a very respectful letter saying that i thought it best if i do not do the project while i acknowledge i was wrong and that i should not have spoken with them to begin with can i be sued on the basis of this term sheet given via email nothing in the term sheet says i was legally bound by its contents any help getting everything in writing is always recommended so both parties have a complete understanding and agree with the terms of the contract without it it's simply his word against yours and if problems occur it's very hard to decide who is at fault etc sending it via email is ok as long as it is printed on paper hard copy and signed by both parties without both people signing their signature to it there is no proof that either of you even saw it and anyone could have approved it although it is a legally binding agreement it still remains difficult to enforce in a court of law the reasons being that any true and legal document contract etc should be witnessed and signed by a lawyer or notary to make sure that the terms stated are even allowed in all documents such as yours there should always be a clause allowing for unknown circumstances extra costs delays changes etc and both should initial the clause in other words you both agree to the terms but you both are flexible term sheet is simply describing the requirements they want you to follow they can try to sue you but it would be costly and time consuming and they are not guaranteed to win  Contract Notary public Plame affair Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Treaty Public domain Appeal Article One of the United States Constitution United States Constitution Supreme Court of the United States Kyoto Protocol Public-key cryptography Estoppel Patent Computer virus GNU General Public License Divorce Salary cap Annuity Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Constitution of Ireland Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Legal research SCO-Linux controversies Copyright Standard form contract Insurance XML Same-sex marriage in the United States United States Postal Service Originalism Intellectual property Copyright law of the United Kingdom Medical prescription Arbitration Common criticisms of Microsoft Computer Cryptography Open access Spam (electronic) Leasing E-mail Australian constitutional law Due process Same-sex marriage in Canada Stopping e-mail abuse Mediation Royal Assent Offer and acceptance Trademark Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs OpenDocument Microeconomics Scots law International Criminal Court Freedom of speech Killian documents Legal aspects of transsexualism Life insurance Bush v.

is it worth making a spreadsheet for my ebay stock i was thinking of making a spreadsheet with colour size price of purchase rrp selling price etc to keep track of my ebay items even before i put them up for sale do you think it would be worth it or would it just be a waste of time i already keep a written book but that is only for items taht have sold and only includes a short description of the item and the rest is just to keep track if the buyer has paid etc i think it's a great idea and one that you should implement as a backup to your written log it is very easy to do and you can edit on the fly as needed it is also an easier way to track your profits and something you can utilize in the event of an irs audit  Auction Microeconomics Arbitrage IBM PC compatible Day trading Supply and demand Tax Amazon.com Internet fraud FairTax Wal-Mart Dot-com Put option Enron Corporation Ashton-Tate Monopoly (game) Islamic banking Electronic commerce Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Taxation in the United States Economics Lotus Improv Oil-for-Food Programme Option Enterprise content management Option style Microsoft The Apprentice 2 Call option Price discrimination Abebooks RuneScape economy Bulk vending Short selling Keynesian economics Apple Macintosh Topps Commodity markets Borland Live 8 Commodity BC Rail Suggested retail price MMORPG Neopets Textbook Stock Illegal drug trade World of Warcraft Network effect Mutual fund Atari ST Ayumi Hamasaki Spreadsheet Inflation Investment bank First-sale doctrine Privatization Political economy Comiket Berkshire Hathaway Xerox Star Apple II family Konfabulator Lionel Corporation Philatelic investment Halliburton The Wealth of Nations Use case Employee stock option Free market Argos (retailer) Great Depression Vending machine Tesco Hyperinflation OpenDocument RuneScape skills Virtual economy My Little Pony ITunes Music Store Warren Buffett Stock market Security (finance) The Long Tail American individualist anarchism Derivative (finance) Windows Server 2003 Online auction business model J Sainsbury Costco Quattro Pro Citigroup Futures contract Management information system Visual Basic Monetary policy Loss leader Deflation (economics)

how much overtime is to much i usually work about hours of overtime a week but i was told if i do to much overtime when tax time comes around they won't give me as much back is this right and if so how much and how much is to much overtime overtime is the obligation of your employer to pay you extra you're taxed on the money you make less tax deductions if you're getting money back that means you are having more money withheld from your paycheck than you are going to owe in taxes so they give you back the excess as far as i know overtime is just more money that's taxed which means more is withheld if you're withholding more from the overtime than you owe to them you're going to get it back it's as simple as this they want a specific percentage of your money look up the personal tax rate schedule no more no less if you give more they're just going to give it back it's best to adjust your withholding so that you give them enough but not so much extra because you then have to wait until tax time for it i hope i've made it clear taxes can be very confusing accountants spend much of their time just keeping up with the changes be careful taking advice about taxes a lot of the time you're getting advise from someone who got it from someone else who didn't know what he or she was talking about telephone game anyone take it easy that's a lot of overtime regardless of the tax situation ps after reading another response i'd like to mention something about the tax brackets when you reach a higher tax bracket only the money above that certain amount is taxed at the higher rate think of it as layers and the higher the layer is the more it gets taxed the bottom layer will be tax no matter how high the top later is  Tax Taxation in the United States Microeconomics Progressive tax Flat tax Social Security (United States) Income tax FairTax Wal-Mart Child support Royal Assent Supply and demand Tax bracket Life insurance Annuity Poker jargon Bond Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Keynesian economics Credit card United Kingdom corporation tax Student loan Capital accumulation Health savings account Government debt Overtime Tax resistance Health insurance Publicly funded medicine Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mutual fund Video game developer Mortgage Regressive tax Unemployment Inheritance tax Capitalism Social rule Gross domestic product Working time Arthur Laffer Salary cap Property tax Corporation Education in the People's Republic of China Social Security debate (United States) Economy of Russia Redundant array of independent disks Tax avoidance/evasion Education in the United States Surplus value PE ratio Money George W.

supermarket charged me too much i was told they supposed to give me the item for free and my money back as they had over charged me on a item is this true that depends on the store policy i always try to check my reciept before i leave the store and get it taken care of right away sometimes i wonder if the store does it on purpose though ring stuff up wrong cause they know that most people don't look at their receipt or the customer thinks it's only a few cents that was lost by them well in reality if alot of people buy that product and are overcharged then the store will make out like bandits if nobody reports it or requests a refund  Wal-Mart Fry's Electronics EFTPOS Supermarket United States Postal Service Aldi Taxation in the United States Cash register Arbitrage Filling station Retailer Mutual fund Oil-for-Food Programme Vending machine Octopus card Best Buy Argos (retailer) RFID Internet fraud Poker jargon Bulk vending Health insurance Annuity Surveillance MapleStory Loss leader FairTax Rebate (marketing) Publicly funded medicine RuneScape locations Predatory lending Blockbuster Video Minor characters in Morrowind Marks & Spencer ITunes Music Store Neopets Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Theory of conduct Automatic teller machine Universal Product Code Financial audit Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Social rule Tesco ASDA Bank Sears Holdings Corporation Animal Crossing Strap-on dildo E-mail spam Tax Craps Food Stamp Program Something Awful Credit card Pricing RuneScape cheats Advertising Price discrimination Wood Shopping Dollar store Neighbours Information Services Procurement Library Insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Battery (electricity) Common criticisms of Microsoft Public good Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act CPU cache Boots Group Organic food Electronic commerce My Name Is Earl Castle of the Winds The Amazing Race Money Fancy Crane Tom DeLay Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Babylonian law Inventory Primerica Financial Services Freenet Commodity markets Contract Confidence trick Domain Name System Islamic banking The Invisibles Lionel Corporation Time Out of Mind Auto rickshaw RuneScape economy RuneScape skills Spidey Super Stories Jennifer Lopez The Apprentice 2 Cable television

ask me any investment or business oriented question and i will answer it whoever is able to stump me will win i will use my knowledge from going to both wharton and harvard business school to answer them i will not use any outside sources such as wikipedia if you do not believe me then i do not care and you will not get points by win i mean you get points for the second guy i would recommed that you first get your spending under control if you need to just stop going to resturants and all that extra crap people usually do instead stay home conserve as much as you can eat smaller portions get more bargains that will save you a lot of money even if you have to sell your land and move into a smaller home but whatver you are more comfortable with depending on the loan perhaps that would be a good idea i remeber as a kid i took out a student loan and i put the money i got into the bank the student loan was around interest but the bank had so i made money if you ever read this businessweek article they talked about how going back to school was sometimes the worst thing people ever did just remeber before you do anything read what it says always get a fixed rate while in massage school get a secondary job which can help pay off get as many jobs as you can handle to pay of this send me an im for more info for the first guy i am sorry but i can not follow your incoherency your statment was a rhetorical question and even if a question i would not be able to answer it as it made no sense third person you are an idiot who has caved into cnbc's trap anything that they say has already happened and will make you no money jim cramer has an agenda i mean have you ever seen his stocks go up for more than one week after he recommends them i mean like i recommend apple in january and cnbc did not touch on it until a couple weeks ago all those books are stupidity i mean i never read any of those books besides the essentials for class and it worked well for me business is never by the book there are always twists and turns and dude it is mergers aquisitions not marketing whatever you just showed your stupidity m a is the most prestigous division of any bank in the world to the fourth person well a cpa is a certified public accountant and the cfa is a chartered financial analyst the cfa has a better career income for their credentials are harder to achieve well i cannot quantitatively because i do not have the keys for that but i will try r x i l x x f xi dx is the parameter risk functions of a estimator x observables x loss function l of course apple can survive in such a way because it causes amazing returns apple will be selling million iphones in one year and plans to be doing so for a while and then go to million by putting alot of money into research a product that everyone wants will be formed but of course with a lot of marketing too what do you mean by what can i say about patent laws could you please clarify so i can make an appropriate response there are credit default swap cross currency swap equity swap foreign exchange swap constant maturity swap yield curve inter bank swaps brokers variance swap interest rate swap total return swap and for the last question every business has risk but i would have to say selling lemonaide on the side of the street i am sorry sir that your idea of challenged is not following the strict guidlines of this website perhaps that is why you find yourself at the same mental capacity as me and feel you can question me you are a useless article in society who questions my intelligence because i would rather write this on this website rather than a forum perhaps you technology degree from devry college gives you the scrotal fortitude to talk this way ok i owe something like thousand dollars most of it is credit card debt some of it is now at because they raised the interest for some unknown reason at least to me my wife won't let me borrow against our land to reduce the interest i have to pay like a month just to keep up or so is proabably just interest  Bond Mortgage Supply-side economics Insurance Microeconomics Money Monetary policy Interest Credit card Bank Government debt Debt

e bay question on feedback this is something i just don't get so maybe someone can explain it to me i have bought quite a few things off e bay over the last three years and not once have i ever gotten feedback until after i left feedback first why is this i always make sure to pay through paypal within an hour of winning i've been verified through paypal i'm legit why is it so hard for people to give feedback based on promptness of payment i mean as the buyer that is my sole responsibility to pay anyone tia feedback hostage most sellers don't consider a transaction to be complete until the buyer leaves feedback indicating that they are satisfied too many sellers have left positive feedback when they received payment only to later get scammed by the buyer who claimed they didn't receive the item that it arrived damaged or even worse the buyer buys and item pays with paypal using a credit card and receives the item they then file a claim with paypal saying the credit card was stolen when in fact it was obvious they made the purchase with their own card so most sellers do not leave feedback until after they know the item has arrived in good condition and the buyer is happy not exactly the way the system was set up to work but it is what it has become i still leave feedback when i receive payment but the vast majority of sellers do not if i ever get screwed though i will stop that practice  Internet fraud Phishing Contract Microeconomics Supply and demand Extreme Programming Economics Real estate broker Credit card Islamic banking Surveillance Electronic commerce Hire purchase Commodity markets Capitalism Price discrimination Liberty Dollar Warranty Topps Anarchist economics Something Awful Gold standard Something Awful Forums Money Futures contract Option Surplus value Mortgage Conveyancing Possession Oakland Athletics Discounts and allowances MapleStory Tax Electronic money Oil-for-Food Programme Ethical consumerism Reputation management Feedback Taxation in the United States Arbitrage IBM PC compatible B__rgerliches Gesetzbuch Short selling Credit derivative Bulk vending Minimum wage FairTax Micropayment Anarchism and capitalism Auto insurance Pyramid scheme Technical analysis Call option Dot-com ITunes Music Store Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Subscription business model Mail fraud Gross domestic product Advance fee fraud Health insurance Marketing Dividend The Amazing Race United Kingdom corporation tax Insurance Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Theory of conduct Monetary policy EFTPOS The Wealth of Nations Poker jargon Neopets Annuity Plame affair Hyperinflation E-gold Steam (content delivery) Monopsony Security (finance) Atari ST Derivative (finance) Publicly funded medicine Monopoly Fair market value Mouse (computing) Blackjack Wal-Mart

how much does it cost financially to be a free mason hey that's a great question unfortunately it isn't so easy to answer because since freemasonry has no central governing organization the fee structures vary with constitution to constitution and lodge to lodge i know conspiracy theorists will be appalled to hear that there is no central governing body of freemasonry shooting a hole in all of their world domination theories i can only speak of my state and my lodge here in massachusetts in the u s a my lodge was chartered by paul revere in and is one of the oldest lodges in the us we just recently voted for a dues increase to keep up with the cost of meeting in our facility when i joined the dues were a year this had remained unchanged for about years and shortly thereafter we raised it to and are now in the process of increasing them again to a year that said we meet in one of the most beautiful masonic buildings on prime real estate right in the middle of the city lodges in more rural communities wouldn't even dream of charging so much so right now what a new member of our lodge would pay is this a one time initiation fee of which goes towards educational materials and administration fees then the yearly dues will be a year after that each member contributes per dinner depending on the venue with meetings a year that would be per year add to that any transportation costs or other donations not covered from dues and it could be around a year but i would say that would be a maximum that said this is a figure for my lodge and i am very sure that we are at the high end of the spectrum for us lodges so i would say that chances are if you are talking about a lodge in the us you are talking about a figure considerably less than the ones i have given here if you have any other questions about freemasonry please feel free to contact me  Freemasonry Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Students' union Corporation Government of India Solar cell Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Student loan Head of state Poker jargon Ordo Templi Orientis Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Politics of the United States Taxation in the United States United Nations Mutual fund British House of Commons Microeconomics Plame affair U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Parliament of the United Kingdom Silvio Berlusconi Canadian House of Commons 9/11 conspiracy theories Tax Eye of Providence Australian Labor Party Political subdivisions of New York State Barrister Parliament of Canada Labor theory of value United States Postal Service Illuminati Prince Hall Public good Anti-Freemasonry Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Same-sex marriage in Canada Voluntary Student Unionism Town meeting Vladimir Lenin Cable television Constitution of India Canadian and American politics compared Insurance Education in England Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis Government of France Class in the contemporary United States Theory of conduct Unreformed House of Commons Tuition Betting (poker) Economics Appeal Democracy Politics of the United Kingdom Welding Rosicrucian Albert Pike Inflation Publicly funded medicine Social Security (United States) Economy of Belgium Estates-General of 1789 Hillary Rodham Clinton Politics of the People's Republic of China Margaret Thatcher Corporatism Bill Clinton Public education Economy of India Mortgage U.S. presidential election, 2008 SAT Snooker Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Government of Australia Enlargement of the European Union Advance fee fraud Mother Teresa Renormalization Copyleft Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia United States Senate Australian constitutional law Constitution Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji)

why are there still labor unions in america would we be better or worse off without them in states where labor unions are heavy the cost of living is much higher and taxes usually too in those open shop states with few if any labor unions the cost of living is lower along with taxes of course the wages in open shop states are less too what is the answer here are labor unions a big player in why jobs are being shipped overseas or is that just massive corporate greed is everyone with a k a contributor to jobs being shipped overseas if you want your returns higher than you work to get the company to cut costs and labor is a huge cost especially when you add in benefits it is solely because of the advent of unions that we have standards that must be adhered to by all employers unions paved the way for better working conditions as a whole for everyone in this country not just unions unions are the great equalizer to the tyranical ceo who if they could would pay everyone pennies on the dollar and do away with all benefits we see this happening even today in the airline industry the heads of the comapny are slowly breaking the unions and now have been able to get out of paying pensions to retired pilots who depend on that money unions tend to get the brunt of negative media especially when there is some strike happening don't be fooled it takes a a huge sacrifice and enormous leap of faith to go out on strike union members are often made out to be greedy in wanting more but i assure you it is a micro fraction of the money that the companies and ceo' s are putting in their pockets in the case of the airlines strikes of the 's it was union members getting fed up with having to take concessions over the years for the good of the company only to have promises broken by management when it was time to make good on those promises if unions die off in this country we are in for serious trouble you think outsourcing jobs to india is bad pfffft in my opinion people who talk down about unions are living in severe ignorance and aught not open their mouth until they get un ignered  Trade union Outsourcing Microeconomics Airline Sweatshop Wal-Mart Inflation Free trade Tariff Life insurance Capitalism Offshoring Unemployment Social Security (United States) Labor theory of value Capital accumulation Tax Enron Corporation Progressive tax Privatization Deflation (economics) United Kingdom corporation tax Pension 401(k) Social Security debate (United States) Anarchism and capitalism Mutual fund Taxation in the United States Insurance Flat tax Keynesian economics Natural monopoly Economic inequality Salary cap Economy of India 2004-05 NHL lockout Health insurance History of the United States (1918-1945) Graduate school Economy of the United States Publicly funded medicine Transport Workers Union of America Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bretton Woods system U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 History of the United States (1865-1918) Labour economics Northwest Airlines Subsidy Ryanair Ponzi scheme Industrial Revolution Hyperinflation United States labor law Great Depression in the United Kingdom Apple Computer Economy of Norway Annuity United States Postal Service Kyoto Protocol United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America British Airways Frank Lorenzo Economy of Russia Economic history of Britain Price discrimination Surplus value Great Depression Wayne Corporation Australian labour movement Value added tax Labor-power United States dollar Gold standard Welding Supply and demand Monetary policy Diseconomies of scale Economy of France Freeters Unemployment benefit Economy of Africa FairTax Working time Canadian and American economies compared Blackjack International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union Politics of the United States Trickle down effect Criticism of libertarianism Culture of the United States Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards

i think my bank have been untruthful to delay the bank charges claim i'm making what is my legal position they sent me a letter saying they had not received the itemised list which i sent them i called into my branch who confirmed that they had they then assured me the matter would be dealt with as quickly as possible after another couple of weeks i emailed them and they said an offer letter had been sent out but this was apparently sent before the letter saying they couldn't deal with my claim because they didn't have the itemised list they said they'd send the letter out again but never did and now tell me they can't deal with my case due to the ofd case i think they deliberately stalled my claim by lying to me but it's difficult to prove and i don't know what my legal position is this is a very difficult situation unfortunately you did not follow the correct procedure as the itemised list of charges should of been sent to the banks head office and not to your local branch and should have been sent by recorded delivery so that you could prove they received it its very unlikely in these recent times that they would have made you an offer without you taking court action or taking the case to the financial ombudsman all you could do now is to resend your letter with your list of charges to the banks head office by recorded delivery eliminitating all doubt about whether when they received it this will also lock the date of your claim all claims are currently on hold but doing this will ensure that the matter will be dealt with as quickly as possible when the oft hopefully win the case i m sure it's not your fault that the incorrect procedure was followed unfortunately theres a lot of info out there on the web now that is just plain wrong even on some of the big well known sites this makes it a bit of a minefield for new claimants the biggest way to see if the information is incorrect is if it mentions sending talking to your local branch this is completely wrong as the local branches have no input in settling claims its all done at the banks head office and its a great way for your claim to get lost have a look at my site below which has detailed step by step guides to claiming all information has been tried and tested throughout the entire process so is known to be correct and has helped many people to claim back thousands from a range of banks and building societies the site is free to use  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Appeal Advance fee fraud United States Postal Service Telephone exchange Mediation Legal research Contract Scots law Killian documents E-mail spam Patent Theory of conduct Software testing Internet fraud Enron Corporation SCO-Linux controversies Scientology beliefs and practices Government of France Data retention CPU cache Credit card Financial audit Spice Girls Downing Street memo Consensus decision-making Surveillance Actor model Sponsorship scandal Public-key cryptography Information Technology Infrastructure Library Mumia Abu-Jamal Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Copyright Pretty Good Privacy Scientific method Debugging Compiler optimization Jumpstart 3rd Grade Mail Snooker M16 (rifle) Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Credit repair Philosophical skepticism Judiciary of Hong Kong Dog training Oscilloscope Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints E-mail X Window System Identity theft Annuity National Weather Service Sin City The Standard Speaker of the British House of Commons Chronology of the Ancient Near East Spam Prevention Early Warning System Monty Hall problem Bank fraud Corporate personhood SAS System Divorce SAT Florida Central Voter File Bah__'__ divisions Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) AMD Plame affair timeline Poker jargon Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 7 President of Ireland European Union Constitution of Ireland Theodicy Politics of Russia Corporate governance Act of Parliament Conspiracy David Blunkett 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Requirements analysis Nuclear option (filibuster) Nuclear weapon Anonymous remailer Israeli West Bank barrier

why should accountants still be employed even if there are accounting softwares in the market sources are very welcomed in your answers opinions are well accepted i want to prove although accounting softwares are made to help in the accounting system businesses should still employ accountants to ensure the quality and assurance of their financial statements thank you very much the accounting software is only as good as the information entered into it you need a qualified accountant to enter the information and to properly review financial statements otherwise if there was an error an unqualified person will not catch it any accountant at a month end close will tell you the hardest part of their jobs is figuring out why the numbers are off and to find the system human errors you also need an accountant that can write the reports so they are customized and have the proper information since not all companies want to see the same information the same way plus a programmer that doesn t understand accounting doesn t know if the report they wrote is really pulling the correct information as an accountant i was so frustrated with the programmers getting the information wrong or pulling a number from a field that looked the same but really wasn t and thinking it was good enough that i learned sql so i could write my own reports it saved me a ton of time and the company a ton of money  Extreme Programming Software testing Corporate governance United Kingdom corporation tax Debugging Software engineering Database management system Password Plame affair Outsourcing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Annuity Management information system Financial audit Object-SQL mapping Information Technology Infrastructure Library Database Contract Pretty Good Privacy Year 2000 problem Microsoft Enron Corporation Electronic commerce Biblical inerrancy Gross domestic product Open-source software Customer relationship management Embedded system Economics Requirements analysis Call centre SAP R/3 Life insurance Reliability engineering ISO 9000 Perl Credit card SAS System National Kidney Foundation Singapore Financial statements Game programmer Quality control Sarbanes-Oxley Act Insurance Computer virus Accountancy Speech recognition Scientific method Business performance management TransUnion Bank Theory of conduct Appeal Killian documents Philosophy of mathematics Strategic management SQL EastEnders Enterprise resource planning DVD Epistemology Database normalization Expert system Offshoring SCO-Linux controversies MDAC Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Floppy disk Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Money supply Sola fide Philosophy of language XML Information technology audit Game programming Btrieve Oil-for-Food Programme Oracle Corporation IBM PC compatible Risk management Dynamic Systems Development Method Rational Unified Process 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Information Services Procurement Library Microsoft Jet Database Engine Enterprise content management Science Software bug Search engine optimization Computer software Coming of Age (TNG episode) Graduate school Buffer overflow PL/SQL Creative accounting OpenDocument

can you transfer a pension and get and get a cash lump sum in the uk if you are currently contributing to a uk pension scheme it's possible you could transfer your pension to another scheme but there is no benefit in doing this unless you are changing your employer some contributory pension schemes will allow part of a pension to be taken as a lump sum on retirement but you would need to ask your fund administrator about the rules for your particular scheme if you are already a pensioner or a deferred pensioner you have ceased making contributions but have not yet retired then it is incredibly unlikely you would be able either to transfer a pension or take a cash lump sum if you are talking about a state pension then the simple answer is no  Annuity Retirement plan Ponzi scheme Social security Life insurance Social Security (United States) Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation Insurance 401(k) National Insurance Tax Individual Retirement Account Department for Work and Pensions Unemployment benefit Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Trust (Law) USA Social Security debate (United States) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Retirement Canada Health Act Taxation in the United States Employee Retirement Income Security Act Professor Mortgage Mutual fund Microeconomics Centrelink Taxation in Canada Enron Corporation Secretary of State for Work and Pensions United States Department of Veterans Affairs Meiji period Bank fraud Princely state Compensation of employees United Kingdom corporation tax Article One of the United States Constitution Student loan Citigroup Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Panay incident Timeline of the Enron scandal Debt Payroll Confidence trick SCO-Linux controversies Voluntary Student Unionism Income trust Economy of Russia Same-sex marriage in New York Mensal__o scandal CPU cache Dave Reichert Password Gross domestic product Money creation Robert Maxwell Public bodies and task forces of the UK government Amtrak History of the United States (1918-1945) Canadian and American politics compared William Beveridge Treasury security United States labor law Registered Retirement Savings Plan Embezzlement Individual Savings Account Genuine Progress Indicator Freelancer Kazakhstan Tertiary education fees in Australia Collateralized debt obligation Freeters Wealth Institutional fund management Education in England Andrew Carnegie Food Stamp Program Social welfare TIAA-CREF Common Agricultural Policy Principal-agent problem 457 plan Social Security Trust Fund Elderly people in Japan West Island Line and South Island Line Edith Nourse Rogers Derivative (finance) Real estate developer Primerica Financial Services New Deal George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax Lottery Harold Shipman Nicholas Vansittart, 1st Baron Bexley Pyramid scheme David Blunkett Royal Mail Manifold

should you boycott the businesses of immigrants who are clearly not willing to integrate ie taxis off liscences restaurents etc and futher up the social scale if your government is doing nothing to stop the character of your society being changed by an influx of too many people who are not interested in becoming one of you but voluntarily want to lead a segregated apartheid like existence and will only entrench their separatist tendencies and become less interested in the wider community the more prosperous they become its your money apart from taxation you can spend it with any company you choose personally i have no problem with spending my money with the local ethnic groups i like curry and polish beer but seriously i would personally refuse to spend my money on any product group service i disapproved of financial organisations offer financial products aimed at specific groups with certain religious beliefs so why should you not do the same  Multiculturalism Ethical consumerism Tax Democracy Capitalism Coercion Microeconomics Racialism History of South Africa in the apartheid era Inflation Culture of South Africa Capital accumulation Zionism Keynesian economics Separation of church and state Economy of the United States Sexual orientation White nationalism Racism White supremacy Public education Security (finance) Jew Labour Party (UK) Corporation Commonwealth of Nations Publicly funded medicine Ethnic issues in Japan Euroscepticism South African Breweries Terrorism Johannesburg White separatism FairTax Social enterprise South Africa Constitution Life insurance Anti-Zionism The Left and Opposition to War Corporate governance Incentive Suburbs of Johannesburg Bank Civil rights Same-sex marriage Gross domestic product Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Reparations for slavery Public good Coloured Separatism Economy of India Singapore Chinatown patterns in North America Conservative Party (UK) National Health Service Common Agricultural Policy Acorn Computers Anarchism Surplus value Social justice Nationalism People's Republic of China Indigenous peoples Labor theory of value Homeschooling Liberal Democrats (UK) Free trade Irish Republicanism Public policy Baptist Religious Society of Friends East Germany Citigroup Wealth Economics Social Credit Status of religious freedom in France Segregated cycle facilities Caste Chinatown Militant Arturo Frondizi History of the Jews in Poland Libertarian socialism Same-sex marriage in Canada Conscription Tesco Cooperative Taxation in the United States Privacy Ethnic group Independence Party (Iceland) American Revolution Criticisms of socialism World government

any info on the switch from uk accounting standards to international accounting standards i'm doing an essay on the change from uk gaap to ifrs and was wondering if anyone had any info on this regarding intangible assets and goodwill as far as i can see both standards are the same and its really annoying me that i cant find any differences if anyone's got company examples that'd really help ifrs uk main differences indicator pls click on the link below goodwill is not amortised under ifrs instead ias requires an annual impairment review which should take place at the same time each year not necessarily the year end although if there is a trigger event subsequent to an impairment test being performed on goodwill then the impairment test must be updated uk gaap requires a review of goodwill at the end of the first full year after acquisition but then only requires such reviews when there has been a trigger event or where goodwill is amortised over more than years or carried indefinitely without being amortised where acquired entities are merged with existing operations frs requires calculation of the internally generated goodwill of the pre existing operation to facilitate a more accurate assessment of whether acquired goodwill has been subsequently impaired there is no similar requirement in ias a wider range of intangible assets are recognised under ifrs particularly in respect of business combinations see ifrs page under both ifrs and uk gaap an intangible asset is an identifiable non monetary asset without physical substance under ias an asset is identifiable when it is separable that is capable of being sold separate from the entity or arises from contractual or other legal rights under frs the assets have to be capable of being disposed of separately from the business frs requires an internally generated intangible to have a readily ascertainable market value before it can be recognised ias allows internally generated assets to be recognised provided they meet criteria similar to those contained within ssap for development costs internally generated brands mastheads publishing titles customer lists and similar items cannot be recognised as they cannot be distinguished from the development of the business as a whole ias does not contain a rebuttable presumption that the useful economic life of an intangible asset is years or less whereas frs does although both standards state that an intangible asset can have an indefinite life and if this is the case they need not be amortised both ifrs and uk gaap require annual impairment reviews for intangible assets with an indefinite life the requirements differ for intangible assets with a finite life ias only requires an impairment review if there is an indication of impairment whereas frs additionally requires an annual impairment review where the year useful life presumption is rebutted ias also requires an annual impairment review for an intangible asset that is not yet ready for use under ias research costs must be written off as incurred whereas development costs should be capitalised where particular criteria are met this contrasts with ssap where an entity may choose to capitalise development costs  International Financial Reporting Standards Intellectual property Asset United Kingdom corporation tax Microeconomics Trademark Inventory Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Vodafone Security (finance) Corporation Financial audit Corporate governance Insurance Microsoft Divorce Goodwill Contract Copyright law of the United Kingdom Windows 2000 Nuclear power Leasing Strategic management Mortgage Capitalism Corporate finance Capital asset Warner Music Group Depreciation Finance Mutual fund Tax Asperger syndrome Service Productive and unproductive labour Mergers and acquisitions Institutional fund management Islamic banking Manitoba Hydro Opportunity cost Intellectual capital Capital accumulation FairTax Political economy Intelligent design Trust (Law) USA Information Technology Infrastructure Library UK Singles Chart General aviation Monetary policy Publicly funded medicine Air traffic control Information Services Procurement Library Reliability engineering Xerox Income statement Law of value British nationality law Bank Clinical depression Surplus value Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Monopoly Geographic information system Autism Hypoglycemia PDP-11 Lloyd's of London Growth hormone deficiency Gold standard Information warfare Trade union Indigenous peoples Albert Medal Instrument flight rules CPU cache Constitution BAE Systems Accountancy Life insurance Digital photography Plame affair Drug test Sun Microsystems

why don't some stores accept credit cards why is it that many stores still don't accept credit cards i understand that there is a small percentage fee each time a transaction occurs via credit card i thought that many places would simply increase their prices a bit to adjust but it seems that the places that don't accept credit cards are more expensive if only by mere cents than those that do a convenience store near my apartment complex would have a great deal more business from me if they accepted cards i walk a lot and rarely carry cash i'm sure that many more people in the area have the same issue any ideas i guess it would be easier to fudge your taxes if all of your transactions are cash how is a girl supposed to pick a best response you guys all gave awesome answers thanks to all besides paying the fee a lot of small stores do not have the capital to finance their inventory waiting to be reimbursed for credit sales  Credit card Microeconomics Insurance Supply and demand Mutual fund Bank Taxation in the United States EFTPOS Internet fraud Money Wal-Mart Automatic teller machine Surveillance Mortgage Mergers and acquisitions Inflation Tax FairTax Citigroup Accounting methods Electronic commerce Credit card fraud Filling station Illegal drug trade Economy of Russia Extreme Programming Gross domestic product United Kingdom corporation tax Corporate finance Gold standard Student loan Advance fee fraud Keynesian economics Octopus card Social Security (United States) Collateralized debt obligation Life insurance Legal tender Bond Hyperinflation Dividend Loyalty program Monetary policy Betting (poker) Food Stamp Program Government debt Euro Personal finance Micropayment Bulk vending SmartRider Great Depression MetroCard Stock Futures contract Productive and unproductive labour Donald Trump Intellectual property Arbitrage Theory of conduct Wheel of Fortune CPU design Publicly funded medicine Capital accumulation Slot machine London Congestion Charge Primerica Financial Services Password Hash table Economy of India New Deal Capitalism Surplus value Islamic banking Small business Neopets Cable television Deflation (economics) Social rule Electronic money Education in the United States Game show Money supply Annuity Economy of the United States DVD Bank fraud Currency Arthur Laffer Wall Street Sears Holdings Corporation Consensus decision-making American Express RuneScape Random Events MapleStory

question about ebitda hi does ebitda only include main business profit or it includes earnings from other business operations like minor investment i often see telecom companies use this data in their financial report but seldomly see it's used in other industries why is that is it recognized only in telecom industry thnx no ebitda is a recognized figure in all industries most companies do not report ebitda in their financial statements but it can be easily calculated in case you didn't know this already ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization so ebitda net income interest expense tax expense depreciation expense amortization expense you may have to get depreciation and amortization from the statement of cash flows as far as minority investments are concerned if the company has more than ownership in a business the results are included in the companies consolidated financials ebitda or ebit is typically perfered by analysts as being more representitive of the companies operations and is better for forecasting and valuation perposes  Income Income statement Microeconomics Warner Music Group Depreciation Corporate finance Asset Amortization (business) United Kingdom corporation tax Finance Consumption of fixed capital Cash flow statement Mergers and acquisitions Personal finance U.S. generally accepted accounting principles Social Security (United States) Tax Operating surplus Mutual fund Surplus value Tesco Mortgage PE ratio Gross domestic product Financial analyst Insurance Airline Accounting methods Credit card Measures of national income and output Derivative (finance) Investment bank Leasing Citigroup Bank Economy of Russia Chartered Financial Analyst Faux frais of production Real estate appraisal Intermediate consumption Berkshire Hathaway Value product Life insurance FairTax IAS 22: Business Combinations Capitalism Corporation Dividend Productive and unproductive labour Capital accumulation Business Conglomerate (company) Wal-Mart Dot-com Security (finance) Debt Vodafone Taxation in the United States Lloyd's of London Free cash flow Nortel Networks Real estate economics Bond Capital gains tax Social Security debate (United States) Swap (finance) Financial statements Equity investment Market capitalization Institutional fund management Tax deduction Intellectual property Primerica Financial Services Venture capital Natural monopoly Monopoly Cable television 401(k) Enron Corporation Financial services Rupert Murdoch Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Monetary policy NASDAQ Creative industries BAE Systems Offshoring Annuity Renminbi MobileOne United States Postal Service

do u think dinar iraq currency is getting better any time soon my friend is buying dinar he's hopping soon that dinar is getting better that time he going sell his dinar and he offering me to do the same thing that's why i asking because i see at central bank of iraq website dinar is getting worse everyday but i know eventually dinar going to be better but is it going to happen soon well it has been on a good trend upward for a while now if it adjusts just pip every day the dinar will be equal to the dollar in short years is that likely no so probably more like seven years if the government makes the right decisions once iraq starts pulling in foriegn investment and produicing its abundant reserves it will continue an upward course and until it is on par with other oil producing countries in the region the country has a long way to go changing the infrastructure and the hearts minds and corruption of the residents is going to be equally difficult but essential in restoring iraq to it's former glory so yes it will go up but it will take a long time good things are worth the wait i hope for the people of iraq it does not take too long hopefully the country can do something like alaska does and give back portions of the oil profits to the citizens not just the greedy politicians and businessmen the easiest way to do that would be to revalue the currency placing more money in their pockets  Iraqi dinar Hyperinflation Inflation Monetary policy Gold standard United States dollar Money Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Kuwaiti dinar Privatization Currency Free trade Bretton Woods system Iraq Deflation (economics) Euro Microeconomics Gold as an investment Capitalism Exchange rate Asian financial crisis Gross domestic product Kuwait Economy of Russia Short selling Economy of Nigeria Economy of Kuwait Economy of the United States ISO 4217 Jordan Capital accumulation Hong Kong dollar Coalition Provisional Authority U.S. public debt Money supply Economy of Romania Marshall Plan Economy of Europe Serbia and Montenegro International Monetary Fund Foreign exchange market Gold Bank Bechtel Corporation Wealth Gay rights in Iraq Bond Political corruption Devaluation Economy of Serbia and Montenegro Romanian leu Iraq War Economy of Africa Economy of Iraq Economy of Pakistan Eurozone Say's law Economy of Tunisia Fiat money Liberty Dollar Supply-side economics Globalization Temasek Holdings Renminbi Economy of the Republic of Ireland Economy of Ghana Serbian dinar Federal Reserve Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 George W.

how does a wholesale auto dealer make money how do they make money by only selling to other dealers also is there anyway to sell to a retail buyer in or out of state can a wholesale dealer export cars out of the country thanks for any info a wholesale auto dealer makes money the same way as everyone else they are buying the vehicles cheaper than they are selling them for instance they may be buying cars in bulk from a supplier such as a rental car company and then fixing all of the scratches dents and dings and selling them on to small dealerships which don't have the buying power and only buy used cars at a time a car dealership can sell to retail buyers out of state but it can be a bit tricky sometimes as the license title and finance laws can vary from state to state if you are near the state line it probably makes sense to find out the details and obtain the paperwork to sell in a nearby state but that is allot of work for a state across the country where you may only sell cars not much experience in exporting but i don't see why it couldn't be done i know some countries are allot more restrictive than others for imports  Illegal drug trade Price discrimination Wayne Corporation Arbitrage Auto insurance Bulk vending GM Daewoo Inventory Tax Wal-Mart Trade Grey import vehicles Microeconomics Toyota Prius American Motors Cerritos, California Value added tax De Lorean Motor Company Internet fraud Studebaker Automobile Real estate broker Security (finance) US and Canadian license plates Sport utility vehicle Schwinn Bicycle Company Islamic banking Hybrid vehicle First-sale doctrine Daewoo Supply and demand Grey market Leasing Predatory lending Stock Yugo Capitalism Berkshire Hathaway Filling station Studebaker Lark Cadillac Bretton Woods system Carl G.

help me my girl and i ok we have been together for months and the first months have been so great i have never felt this good but the last month she has been growing away from me and i asked her if she still loved me and she said that she does just not the same though i am and she is we are in college together and yes the same classes we don't see each other as much she said that she wants to live her own life first and that all of her friends say that she should leave me because of my age i don't know what i did wrong all i wanted to do was make her happy and let her know she is someone special to me but she doesn't even say i love u anymore i don't want to break up but i am so confused right now what should i do we never have had a fight we have always been so in love with each other now it all has changed and i really don't know why that sucks man i really can understand what you're going through i don't mean this to sound mean or anything but consider the situation you're she is you're taking classes with a girl years younger than you you have a year old kid she is years old this girl is still a child herself even if the two of you were the same age and in the same situation i wouldn't be surprised if it didn't work out here's the bad news she is getting ready to break up with you about the only thing you can do to prevent this is to cool off yourself and don't do anything stupid like trying to win her over by being uncharactoristically nice just cool off and do your own thing for a while this plan probably won't work either this plan probably only has a in chance of working but if you do anything else you have a zero chance of it working out so you're starting to realize that very soon you will most probably be single again it's going to suck i'm very sorry dood i really am fortunately months is a short period of time you should be over it in another tops what are you going to do then start looking for girls closer to your age preferably ones who have children themselves i think you'll get along better longer with someone in a similar situation as yourself that's my advice good luck buddy i'm hoping for the best for you  Kodocha Avenue Q Jon Secada The Emancipation of Mimi Pitaten Shaggy dog story Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Social rule The Fairly OddParents Humphrey Bogart Spice Girls Incarnations of Immortality Theory of conduct Pok__mon Live!

is it ridiculous to ask management to help with transportation my girlfriend doesn't have a car and the management of her firm hired her over a year ago with knowledge of this well the person she was riding with recently decided out of the blue that she won't be giving her a ride anymore and apparently no one else at her work will give her a ride even those that live very close to us what i'm curious about is if you think it's ridiculous unethical or otherwise pointless for her to ask or expect her managers to assist in her getting to work please if you will answer this question with the assumption that my girlfriend is a valuable employee thank you for your responses we don't live in a large city by the way and public transportation sucks yeah ok let's drop the expect part because that's obviously not their responsibility but as the one guy said it's not unheard of for employers to help under certain situations i don't think that she should expect it but i also don't find it ridiculous unethical or pointless at all for her to ask if she is a valued employee and they knew her situation going in and they realize her situation now they will more than likely be happy to help her out in any way that they can perhaps they can recommend someone in the company for carpooling that she doesn't even know about if she is valuable enough maybe they will even foot the bill for a personal service such as a daily taxi etc i have even worked for a smaller company where management gave certain employees i e only the valued ones in need of course payroll advances to buy a car and then just deducted a small percentage of their subsequent paychecks to make up for it unless they are complete a holes some management types are but most are not i am sure that they will do whatever they can to help her and certainly will not chastise her for it be sure that she goes in somewhat humble with the approach of seeking advice not demanding a solution  Ethics Outsourcing Microeconomics Poker jargon Plame affair Avenue Q Meaning of life Expert system Annuity Public transport Social Security (United States) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Taxicab Supply and demand Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Wal-Mart Sudoku Labor theory of value Search engine optimization Boeing FairTax Health insurance Shaggy dog story Management Goodness and value theory Theory of conduct Friends Keynesian economics New Zealand Police Call centre Stock Tip Monetary policy Gender-neutral language Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Daredevil Economics Taxation in the United States Strategic management Extreme Programming A Course In Miracles Karl Rove Coercion GunBound Advertising 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines FedEx Corporation Life insurance Flat tax Epistemology Clear Channel Communications Theodicy EastEnders Social rule The Apprentice 2 Ambulance Freeters Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Divorce Best Buy Privatization Salary cap Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Philosophy of mathematics Monty Hall problem Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism One Tree Hill (TV series) Milton H.

what are the keys to successful team management i've just been put in charge of a team and feel a bit overwelmed i realy don't want to mess this up it is a very rare opportunity i believe the big challenge is to get them to work as a team many people are individually driven and the team thing is not always easy put the tasks out there and understand what the members different talents are how those talents contribute to getting the task done and how to get them to communicate effectively with each other the most detrimental situations i observed were when there were slackers soooo others ended up carrying a disproportionate portion of the load bosses that fail to correct the slackers cause negative attitudes with the productive employees so analyze your tasks and the talents of your team be on the watch for deadbeats and acknowledge the productive ones  Strategic management Theory of conduct Beavis and Butt-head The Apprentice 3 Extreme Programming Rational Unified Process Workplace democracy Transactional analysis Requirements analysis Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Leadership Reliability engineering Newcastle United F.C.

anybody currently working for live ops about how much do you make is it worth to pay for background check i just checked out live ops looks pretty legit just wanted some info from someone currently working for them it's probably worth the for the background check however i would think twice about the opportunity as a whole if you were to apply for a position in a real call center you would never be asked to provide money for their background check so although a startup cost is acceptable the reasoning behind it doesn't make you all warm and fuzzy about the company as a whole and that won't be your only upfront expense keep in mind that live ops requires you to subscribe to a separate landline phone through your phone company voip like vonage internet phones through your cable company and cell phones are not allowed this dedicated line is going to have an upfront charge for installation and will probably cost you month this is negligable if you plan on working hours a week making the estimated hr that a decent rep makes but if you plan on working less than that you should probably look towards a different opportunity  Voice over IP Telephone numbering plan Telephone 9-1-1 Broadband Internet access North American Numbering Plan GSM services Cable television Mutual fund Virgin Mobile Phreaking Blackjack Public transport Internet fraud Internet Private branch exchange Modem Bluetooth Surveillance Microeconomics The Amazing Race Advance fee fraud Verizon Wireless Ocean's Twelve Telkom UK telephone numbering plan Global System for Mobile Communications Student loan Credit card Payphone Teletext BlackBerry IP Multimedia Subsystem Digital Subscriber Line Telephone tapping Software patent debate Sprint Nextel Corporation WiMAX United Kingdom corporation tax Mobile phone Session Initiation Protocol Taxicab E-mail spam Estoppel Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks $ale of the Century Eircom Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Octopus card Home Box Office Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Walt Disney World College Program MMORPG IiNet MSN Messenger Light rail Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Life insurance Education in Australia Short message service Enhanced 911 Tertiary education fees in Australia FairTax Wal-Mart Graduate school Web hosting Corporate finance Food and Drug Administration Video game developer America Online Battery (electricity) Telephone directory Health insurance Telephone exchange Pretty Good Privacy Rogers Telecom Solar power satellite Federal Communications Commission Solar power Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Opportunity cost Chess strategy and tactics T-Mobile Toll-free telephone number Ra (board game) USA PATRIOT Act Winning Streak 7 July 2005 London bombings Open access Hard disk Subscription business model Acorn Computers Nuclear power Flat tax Optus XML

does anyone know where i could find a graph chart that shows the correlation between income and credit scores i am well aware that income is not factored into one's credit score what i am asking about if someone knows of a graph that shows correlation between income and credit score while there are certainly rich people with poor credit scores and poor people with good credit scores i think it is pretty obvious that there is at least a little positive correlation between income and credit score as people with lots of money can pay their bills much more easily than people with little money there should not be any chart like this income has virtually nothing to do with you credit score edit makeup of the credit score the approximate makeup of the fico score fair isaac discloses to consumerscredit scores are designed to measure the risk of default by taking into account various factors in a person's financial history although the exact formulas for calculating credit scores are closely guarded secrets the fair isaac corporation has disclosed the following components and the approximate weighted contribution of each punctuality of payment in the past only includes payments later than days past due the amount of debt expressed as the ratio of current revolving debt credit card balances etc to total available revolving credit credit limits length of credit history types of credit used installment revolving consumer finance recent search for credit and or amount of credit obtained recently the above percentages provide very limited guidance in understanding a credit score for example the of the score allocated to types of credit used is undefined leaving consumers unaware what type of credit mix to pursue length of credit history is also a murky concept it consists of multiple factors two being the oldest account open and the average length of time an account has been open although only is attributed to punctuality if a consumer is substantially late on numerous accounts his score will fall far more than bankruptcies foreclosures and judgments affect scores substantially but are not included in the somewhat simplistic pie chart provided by fair isaac  Credit card Bank Gross domestic product Microeconomics Bond FairTax United Kingdom corporation tax Money Supply and demand Economic inequality Taxation in the United States Deflation (economics) Solar variation Interest Inflation Capital accumulation Capitalism Debt Government debt Personal finance Sea level rise Economy of Russia Surveillance Intelligence quotient Normal distribution Student loan Health insurance Predatory lending Insurance Corporate finance Gold standard Life insurance Derivative (finance) Finance Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Credit history Economy of Pakistan Tax Money supply Publicly funded medicine Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Compensation of employees Free trade U.S. public debt Productive and unproductive labour Mainframe computer Electronic commerce Bank fraud Internet fraud PE ratio 401(k) Divorce GED Surplus value Monetary policy Economy of the United States Unemployment Tide Economics Credit derivative Cost of capital Trigonometric function Great Depression Extreme Programming Microcredit Fair use Fair Isaac Corporation Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Pi Corporation Social Security debate (United States) Law of value Second language acquisition Mutual fund Mortgage-backed security Polynomial Financial audit Intellectual property Derivative Welfare economics Graduate school Economy of India Yield curve Credit card fraud SAT Software patent debate Baseball

in an accepted draft for documents against acceptance what are the collecting bank's responsilities this question is related to the different modes of payment in the international trade transaction the question is raised since most banks claim that the collecting bank's role being an agent bank is just to relay the message of the importer and to remit funds when payment is made by the importer collecting agent banks have no obligation to force the importer to pay or settle its obligation to the exporter even if the importer has already claimed the goods imported it sounds like you may be refering to terms in a letter of credit most companies that do business on letters of credit require a confirmed irrevocable l c the importer does not get his merchandise until all the terms of the l c are satisfied the short version is the importer opens the l c in favor of his vendor the vendor ships the merchandise and presents the confirming read as collecting bank with all the documents necessary to fulfill the l c these documents include a bank draft payable at sight of the documents the confirming bank examines the documents to insure they comply with the l c and then advises the opening bank the importer's bank whether or not the documents are clean or discrepant the opening bank wires funds to the confirming bank provided the documents are clean and the confirming bank pays your draft while all this is going on the confirming bank has forwarded the original documents to the opening bank the most important document is the transportation bill of lading as that is legal title to the cargo once the importer has paid the opening bank he receives the bill of lading and he can then calim his merchandise from the carrier a letter of credit is a method of financing and is not a guarantee of payment to anyone a l c does not deal with the actual goods materials or services they deal with the paperwork and documents called for in an international transaction  Insurance Letter of credit Bank Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Contract Life insurance Annuity Mortgage Bretton Woods system Economy of Russia Article One of the United States Constitution Bond Tax United Kingdom corporation tax Credit card Trust (Law) USA Security (finance) Internet fraud Advance fee fraud Islamic banking Microeconomics Mail SCO-Linux controversies Money Legal tender Monetary policy United States Postal Service Gross domestic product Bill of lading Derivative (finance) Financial markets Economy of India Health insurance Credit card fraud Collateralized debt obligation Corporate governance Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Plame affair E-mail spam Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Gold standard Balance of payments Investment bank Fractional-reserve banking Bank fraud Primerica Financial Services Finance GNU General Public License Economics Copyleft Quarantine OpenDocument Octopus card Corporation Value added tax Financial audit Offshore company Financial services Constitution of Ireland Government debt Automated Clearing House Student loan Surveillance Corporate finance Accounts payable Banknote Great Depression Air New Zealand Public domain Institutional fund management Leasing Debt Mutual fund Economic relations of Japan Anarchism and capitalism Publicly funded medicine Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited Futures contract History of the United States Constitution Tax protester Stock Nuclear proliferation Capital accumulation Trade Electronic commerce Notary public Bank of China (Hong Kong) United Parcel Service Personal finance Data retention William Wakefield FairTax Social Security (United States) Oil-for-Food Programme

about new bankruptcy rules i understand that new laws are on the books about filing bankruptcy has anyone here tried to file recently and how did it turn out was it to your advantage did it help you wipe the slate clean of your credit problems or was it something you wish you had never done as the person above me stated it is required to attend credit education classed but there is a lot more to the new law as well but the new laws also eliminated the wipe your slate clean option it's all a re payment plan chapter where they garnish a certain amount out of your paycheck and pay all of the creditors that respond to the bankruptcy notice at a certain percentage usually it lasts up to years depending on the amount of debt you have you also have to get approval from the courts to obtain any credit or sell any assets you have it's very restrictive and takes a lot more work on the person who is filing's end the whole idea was to try and get people to be more responsible have to go through classes and actually repay some debt instead of just filing and forgetting about it  Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Bankruptcy Social Security (United States) Bankruptcy in the United States Bond Government debt Credit card Student loan Credit repair Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code Debt Annuity Mortgage Economy of Russia Corporation Taxation in the United States Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code Estoppel Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Appeal Enron Corporation Bretton Woods system United Kingdom corporation tax 401(k) Bank Divorce Deflation (economics) Microeconomics Supply and demand Interest Timeline of the Enron scandal Legal tender Stock Class action Social Security debate (United States) MCI Donald Trump Security (finance) Great Depression Law of value Developing countries' debt Gold standard Islamic banking Capital accumulation Dot-com Credit score Debt bondage Economy of India Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Derivative (finance) Fractional-reserve banking Tax SCO-Linux controversies Personal finance History of post-Soviet Russia Money Credit derivative Government of Maryland Bank fraud Marshall Plan Copyright Delta Air Lines Social rule Tertiary education fees in Australia Unemployment Flat tax Rose Garden Arena Public domain Incorporation (business) Patent Debt levels and flows Expert system Alexander Hamilton Leasing Tort reform Microcredit Publishing Computer virus Nuclear option (filibuster) Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Kyoto Protocol Federal Reserve 3dfx Inheritance tax Heather Wilson FairTax Mutual fund Northwest Airlines History of the United States (1918-1945) Mortgage-backed security Arturo Frondizi Federal Communications Commission Lawyer Unemployment benefit Collateralized debt obligation

i happened to see an accounting question on 'debit what comes in credit what goes out etc' my question is what would be the original explanation that made this rule of 'debit what comes in credit what goes out credit the giver debit the receiver debit expense credit incomde ' was this all by dumb chance or are there any good acceptable explanation behind at least one thing what i can't find an answer for as an engineer is when you receive cash your accounting books increase the cash account by debitting it the word debit comes from latin debt which means to owe so how would money received for sales become a 'debit' or are the accountants just use the terminology debit credit instead of saying enter on left hand side lhs right hand side rhs saying lhs rhs for me would be more sensible and less confusing any explanation to this please help me understand actually the words debit and credit come from the latin words debere and credere meaning left and right that's what they mean nothing else debit means left and credit means right assets are on the left side of the balance sheet they are increased with debits liabilities and equity accounts are on the right they are increased with credits income is increased with a credit because it is ultimately adding to equity expenses are increased with debits because they ultimately decrease equity when you make a journal entry the debits are always on the left and credits on the right this is not by accident debits on the left credits on the right here's a link for you to check out http learning swc hccs edu members paul brady overview html  Double-entry book-keeping Debit card Credit card Bank Personal finance Financial audit United Kingdom corporation tax Finance Asset Monetary policy Money Bond Accounting methods Liability Corporate finance Microeconomics Government debt Tax Financial statements Mortgage Mergers and acquisitions Contract Financial services Collateralized debt obligation Accountancy Money supply Debt levels and flows Internet fraud Deflation (economics) Income statement FairTax Warner Music Group Stock Security (finance) Schabir Shaik Trial Automated Clearing House Capital accumulation Depreciation Payroll Slot machine Automatic teller machine Cheque Bank fraud Model (economics) Life insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Gross domestic product Poker jargon Supply-side economics Derivative (finance) Money creation Surplus value Economy of Russia Article One of the United States Constitution Merit Credit card fraud Science Law of value Cost of capital Taxation in the United States SmartRider Electronic money Primerica Financial Services Betting (poker) Insurance Euro Interac Inventory Arthur Laffer Short selling Economy of India EBITDA Ford Motor Company Annuity Causality MetroCard Inflation Capitalism Balance of payments Hyperinflation Real estate developer Pension Federal National Mortgage Association Income trust History of the English Bible PE ratio Fractional-reserve banking E-ZPass Stored-value card Divorce Mutual fund Estoppel Left-handed Oral sex Small business $ale of the Century

i need to make us quick any ideas on how to make that money besides getting a job or selling stuff on ebay im a teen so something easy there are a lot of different ways to make money as a teen and just because you're a teen doesn't mean you can't get a job either my first job was at arby's when i was years old help out anyway possible and talk to your parents or whoever that you're helping about your goals and show them that you're willing to work towards them couple different ideas get a job if you're young visit your school office and pick up a child labor form and have your parents fill it out you can even get out of school early and earn school credit for having a job it's summer anyways you should have time for a job if you need the cash there's nothing like being young and making an extra a week or so when beforehand you were lucky to get that on christmas wash the car every week for a normal amount of mow the lawn set a normal rate and figure out with your parents how often the lawn needs to be mowed once a week twice the bigger the lawn the more can be bargained with if it's a smaller lawn then chances are you have neighbors that could probably use getting their lawn cut too change the oil and do a weekly pmcs preventative maintenance checks and services make a check list of everything you can think of about the car the headlights the horn the windsheild wipers the radiator the tires the oil the transmission fluid etc read the manual about the car that is in the glove compartment to get more ideas there's probably a checklist already in the back of that manual then go through the car and let your parents know when their windsheild wipers need to be changed out and offer to install them if you don't know what you're doing or need help get your dad to help you there's nothing wrong with that no one said you have to do everything by yourself this isn't only an extra opportunity to make some extra cash it'll get you extra points for when you want to buy your own car which is why i'm guessing you need the grand to begin with and it'll prove that when you do get your own car that you will be responsible and take care of it and your parents will be that much more compelled to help you meet that goal learn a trade like web design if there's anyone in your family that could use a website for their business it costs hardly anything to make one if you're mom's a real estate agent or something like that a website could help earn some extra cash it'll also add some bullets to your resume when it is time to get a job pack everyone's lunch before you go to bed and put them in the fridge this will save your parents some extra money that they'd probably spend on buying themselves and you lunch everyday instead why not give that extra money to you and take a lunch from home if you're any good at computers there's probably a good handful of people that you know that aren't very good at computers spend some time with your grandparents and teach them how to use e mail surf the web and basics like that if they're computer isn't up to snuff clean it up run some adware and antivirus programs and try to fix whatever problems that might exist it's summer time and people have their pools open go around the neighborhood and see if anyone needs their pool clean search the internet and learn up on how test the water how to add chlorine and how to do shock treatments make it a normal schedule like every tuesday and thursday morning at a m go to your neighbors' house and skim it before they're even out of bed let them know that every other week or so that they need to have their pool shocked and charge a normal amount to do that when it's time to close the pools make sure you're available to help them when they are ready to close it these are just a few ideas of what you could do just put some thought towards your goals and brainstorm ideas on how to accomplish them and then execute  Microeconomics EastEnders Inflation Insurance Wheel of Fortune Poker jargon Social rule Daylight saving time Extreme Programming Surveillance Education in the People's Republic of China Winning Streak Computer virus Theory of conduct The Apprentice 2 Malcolm in the Middle Windows XP Manual transmission National Football League Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Cruising (maritime) Avenue Q Neopets Wal-Mart Great Teacher Onizuka Betting (poker) Floppy disk Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Debugging Carburetor 2000 Australian Grand Prix Game programming Mutual fund $ale of the Century The Adventures of Pete & Pete Chevrolet Corvair Good Times Grandview, U.S.A.

my new shoes are very tight from the side any sugestions hi i buy this pear of shoes it is my size but for some reason it is tight on the side they didn t feel that tight before i buy them i got a very good deal therefore i don t want to return them also it was at a discounted store is there something i can buy that will help stretch it a little or is there anything i can do i appreciate the help thanks well i think that you should return the shoes and get a pair that is your size only it says wide because i think the problem that you are having is that you are getting the right size but they are not wide enough make sure that when you go to the shoe store ask for assistanc and tell them your problems and they will be able to help you another thing is that you want to go shoe shopping at the end of the day because if you do that then your feet will be stressed out and tired from being on them all day and that is the size shoe you will want to get they may be loose when you wear then early in the day but but by the end of the day they wont the problem with getting a shoe that is tigh on the sides is that they can cause a thing called a corn that really hurts good luck  High-heeled shoe Sock Horseshoe 1957 World Series Shoe Mattress Diving Upholstery Equine conformation Poker jargon Fecal incontinence Badminton Sears Holdings Corporation Dairy Social aspects of clothing Shoelaces Charles Goodyear About a Boy Retailer Customs and etiquette of Japan Eaton's Curling Drag racing The Beatles discography Escalator Pointe shoes Dr. Martens 2000 Australian Grand Prix Target Corporation Car handling Marilyn Monroe Indian English Quicksort Minor characters in Morrowind Tight end Fast bowling Sento Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Callus Glossary of American football Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters F.W.

calculation about ebit calculation about ebit i know ebit net income op exp can i use ebita dep amortization ebit thank you i presume you mean ebitda and not ebita ebit is an indicator of a company's profitability calculated as revenue minus expenses excluding tax and interest ebit is also referred to as operating earnings operating profit and operating income as you can re arrange the formula to be calculated as follows ebit revenue operating expenses in other words ebit is all profits before taking into account interest payments and income taxes an important factor contributing to the widespread use of ebit is the way in which it nulls the effects of the different capital structures and tax rates used by different companies by excluding both taxes and interest expenses the figure hones in on the company's ability to profit and thus makes for easier cross company comparisons ebit was the precursor to ebitda which takes the process further by removing two non cash items from the equation depreciation and amortization so if you wish to work backwards from ebitda to ebit yes you can add back depreciation and amortization to ebitda to get ebit ebitda revenue expenses excluding tax interest depreciation and amortization  Microeconomics Income statement Income Depreciation Measures of national income and output Gross domestic product United Kingdom corporation tax Tax Value product Amortization (business) Taxation in the United States Surplus value Operating surplus Economy of India Compensation of employees Inflation Life insurance Productive and unproductive labour Flat tax Value added Progressive tax 401(k) Economy of Russia Capitalism Mortgage Social Security (United States) Consumption of fixed capital Insurance Real estate appraisal Annuity Personal finance Linked list Credit card PE ratio Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 National Insurance Hash table Capital accumulation Intermediate consumption Derivative (finance) Bretton Woods system Cash flow statement Dividend Mergers and acquisitions Economic inequality Value added tax Sport utility vehicle Law of value Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Leasing Corporate finance Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Municipal bond Mutual fund Bond Cost of capital United States Postal Service Supply and demand Arbitrage Faux frais of production Money Model (economics) Creative industries Income trust Explosive material Social Security debate (United States) Real estate economics Economic rent Airline Fibonacci heap Wal-Mart Inventory Valuation (finance) Debt Property tax Ponzi scheme Divorce Salary cap Deflation (economics) Tariff Bank Tax haven Federal National Mortgage Association Present value Finance Royal Dutch Shell Dividend imputation Interest Alcohol fuel Economy of the Central African Republic
