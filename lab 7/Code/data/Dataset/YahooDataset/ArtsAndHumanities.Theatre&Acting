well i'm very interested in acting but i dont know how to get an agent margot klar do you guys have any ideas margot klar cunningham escott slevin doherty talent agency santa monica blvd suite los angeles ca talent agents for actors come in two main types theatrical television and film and commercial for commercials there are also dance print and voice over agents who specialize in these fields and signing with one of these agents can be a great way for actors with these other skills to cross over into one of the other areas being with the same agency for everything is called being signed across the board but many actors prefer to have separate agents for different types of work become some agencies might be strong commercially but not as strong theatrically or vice versa agents get information about auditions for roles either directly from casting directors and producers calling them asking for client submissions or from a fax email service called the breakdowns a daily list of roles being cast sent only to agents and managers although there is a black market for this information within the acting community and many actors without representation self submit for available roles which some casting people don't mind others hate and the owner of breakdown services abhors remember actors your agents work for you but they only get of what you make so that means you need to do of the work especially when you are getting started that means always be professional know your craft don't shy away from networking and letting cd producers and directors know about your accomplishments upcoming appearances by sending out postcards know your type and how you fit into the current market and above all make sure you and your agent are on the same page about what kinds of parts you will be submitted for and never pay an agent or manager up front to represent you they only make money when they make you money the plan of attack most agents refuse any off the street drop ins in other words they'll see new talent by appointment only don't bother phoning in for one just yet because without a face you're just another voice and unless that voice is absolutely incredible and the agent handles a lot of voice over work it simply won't get you in instead mail off your photo and resume along with a very special cover letter what makes that letter so special simple prove that you understand how valuable their time is so many people try cramming in their whole hopes and dreams autobiography into the cover letter it resembles a chapter from a novel the agent hasn't the time nor the interest to be a publisher any submission that takes more than seconds to scan through and read will likely be filed in the trash here's a sample of how to keep it short wannabe talent hopeful avenue dreamland bc attn ms a gent please accept my photos and resume for possible consideration of future representation i will contact your offices next week to verify your receipt of this package thank you very much for your time johnny smartguy that's it nothing else just plain and simple the agent even has seconds left to take a quick glance at your photo s and stats now the big trick comes the following week give it a full week before calling in and try to make the call on a tuesday or wednesday when they may be less frantic in the office just call up and say hi my name's johnny smartguy and i'm just calling to confirm you received my photo and resume chances are you'll get a response of the agents will be looking at it or there are no openings right now try back in a few months or even the infamous the agents will call you back if they're interested whatever the response simply answer no problem i don't want to take up your time i just promised i would make sure the package got there okay i don't want to keep you thank you very much for your time pause they'll either be impressed and relieved at the short conversation or they'll be caught so off guard that they'll try to explain further if they haven't said goodbye then just repeat a variation of your previous words always offering them the opportunity to end the conversation and reinforcing that you know their time is valuable they're so used to the can i come in pleading that you've really thrown them for a loop by not asking them for something call the better business bureau to see if any complaints have been made against the agency tips warnings agents making their living by earning a percentage of each job they book for a model do not pay any up front fees to an agent if you're not happy with the number of auditions or bookings you are getting set up an appointment with your agent and discuss what you can do to generate more jobs if the agent lies to you makes outrageous promises or asks for up front money to cover phone calls or mailing expenses on your behalf keep looking legitimate agents do not ask for expense money  Online Copyright Infringement Liability

acting plz answer i really want to become an actress but i am to scared to tell anyone in my family therefore i can't get any advise on how to get into the acting career please if you have any idea on how to get into the profession let me know thanks so much hi speaking as a parent i would be pretty disappointed if my kids felt they couldn't tell me about things that are important to them it might be tough but i would advise you to tell your parents anyway talk about it have a look a the answer i gave to a girl who wrote and said that she was having a difficult time convincing her parents to support her decision to become an actor first i'll give you a couple of free resources on my website for actors and then i will share with you the answer i gave to the girl who is probably around your age if you do a search here on answers you will see other answers to this question as it comes up usually a couple of times each day i answer this question a lot and so instead of writing the same or similar answers over and over again i have created an ebooklet that will give you a lot of intormation as to what you need to do to get started just go to http www actingcareerstartup com acs blog html sign in on the right side of the page and you can download it for free it's called what it takes to become an actor the second resource is about getting an agent although if you have no training yet then i doubt that you are ready but here it is anyway http www actingcareerstartup com how to get an agent html it takes you through a process that i used to get two agents and a personal manager in a short period of time in new york using the same process i also got casting directors to actually start calling me in directly for auditions and now the answer but i'll tell you something in a nutshell what could help you to feel more comfortable about talking to them about it is information here you go hi there what do you think would really make your parents start to take you seriously and support you do they know what actors do really do they know what it's like being an actor do they know what you really have to go through to become an actor do you know the answers to those questions do you know what it's like and what the issues actors face what it's like to work on set what your chances are of just getting work how hard you'll have to work how much you will have to invest of your time and energy to study to do mailings to write cover letters to submit yourself for auditions to prepare for auditions prepare your monologues bone up on your cold reading skills take specialization classes travel etc do you know what the average earnings are of an actor these days do you know how many days on the average an actor works do you know what it takes to become an actor and do you have what it takes have a look at the following links http www actingcareerstartup com to see some of the issues actors face while trying to get work http www actingcareerstartup com working as an actor html to see what it can be like day to day looking for work http www actingcareerstartup com a working actor html to see what it was like for me once on the set of an independent film that s just a start i strongly encourage you to talk to other actors both working and struggling as well it will help you in your education that's a lot of questions i know and i asked them on purpose why because if you can start to answer all those questions maybe you will be more convincing i know you're young but you have to get started sometime some teenagers have someone who is an adult and who supports them in their goals you don't so you can either keep butting heads with your parents or being afraid to approach the subject or you can start to find out things for yourself in other words the more information you have the more informed you are about what you say you want the more you can talk about it intelligently and demonstrate that you know what you are talking about the greater your chances of being able to convince them to support you if they havejust as much information as you do then you are on an equal playing field they are your parents they're bigger they're older they have the money they win at least until you re out of the house or until they no longer foot your bills is that the way you want it no then get a move on and start doing your homework does doing your homework mean that you will get what you want in the end not necessarily your parents are certainly taking into consideration your best interests but even if you don't get them to support you you will know a lot more than you do now about the profession you say you want to pursue good luck tony ceo http www actingcareerstartup com  World Wide Web Plame affair Divorce GED Avenue Q Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Scientology beliefs and practices Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Enterprise content management Milton H.

what can you do to vary the tone of make your voice more musical without sounding silly and artificial i dont have a flat monotone voice by any means but sometimes i have been told i sounded emotionally flat when i thought i was talking normally i suppose sometimes you might slip imperceptibly into an emotional rut and not know your there and this cant help but come across in your voice and i suppose if you do exercises with your voice that makes you sound more up and vibrant then that will feed into how you feel mood wise and how people actually perceive you when you hear a musical voice its engaging because it uncensored and fully committed to the content of what is being said the first thing lose your self conciousness about your 'flat'voice you know not everyone can 'do' that type of voice so don't edit it out completely keep it in your repetoire of many parts of your voice that you're developing also know that there's one sure way to make your voice more flexible and that's by being silly when you're practising you'll have to accept that to some people you may sound silly when rehearsing but those people probably aren't serious about being performers become aware of the pitch of your voice by sirening from as high then down to as low low as you can keep doing this over and over again play with all sorts of sounds not just speech humming and finding where your voice resonates most in your body and at what pitches you resonate most strongly try to feel the vibrations in your chest back throat cheeks and top of your head by playing with pitch and intensity become curious about how far your voice can take you and challenge yourself by building a repetoire of different voice types accents and characters if you do this in the privacy of your own bedroom bathroom cupboard for minutes a day when you're performing in front of others you've already given yourself license to take risks and people love to watch performers taking vocal physical and emotional risks keep daring yourself and try not to judge yourself too much good luck  Clarinet Timpani Violin Vowel Social rule Tone (linguistics) Stuttering Tonality Non-native pronunciations of English Weight training Harmonic series (music) Human voice Music Shaggy dog story Sound Speech synthesis Authentic performance Trumpet Jon Secada Synthesizer Flute Equine conformation Quarashi The Ashlee Simpson Show Friends Sound effect Blonde on Blonde Loudspeaker Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Fast bowling Definition of music Electric guitar Emotions (Mariah Carey song) Milton H.

acting agents in america how important is it to have an acting agent for theater work in the us in the uk you must have an agent to get any sort of paid work but i've read that only film and commercial actors in the states need agents what's the deal and how does one go about getting an agent in the states also can an actor work around the country even if their agent is based in new york for instance you can definitely start without an agent and you can get paid doing non union work though it will not be as much and it is less likely without an agent you will likely do student films indies that are non union theatre usually not paid but some are paid etc you can still do unpaid work with an agent especially if it's something you and your agent agree would be a good move a role that would be good for your reel or a specific person that would be good to work with etc yes you can work anywhere in the world with an agent regardless of where they are based if you book a job that's shooting on location in hong kong that's where you go however you may never be seen for a job casting and filming locally for instance in hawaii they may only be seeing people in hawaii for a film shooting in hawaii because they want to avoid travel expenses and per diem costs for theatre it's my opinion that you don't necessarily need an agent but once you get to be a certain caliber performer in that realm it can certainly help because not every casting will go out to the general public if you want to find a legitimate agent to represent you for commercials tv film go to sag org use the dropdown menu on the right labeled 'resources' and choose 'agent information' on the next screen on the left choose 'find a sag franchised agent' and follow the directions you can look up agents all over the us but there are higher concentrations where the work is los angeles ny il fl ga etc another great resource is ross reports especially because they update their info so often but not all of the agents they list are sag and you have to pay for the list that doesn t mean they re not legit but that s why i always tell people to start with the sag list it s free and those agents have signed an agreement to put the actor first www rossreports com if you subscribe to backstage com you can get a combo subscription which can come in handy but can also get quite expensive then you can send the agencies your headshot resume and a cover letter stating that you are seeking representation and wait to see if they call you in for an interview you never call the agencies directly that is a big no no at least it is in la please remember that reputable agents take exactly of your pay after they help you get a job not one cent more and not one cent before anything else is a scam this is strictly for talent agents not modeling agents or talent managers who take different percentages once you have an agent they will get you the auditions but until then you can check out actorsaccess com you can also see if your state has a film alliance commission society or whatever your state calls theirs some have more than one sometimes they post audition information for projects filming locally for theatre and other auditions on backstage you can go to backstage com or www actorsequity com click on casting call if you find the audition on the equity site you still may be able to go as long as their not taking appointments from equity actor's only on backstage com you have to pay to get all of the info but the initial search is free and you may be able to see enough info to find out the rest on your own without paying good luck  Screen Actors Guild Open access Plame affair Internet fraud Advance fee fraud Modelling agency MMORPG Online Copyright Infringement Liability

new acting job dilemma ok this is quite similar to my last question but it's an updated version so this question is more specific the story i have a backstage job at the moment touring with a show with a really good company i have just got an xmas acting job with another company the contracts overlap by days i have asked the new job to move rehearsal dates etc but there's no way the update i have had a proper chat with my current employers the options are finish the contract with them they are quite a good company and its touring theatres not schools and lose out on months xmas work and possibly be asked back next year to do a job in a skin costume i e dressed as an animal onstage or write a letter to my current employer terminating the contract leave my job days early to start my first acting job touring schools which is months long then definitely not be asked back by my current employer next year and possibly be stuck for work i'm very torn ultimately it comes down to what you see yourself doing in years time would you prefer to be acting or working backstage if you're passionate about both it sounds as though you have quite a bit of experience with backstage work and could benefit from some acting experience it may be worth taking that financial risk and cutting your teeth as a performer however if you aren't completely passionate about a performance career i'd suggest to you to keep developing your skills backstage and build your reputation as a reliable and commmitted crew member for your own peace of mind whatever your decision i'd keep everything above board and let your employers know your intentions from the outset although they may not be entirely happy with your decision your honesty and credibility will not have been tarnished directors and companies talk to each other all the time so a reputation is something to really think about regarding working in schools this is a great place to learn one's craft as the response is immediate you can't fool schoolchildren into being entertained and you'll be able to adjust your performance accordingly each time if you choose this route it may not be something you want to do for too long but it will be a demanding but rewarding experience remember whether your working in front or behind the backdrop if you were in it for the paycheck or the security you'd be better off working in a bank good luck  King Crimson Saturday Night Live Whose Line Is It Anyway?

how do i get start acting props to alex b for the info i can see that there those in the know here that try to help the masses of uninformed people asking about how to get started in acting i just wanted to add something that i think is important for aspiring actors to know even after you move to los angeles get an apartment study acting get your photos and resumes together you still have to get an agent i was recently doing business at a medium sized agency in la and saw the mail being brought in for the day my eyes almost popped out of my head there were thousands of yellow manila x envelopes when i asked one of the agents how many they get each day she just pointed at all the envelopes and said this is a slow day they have people working there who do nothing but sort through the submissions and they were telling me that they can't even open all of the submissions and many just get tossed in the garbage when i started out in this business back in my agent used to only get a few dozen submissions each day now there are so many many more people in la trying to make it and the number of new people coming into the city starting out far outnumber those who are leaving now even when you do get a sag card which costs plus annual dues and actually sign with an agent reality really sets in because you will be lucky to get or auditions a month and that does not include call backs and nd call backs things have changed quite a bit in the last years work is becoming more and more scarce not only because there are tons more people trying but also because there are way fewer shows to work on there is just a fraction of shows to work on now compared to years ago just look at all of the prime time game shows and reality shows and there are a huge number of productions and filming being done in toronto and vancouver now it's called runaway production and it is a huge problem in hollywood right now so as i have stated before i never try to discourage someone from chasing their dreams god knows i dropped out of college and chased my dream but i just can't stand to see people with these great false expectations and seeing them in so much pain and frustration after reality sets in i love people and i really love to see people happy and successful i am only attempting to do my part in getting some real information out there before people dive in head first and then realize there is no water in the pool peace out alan note to tony below i liked your link you have some very useful and insightful information plus you aren't trying to suck money from newcomers or give false hopes i admire that very much  The Inside Sharon Tate Wheel of Fortune Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Plame affair Economics Cordelia Chase Knots Landing Shaggy dog story Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Let's Make a Deal Kevin Smith Days of our Lives Hollywood, Los Angeles, California National Football League Toronto Blue Jays Past teachings of Prem Rawat Humphrey Bogart Spam (electronic) Oplan Bojinka New York Giants Jon Secada Battle of the Bulge 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Meat Loaf Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Gross domestic product 2000 Australian Grand Prix Our Gang Professional wrestling throws Theory of conduct Whose Line Is It Anyway?

how are people hypnotized i mean these stage shows where for example people are told to act out silly scenarios are they for real or are these people just playing it up for the audience i for one can't be hypnotized and it really annoyed the hypnotist as i made him look a bit stupid but personally i didn't feel anything not sleepy nothing is it all just a con trick nlp to me is the equivalent of brainwashing so i guess anyone can be brainwashed but i still can't be hypnotized or should that read manipulated it's not a con it's a show same with magic acts it's just good fun of course it's staged there are different kinds of hypnosis performed by psychotherapists but it's not very entertaining to watch  Hypnosis Derren Brown Neuro-linguistic programming Magic (illusion) Mind control Abduction Phenomenon John Grinder The Late Show with David Letterman Little Britain Confidence trick Whose Line Is It Anyway?

describe to me the typical sequence of events from the moment a director meets an actor to the start of the shoot also a little information on how that particular actor came to be the one there being interviewed or auditioned would be interesting ie are they friends of friends are they someone youve seen in a film or on tv and youve contacted their agent are they a bunch of actors a casting director has sent you that they think might be suitable basically what is involved in the selection process and what sorts of things do you do with the actors up untill shooting begins theatre gurl is right there are too many variants including all that you mentioned in your question it's too much of a discussion the platonic version would be that the production company gives the casting director a breakdown for each character to be cast they send those descriptions out through breakdown services and agents receive those breakdowns they then look through them to see who amongst their client fit the bill they submit to the cd pic res for the clients that fir the general descriptions and wait to see if the cd thinks that they might work as well if they both agree then auditions are scheduled if the audition goes well callbacks are scheduled depending on how many the cd needs to narrow it down to there could be a couple of callbacks before the director and producers are called in to see the actors read at this point there may be say actors to see for each role or only it really varies here the actors read the scenes and make small talk with everyone up until this point those in charge need to see if the actor can not only play the role the way they want but see if this is a person they can work with for an extended amount of time they're also matching you up with costars and seeing who makes the best couple or family or what have you sometimes you don't get a part because the other guy looked more like the mom or something like that it's nothing personal your final audition if it's for a pilot usually includes network execs that's kind of scary a bunch of people in suits and the atmosphere can be kind of stiff but you have to work the room they want to like you so let them get the idea  Sharon Tate Enterprise content management Filmmaking Friends Call centre Knots Landing Extras (sitcom) Scientology beliefs and practices Elijah Wood Little Britain The Inside Casting (performing arts) Financial audit Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus John F.

are you happy with how expressive your voice is or do you wish you could sound as charismatic as your favourite actor and have as rich a voice do you think your voice is just what you grew up with and its set in stone or do you think you can mould it into whatever you want it to be like voice is a strange thing it's all relative most people tell me that i have an amazing voice so much so that i'm able to pay my bills by working as a voice coach when i'm not acting but i've always wanted to have a bassier tone to my voice like ian mckellen your voice is not set in stone by any stretch of the imagination your voice can be almost anything you want it to be it just takes lots and lots of training a little patience and the help of a good voice coach to point you in the right direction but i've found that it's always best to learn to like your own voice train it so that it can be the best it possibly can but always make sure it's still your voice it's never wise to copy someone else in any form of art because then it's a imitation not an innovation your voice is a part of who you are embrace it and never be shy of using it  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shakespeare on screen Social rule Ranma __ characters Highway 61 Revisited Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Humphrey Bogart Violin Shaggy dog story Classical music era Ranma Saotome Infidels Music Novel Supply and demand Drama Colley Cibber Gandalf Empire Burlesque Rich Mullins Theory of conduct Duran Duran Counterpoint Magic (illusion) The Emancipation of Mimi Last Action Hero Storytelling Voice actor The Riordans John Cage New York Giants Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back Punisher House music The Fairly OddParents Blood on the Tracks Doug Ian McKellen Neuro-linguistic programming Britpop Okashina Okashi Autobiography (Ashlee Simpson album) Singlish John Peel Milton H.

casting couch with new comer is right or wrong yes no the casting couch acting and modeling can be a lot of fun it's a great opportunity to travel and meet a lot of really cool people what could be better but if you're thinking about acting or modeling one of the first things you need to know is that there are literally thousands of sophisticated scams and predators who specialize in preying on beginners in this industry they are the worst kind of bottom feeders and must be avoided at all costs if you are to survive the learning curve unscathed i can make you a star if you haven't heard that line yet you will yet most of the people who make that assertion can't do anything for you in fact i would immediately reject anyone who tells you that unless they are an agent with one of the major agencies a top level director or producer as you move up the ladder you are constantly going to run into people stroking your ego and fluffing your ambition insinuating they alone have the key to making you successful most of them will be saying that in an attempt to gain influence or something more you don't find jobs at clubs or parties you get jobs in offices what you find at parties is something else if someone tells you that they can get you in front of steven spielburg ask them who else they've put there and get ahold of that actor and ask them if someone tells you they work for calvin klein and help cast his underwear models ask to see their business card calvin klein is a billion dollar company with a massive marketing and advertising team they would never trust their billion dollar brand to an amateur or a friend of calvin these types of people might be able to get you other kinds of work but they'll never land you a campaign or a big film role the black dahlia is a grisly example of the potential dangers of prostitution as well as the difficulty in discerning who exactly is a prostitute beth short known as the black dahlia was murdered in although there is no evidence naming her definitively as a prostitute there was and still is speculation regarding whether she sold sex for money most agree that she was not a prostitute due to a vaginal deformity discovered during her autopsy rendering it impossible for her to engage in intercourse the black dahlia complicates definitions of prostitution however hollywood blurs the notion further with the casting couch the casting couch is when women exchanged sex for film roles or modeling jobs actresses and models are rumored to have used the casting couch method when in fact they did not and alternately women who did not consider themselves prostitutes did indeed agree to the casting couch to further their careers  Human sexual behavior Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Undergarment MMORPG Married... with Children Strap-on dildo Friends Pornographic actor Marilyn Monroe Robert Altman Microeconomics Supply and demand Avenue Q Insurance Bollywood EastEnders Advertising Epistemology Inflation Capital accumulation Sharon Tate Apple Computer Modelling agency Sin City Theory of conduct Arguments for and against drug prohibition Pornography Prostitution General relativity Advance fee fraud John Holmes (actor) Lauren Bacall Make money fast Chess strategy and tactics Citigroup Opportunity cost Little Britain Katie Holmes Sexual orientation Phone sex Economic inequality Sexual intercourse Extras (sitcom) Mail-order bride Diablo II: Lord of Destruction The Apprentice 2 Gucci U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Bank Tarot Boston Public Tom Cruise Calvin Klein Transactional analysis Mary Astor Showgirls Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Neighbours Knots Landing Veronica Lake Mensal__o scandal Sigmund Freud The Black Dahlia United States dollar The Catcher in the Rye Golf Software engineering MapleStory Jennifer Lopez Mergers and acquisitions Tesco Strategic management Birth control One Tree Hill (TV series) Kennedy assassination theories Consensus decision-making Social rule Pharmaceutical company Oral sex Minimum wage Comfort women Taxi Driver Corporate governance Labor theory of value Anal sex Exchange value Black hole Free trade Capitalism Economic anthropology AIDS

pleeeeease i need help ive been acting my whole child life in community theatre school plays etc and i think im ready to start auditioning for bigger roles can anyone tell me where to start my big acting career thx it's wonderful that you have that experience so many here don't have that you should absolutely look into getting an agent and if you want to find a legitimate agent to represent you for commercials tv film go to sag org use the dropdown menu on the right labeled 'resources' and choose 'agent information' on the next screen on the left choose 'find a sag franchised agent' and follow the directions you can look up agents all over the us but there are higher concentrations where the work is los angeles ny il fl ga etc another great resource is ross reports especially because they update their info so often but not all of the agents they list are sag and you have to pay for the list that doesn t mean they re not legit but that s why i always tell people to start with the sag list it s free and those agents have signed an agreement to put the actor first www rossreports com if you subscribe to backstage com you can get a combo subscription which can come in handy but can also get quite expensive then you can send the agencies your headshot resume and a cover letter stating that you are seeking representation and wait to see if they call you in for an interview you never call the agencies directly that is a big no no at least it is in la please remember that reputable agents take exactly of your pay after they help you get a job not one cent more and not one cent before anything else is a scam this is strictly for talent agents not modeling agents or talent managers who take different percentages once you have an agent they will get you the auditions but until then you can check out actorsaccess com outside of california and ny you can also see if your state has a film alliance commission society or whatever your state calls theirs some have more than one sometimes they post audition information for projects filming locally for theatre and other auditions on backstage you can go to backstage com or www actorsequity com click on casting call if you find the audition on the equity site you still may be able to go as long as their not taking appointments from equity actor's only on backstage com you have to pay to get all of the info but the initial search is free and you may be able to see enough info to find out the rest on your own without paying good luck  Screen Actors Guild Modelling agency Open access Internet fraud MMORPG Spam (electronic) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Plame affair Advance fee fraud National Football League Domain Name System Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Jackson 5 Cable television Divorce Marlon Brando RuneScape World Wide Web FairTax Unemployment Oakland Athletics Enterprise content management Slot machine United States Postal Service Lauren Bacall Advertising E-mail spam Corporate governance Child support Database management system Search engine optimization Minor league baseball Security (finance) Monopoly (game) Principal-agent problem Teletext Film Microsoft Karl Rove X Window System American Football League AmigaOS Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Church of Scientology Notary public Financial audit Open Directory Project Social Security (United States) Eric Bischoff Oil-for-Food Programme Mozilla Firefox Ombudsman Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Economics Government of France Oxford English Dictionary Digital rights management Mattress W.
