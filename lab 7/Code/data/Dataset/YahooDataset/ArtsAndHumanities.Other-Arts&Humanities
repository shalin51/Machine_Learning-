what specific criteria would you put in place increase the safety of women who r victims of abusive men alot of police treat this as just another domestic situation they don't take it seriously especially if they know the abuser i think when they report the abuse hit shove slap around beat they the victim should be protected the abuser should be taken immediately and placed in jail for days each time it happens and they are required to attend a anger management type program women are not given enough protection even if they have a protection clause when men overstep their court orders then put them back in jail each time longer than before and require each time an anger management program after a guy realizes he's gonna be jailed longer each time i think he will reform and if he's getting the anger counseling it certainly couldn't hurt him  Domestic violence The Inside Alcoholics Anonymous Divorce Involuntary commitment Plame affair 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Fred Phelps Fathers' rights Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Child abuse USA PATRIOT Act Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Unlawful combatant Columbine High School massacre Hazing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Rape Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) George W.

i write poetry and lyrics songs how do i get my work published and out there to be used purchased i love writing songs poems lyrics anything i believe myself to be very creative lyrically how do i go about breaking into that type of work publishing a book writing songs for artists things like that it's a tough world to work your way up through poetry is not likely to be very profitable for you even if you're very very good at it it's still a good thing to do and certainly is a wonderful means of self expression but its reward is more in the responses you get from those who read your work than it ever will be in cash song lyrics are another story there doesn't seem to be any particular way to get them out there effectively i think you just have to make it up record yourself singing it so folks can know what you intend it to sound like even if your singing isn't very good you don't have to sell your own voice in order to sell your lyrics add music to it if you're able i'd advertise it on a web site giving sample lyrics and offering more to those willing to enter into an agreement for them but you're not going to be able to demand that sort of thing right away it's the age old way of things one still must be discovered in this world in order to become successful at things such as these the more you get it out there the more people see it and the more people see it the more likely it is that one of them will like it enough to pay you for the right to use it for both their and your profit just be careful there are people who will try to take advantage of you and then there are people who will take advantage of you in that business you do have to learn to tolerate being used like that at least to a certain extent one need not be a total media whore of course but it's healthy to recognize early on that not everybody in the business is inspired by your work as much as they are by your income generating potential they will pretend to be impressed of course depending on how popular you are or how popular they think you might become but by and large most of them won't really be able to give a fig about you or your art they just want you to help pay their bills there aren't very many genuine people out there and that's a sad sad thing for serious and inspired talent good luck i hope some of this has been of at least a little use to you  Folk music Time Out of Mind Leonard Cohen Kylie Minogue Mixtape Poetry Rod Stewart Gross domestic product Apple Computer C__line Dion Aesthetic Realism Sampling (music) Nine Inch Nails Literature Hip hop music Insurance Bee Gees The Smashing Pumpkins Cantopop Music genre Boards of Canada Roxette Neopets Social rule Airline Joni Mitchell Grunge music Theory of conduct I Want to Hold Your Hand The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Karaoke Pop music Love and Theft Bringing It All Back Home Poker jargon Spice Girls Anne Rice Sacred Harp The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Roy Orbison Another Side of Bob Dylan Quarashi Aladdin (1992 film) Trademark Wonderland (McFly album) W.

who feed off who the entertainment industry often view advertising and the media as parasites feeding off the fruits of their labour but the entertainment industry use advertising and the media to sell themselfs and their work to to public it's more a symbiotic relationship i agree with you that they feed off each other however i think celebrities play a game of russian roulette with the press when they start out they seek the limelight posing here and there mugging for the camera hocking themselves to sell a movie or a tv show etc then once they 'make it' to stardom they decide they want to slink out of the very limelight they craved and demand their privacy and they have a right to that privacy however their idea of success is a two edged sword celebrities will never be happy especially in the bed they've made with the media now if the media would give press to movies and tv shows as opposed to the actors what do you think would happen nothing the washington post recently decided it was going to go an entire month without printing any story or news about paris hilton their paper didn't suffer neither did paris hilton in fact readers of the post barely noticed because there were so many other news sources catering to her celebrities created the monster they claim is a parasite how they deal with it is their own problem  Publishing Newspaper Advertising ITV Propaganda model The Standard UK Singles Chart Downing Street memo Neopets Public relations Journalism ethics and standards Paris Hilton Fahrenheit 9/11 Plame affair Tobacco advertising Media bias in the United States Copyright Television in the United States Saturday Night Live Apple Computer Privacy Celebrity Rick Santorum Am730 Alex Ferguson The Sun 24 (television) Surveillance Blog Public Broadcasting Service Spam (electronic) Publicity Delta Goodrem Google Retcon Fair use John Lott Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo MMORPG Movie theater Mass media BBC Killian documents Spyware Oxford English Dictionary Video game controversy Amiga Power Filmmaking Podcasting Jessica Lynch The Internet Movie Database America Online Ex-gay Internet troll Thomas Pynchon LiveJournal Roswell UFO incident Pornography Media in the People's Republic of China British National Party Kyoto Protocol The New York Times Jack Thompson 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Kylie Minogue Novel Manga Media bias Popular culture James T.

what makes your heart pound be creative this is going to sound odd but when i was young i came from a family situation that was let's just say not healthy and i was punished very severely for anything that went wrong in my vicinity whether it was my fault or not i won't get into some of the stronger details but you can use your imagination anyway to this day my heart pounds the hardest whenever there is an accident around me whether or not i am the one that caused it my pulse quickens and my adrenaline starts pumping and the fight or flight gets ready to kick in maybe it's the fact i was working on a diy and something simple happened like a drill bit broke or maybe it's something more severe like someone nearby takes a spill on their bike or skateboard of course now that i'm older i've prepared to deal with such things i know a lot of first aid and i know a lot about how to make repairs my rational mind kicks in and fixes the problem but right away when the accident occurs i still get the adrenaline push as if i'm about to be blamed and punished for it nobody but nobody can f someone up for life like a parent can  Theory of conduct Scientology beliefs and practices Cardiac arrhythmia Time Out of Mind Oh My Goddess!

french art get chosen for best answer what were cultural impacts of impressionism on france please be specific first person to give a plausable answer i e nothing stuipid gets best answer impressionism explicitly rejected the culture of official art in france i e academic art which dominated the salon exhibition spaces instead of being exhibited in the salon impressionist artists staged their own outsider exhibitions thus impressionism directly challenged the official salon system impressionism the best of it made modern life a viable topic for representation impressionist artists frequently turned to themes of modern urban life and often showed the gritty underbelly of it alienation in a marxist sense and the chaos of modern life the relatively small scale of many impressionist works of art redefined the market vale of art in the nineteenth century and profoundly impacted habits of collecting art paintings were no longer enormous think david courbet but were now made to sell in the gallery space for rich bourgeis collectors many of them american your question about impressionism's impact on france should be rethought it's a bit problematic to only think of impressionism as impacting the culture and not the other way around you also should consider how the culture of france at the time impacted impressionism this art movement did not just emerge out of nowhere it's even more interesting to think about the various forces that caused it to emerge  Modernism Academic art __douard Manet Impressionism Surrealism French literature of the 19th century French art salons and academies Gustave Courbet Kitsch Western art history Paris Salon Postmodernism Music genre Martial art Capitalism Michel Foucault Intelligent design Head of state Modern art Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood Walter J.

why does this seem so deep and interesting to me it was weird at around pm last night on a whim i just decided to rearrange my bedroom in record time i tore everything apart moved everything had everything set up completely differently this is the first time in many many years my room looked the least bit different right away i decided i didn't like it so as fast as i rearranged everything i put it all back exactly how it was not an easy feat considering how much stuff i have and how small the room is for that brief minutes tonight my room was as it has never been before and then now it is back to how it was for the past few years no one in my house even knows i did it either they could walk in right now and see it and never know for that short amount of time it was as they never saw it before why would i see this as something that is so deep because you can't know how something really is until you're really open to the experience it's one thing to ponder it then dismiss it it's quite another to fully contemplate it and examine the possibilities even if you return to your original decision it's kind of like religion most people will assume what they believe to be the only way few people will actually feel secure enough in their beliefs to be open to someone else's faith perhaps they are scared if they did they could never go back  Shaggy dog story Time Out of Mind Milton H.

write something creative irma ladeux she looked longingly at his picture as she grasped it between her slender fingers how long had it been in mandy's mind anything more than minutes was monotony my god she cursed to herself i feel so anxious and so warm better stop looking at chad's picture thoughts coursed wildly in her mind and created both excitement and apprehension in every part of her she nervously shoved his photograph back into the envelope there was no time left for thinking now mandy defiantly flicked long silken strands of hair from her cheeks causing her blonde tresses to blow like ribbons in the breeze furtive glances at her watch confirmed that time was indeed passing slowly almost two she sighed impatiently and forced her glance into the distance he should be arriving soon as mandy's thoughts echoed in the vastly empty expanse of her cerebral cortex she stood facing the endless avenue gazing idly at the vista of wheat fields in the distance the tall grasses danced sensually responding to the light breeze with little effort this lazy scene only increased mandy's tensions in moments she expected chad's car to stop in front of her and she would once again embrace him thwack came the resounding thud as the book fell to the floor mrs irma johnston shifted her position on the uncomfortable seat as the bus rounded a corner too sharply this particular september day was so hot and so steamy sweaty people crammed in the aisles struggled to prevent spilling on top of each other with her stop now in sight she silently sighed to herself and reached onto the floor to grab the novel shoving it into her large canvas bag that's enough of that for one day she decided firmly to herself i've really got to stop buying these cheap romance novels not proper for a woman my age to daydream and with that the bus came to a grinding halt the elderly lady trudged laboriously to the door and exited unnoticed it's never too late to daydream the woman reflected as she plodded on irma finally arrived home slightly puffed out by the cumbersome shoes and the long walk in a warm autumn sun surprisingly she unlocked the front door effortlessly and spryly walked inside sunbeams danced gaily on the walls of the hallway illuminating the mirror in the entryway reflected there was a disheveled older woman with shaggy gray hair and matronly clothes with a pronounced gesture irma threw her dark coat aside and removed the heavy shoes from underneath the now cast off facade she blithely wiggled her slim legs and pranced jauntily into the kitchen a profusion of light hit her full force and displayed her truly ravishing features well irma she said wryly to no one at all i have most certainly come a long way so glad to rid myself of that ridiculous disguise she tossed the matronly clothes casually to the floor revealing a comely outfit of black silk her slim figure and long honey colored hair escaped effortlessly from the captivity of the gray wig as she reveled in her welcome freedom undercover work was tedious kate was consummately attractive successful and undoubtedly in high demand but this was not surprising to anyone who knew her bright beautiful and bored she secretly knew that she was slowly turning into an asshole hmmph to that she mused mischievously and tossed her handbag onto the sofa with careless aplomb kate idly toyed with the canvas bag with playful curiosity what could mandy be up to now she wondered almost aloud she delved into the bag and retrieved the book mandy narrowed her eyes in the brilliant afternoon sun as she surveyed her surroundings chad should be here by now and soon they would be together once more she played with a stray wisp of hair as she mindlessly dipped into her bag for lip gloss applying it liberally she glanced at her reflection in a compact mirror and smiled seductively as she imagined their first moments together again and then later back in her apartment when they were truly alone she recreated this scene yet again as she had done a million times anxiously looking at her watch for the umpteenth time she sighed loudly at the words of that tiny inner voice ha late by nearly minutes she scrutinized the horizon her truly impatient nature took form in her defiant glances behind her she blinked rapidly at the familiar row of houses dotting the avenue and the comfort of her home territory quite a contrast to the open road ahead mandy's consternation was suddenly interrupted but not chad's blue camry instead it was a low sporty model the rag top was down from behind the steering wheel a very attractive man effortlessly maneuvered the vehicle the car came to a stop scant feet from the tip of mandy's gold high heels hey kid how are you long time no see he smiled gallantly his provocative eyes sweeping the entire length of her well proportioned form hop in let's go for a ride mandy knew that justin lusted after her but she had rebuffed him solidly ever since stupid chad had reappeared on the scene just a few short weeks ago for a moment she cast her eyes directly into his dreamy brown ones she very nearly wobbled on her heels but recovered quickly never once displaying any vulnerability one last perfunctory look past him to the empty road beyond confirmed mandy's thoughts no chad where the hell was he with her voluptuous lips instantly changing from a puckering pout into a devilish smile she finally spoke to justin meanwhile on the other side of the mountains chad was having yet another one of his misadventures in his never ending efforts to be on time clutching a now empty biggie sized quickie mart soda cup he clumsily fought his way out of the hissing car and turned his back on the steaming radiator what will mandy think of this he grimaced as he scaled the out of the ditch he tediously made his way towards a small creek he remembered seeing some miles back in the clean air of solitude he started to replay the events that had created his predicament how could this finely tuned well loved car suddenly betray him stranding him in the middle of nowhere his mind was thick and his head thumped loudly from last night's romp at the chalet why was justin so chummy what the hell was the name of that drink he bought me mandy peered through heavily mascara laden lashes and blinked in vacuous fashion at justin's disarming smile reaching for her lip gloss again she artfully applied yet more this time more liberally to her coquettishly poised lips all the while returning his flirtatious glances with a long heaving sigh chad in his unerring lateness was yet again fading fast from her limited memory in the heat of the moment mandy's words froze like the spider to the fly justin leaned over and opened the passenger door invitingly mandy now fully glossed hesitated for a scant second and then seated herself beside him as she was slowly and seductively enveloped within the leather interior the sensuous aroma of his new car combined with the relentless heat made her mind such as it was spin with muddled thoughts of anticipation wordlessly the pair drove off in a haze of dust kate read on with rapt interest oblivious to day night and time itself  School bus Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Baseball Fitz Hugh Ludlow Humphrey Bogart Mercury 4 The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases

is my short story any good the door slammed shut jarring the doorframe i stared absently out the window watching the headlights cut a path through the night air i choked back a stream of tears and let out a long ragged breath my dog lay at feet his chin resting upon my toes his breaths slow and steady tears continued to flow down my cheeks despite my best efforts to control them at that moment i seemed unable to control much of anything the world was falling apart around me and all i could do was sit and cry careful not to disturb my dog i slipped my feet out from under him i curled my toes into a tight ball and ran them along his back then his ears he looked up at me expectantly his tired eyes expressing a deep sadness i knew he was in pain we both were i sunk to the floor and curled up beside him pulling him close to me at that moment i began to pray i don't really believe in god but i prayed nonetheless please god if you're your listening let him live another day i consider myself an amateur writer please let me know if you think this is at all worth persuing i realize that is intentionally vague but would appreciate any feedback overly descriptive without much plot movement  Shaggy dog story Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation Diving Aerial (dance move) Boxing Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Toilet humour Glossary of nautical terms Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Dog training Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tenshinhan Backstroke The Shining (film) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Amber Spyglass Night (book) Futurama (TV series - season 4) Jon Secada Professional wrestling throws Sin City Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Humphrey Bogart Cat Tetrapod Fast bowling Milton H.

help with art volunteering program i am a volunteer at an art program in a hospital i am asking this question to find out if anyone knows any great activities i can do with the visitors of my period any information you can give will be helpful thank you in advance the age group of the participants are from to they are of every race and most aren't religious they are quite capable of preforming artistical even though they have mental illness they are also very perceptive painting is the obvious one my least favorite craft for any group is where is person is given the same item to paint or decorate it just seems so trivial like when you trace your hand on a piece of paper and decorate it like a turkey for thanksgiving i just don't think that's all that creative you could also do something like a memory quilt or mobile each person contributes one item to a group project pieces of cloth uniform or not can be decorated by each person in whatever way they see fit and then they can be sewen together each square is like an individual story from each individual you could change this up a little by having everyone braid cloth and little objects that they like or are significant to them into their own individual braids or strands then you can turn it into a mobile i'm borrowing those idea from others i've never done them myself  NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt Art Clothing Textile manufacturing terminology Quilt Braid group Boy Scouts of America Hypnosis Modernism Pottery Knitting Pre-historic art Society for Creative Anachronism Symmetry Milton H.

could you please proof read this yes it is a question as in will you or not to me my puppy is more then just a pet she is my fur babie many people in the us feel the same way and while there are always the lovers there also comes are haters just because i may not mind being seated seated next to a dog many people would mind i think it would be ok to allow owners in with there dogs but within a limit there would be a few things the pups would need first the dog would need proof of rabies shots for two reasons first if something were to happen the dog would have the rabies shot so that would take a big relief off the person s who got bit second in case a dog got bit by another dog or by another creature the dog would need a collar harness with a leash attached at all times to prevent the dog getting away or bothering other people rest will come in a secound there are also things the restaurant would have to do so they could keep old costumers and get new dogie costumers the restaurant would need to have a dog section and a non dog section many people have fur related allergies and would like to be sat in the non dog section while others would just not like to dine with dogs while people who have a dog or like dogs could sit in the dog section they would also have to provide a 'potty' spot for the puppies yes dogs droll and dogs scratch and dogs make messes but any true dog lover could get past that and any willing restaurant could get past that too because the fact of the matter is that if a restaurant gos the extra mile in making a place where you and you puppy can dine while others can dine perfectly without being disturbed by the dogs they are in for a lot of money making just like when restaurants started to make smoking and non smoking sections uh i dont have spell check hense why i asked you guys to proof it personally i think the idea is dumb and there are many health department reasons that would make this idea never fly i'm sure i didn't get everything but here's my edit basically you have sentences that are too wordy many misspellings too many and some statement don't make sense my puppy is more then just a pet she is my furry baby many people in the us feel the same way while there are dog lovers there there are also dog haters i may not mind being seated next to a dog but many people would i think it would be ok to allow owners to be there with their dogs but there must be limits for example the dog would need proof of rabies shots if something were to happen and a person or another dog was bit evidence of being current with vaccination would be a big relief the dog must wear a collar or harness with a leash at all times this is to prevent the dog getting away or bothering other people there are also things the restaurant would have to do so they could keep old costumers and get new dogie costumers the restaurant would need to have a dog section and a non dog section many people have fur related allergies and would like to be sit in the non dog section others would just prefer not to dine with dogs people who have a dog or like dogs could sit in the dog section they would also have to provide a 'potty' spot for the puppies outside yes dogs droll and scratch they make messes but a true dog lover could get past that and any willing restaurant could get past that too if a restaurant goes the extra mile in making a place where you and you puppy can dine while allowing others to dine without being disturbed by the dogs they could be making a lot of money  Dog training Rabies Dog Ferret Pet skunk Docking Gray Wolf Theory of conduct English grammar Cat Hamster Dog collar Whose Line Is It Anyway?

creative block how to get out of it when i was writing came very naturally to me and i did not need to search for ideas since then i've had a massive creative block and haven't written anything for pleasure in a couple of years i'm nearing my th birthday and i want to rekindle the passion any ways to spark inspiration that maddening kind where you couldn't stop if you wanted to i miss it so i think part of it is fear that i'm no good teachers would compliment my writing and instead of being motivated it made me set standards i could not reach it made me too nitpicky about getting it perfect that i wouldn't write freely dear ha writer's block can strike any writer at any age and oftentimes repeatedly what you need to do is forget the standards you've set and find your muse again that inner creative voice that speaks to your right brain do something fun like the first answerer said enter some competitions submit your work to some magazines and ezines that only accept submissions from teens i'll post some links for you enter the scholastic art and writing awards if you're a us citizen it's open to all students grades if you just sit down and start writing and don't give up until it's done the passion will come back and the ideas will flow again i'm a published author of books and my rd is getting ready for release when my dad died i felt like i would never write again it took me nearly a year to start writing what i did was i went to the park and people watched then i picked certain people gave them names and personalities and wrote paragraphs about why they were visiting the park if i saw a couple then i wrote what brought them to the park it was a great exercise that eventually led me to a short fiction piece that won a competition it was what i needed pick a short writing exercise that you'll have fun with and make sure you follow through with it once you finish one story more will come if you give in to the writer's block it will only grow more and more difficult to defeat work on defeating it before it wins good luck to you o  Milton H.

is there a way to preserve a tooth that was extracted by a dentist a couple of years ago my dentist pulled out one of my canine teeth i saved it though and was thinking of having it encapsulated in a clear but durable plastic material and then make a pendant for a necklace you see if shark teeth and other light objects can be made into pendants what more for one's own but then i don't know where in the valley los angeles i could go to for such a purpose my friends really balked at this weird idea of mine or so they said any ideas i've heard of mothers saving their children's baby teeth and creating necklaces with kids i'd have quite a collection can't imagine wearing one of your own teeth would be weirder than that i would think a dremel drill or other tiny drill bit would make a hole to string it or go to a craft shop and find a metal cap in jewelry making supplies to glue to the top of the tooth then wear it on a chain maybe you could recycle old braces and make one  Drill bit Dental brace Tooth Money Screw Turquoise Guitar Shark Dental caries Dental fillings Dentistry Printed circuit board Woodworking Pearl Solar cell Casting Barque Netsuke Filigree Bong Crown (dentistry) Naval mine Clothing Polymer clay Wire Tyrannosaurus rex The Fairly OddParents Gramophone record Leather Chainmail Perl Orthodontics Disc brake Knife Textile manufacturing Internal ballistics Seismic retrofit Drill Bruxism Sonic Adventure Hand grenade Toa Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories The Amber Spyglass Characters of Naruto Doug Upholstery Shen Gong Wu Borehole George Costanza John Lennon Ammolite Drizzt Do'Urden Troll Violin Ceramics San Jose, California Hitler's death Dog Rave party Lute Hip hop fashion Gold Piano The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap Carburetor Mario Frank Zappa Petroleum Tetrapod Human evolution Happy Tree Friends Sundial Radio controlled airplane Iron Glass Canoe Waste management Rave Master Skateboard Motor oil The Dentist Dil Pickles Tooth enamel Neanderthal Ice core Land mine Black hole Conan the Barbarian Polystyrene Orichalcum Guinevere Jones Eric Cartman Singapore Police Force Sharon Tate

child models does anyone have their child in modeling like for print work or commercials etc my daughter is with an agency but i can't help thinking it's a rip off because we paid a pretty penny and so far nothing it seems like a legit agency but i am thinking they endorse they favorites and leave the others out in the cold my daughter is cute and not shy at all and would do well if given the chance i just want her to have a better and easier life than myself and not have to work so hard i'm in portland or and have looked for other agencies and i don't see them what a great mom that you want a better life for your daughter as a teacher i've seen a lot of younger girls develop eating disorders and the probability of child models developing them is astronomical so please just keep an eye on it maybe try and find some studies and evaluate how likely her chances are of making it i know how fabulous that would be though o versus her feeling like her main worth is extrinsic superficial it's a very tough call for you i'd imagine best of luck with whatever you decide  Kodocha Asperger syndrome Poker jargon Okashina Okashi Knots Landing Arianne W.I.T.C.H.

do you like writing with a sharp pencil i have several pencil sharpeners and i use them regular because i like to write with pencils do you know what i mean i like writing with ordinary pencils too but obviously only for personal use they're so cheap and simple and biros don't always work if you're half lying down and have them at a funny angle and they can suddenly go all smudgy on you when you don't feel like getting up and looking for another incidentally i have some old family postcards dating from the long ago pre biro era which went through the post written in pencil so trusting somehow that was when the only alternative was those dipping pens or fountain pens and if you'd run out of ink or didn't want to get messy pencil was presumably the only other option i think there's something comforting about pencils too because they're what we all started out with in our earliest school years although it can look a bit pale sometimes i find an 'h' grade quite good because you don't have to sharpen it as often  Ballpoint pen Fountain pen Pen Drawing Autograph Writing GED Jim Aparo Runaways (comics) Typewriter Comics BIC Corporation Knife Drill bit Pencil sharpener Desk Pen and ink Dip pen Piccolo Junior Saga Milton H.

how do you get into the modeling buisness i want to become a model my top few choices would be victoria secret juicy couture places like abercrombie but how do i get started well miss cali i have been a professional commercial photographer and a certified model consultant for a long long time and bring a word to you on this front that comes from experience and knowledge this is my business there are three things that are a must here besides the main thing of having great looks that photograph very well and those are as follows one must have at least the basics of a portfolio together this is the actual proof of photogenic ability and even though the digital portfolio is beginning to take the day the call for and acceptance of the printed version of this set of photos is still the standard this must be to x 's in a binder that are as absolutely different from one another as is humanly possible it should contain at least some black and white as well as color should have some studio and some location shots some of casual as well as more formal and the absolute necessary bathing suit shot makes no difference one or two piece one can pay quite a bit of money for such a presentation but it really isn't necessary to break the bank here one by going slowly and methodically can do this on a budget over time with far less expense than most people think next is to get at least some experience in front of people or in print ads to have as a reference for a resume beginning there are a lot of places that this can be accomplished local shows are conducted by specialty shoppes and shopping malls on a regular basis and the co ordinators for these events are always looking for new great looking people for their shows and are willling to give people a chance to get experience in exchange for their efforts here third and one of the most important finding an agency or representative that isn't a scam artist there are thousands of them out there they say they are agencies but their real job is to sell you classes and high dollar portfolios my suggestion here is to talk with actual clients of any agency that you are considering or that is considering you and i don't mean people that they have working for them i mean actual people who have found work through them or people who use them for people in their ads ect wish i could personally school you here there are a lot of nuances within this field that are to be learned and a lot of things that you could benefit from knowing but alas the time and space constraints of the y a the best of luck to you in all of this hope to see you on the printed page some day in the near future i am a regular contributor to a number of fashion publications myself and who knows one day we might get a chance to work together  Photography Advertising Plame affair Insurance Inflation Microeconomics Gross domestic product Social rule Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theory of conduct Ra (board game) MapleStory Economics Apple Macintosh The nature of God in Western theology Modelling agency Cheating in Counter-Strike Neopets MMORPG Doomsday argument Economic inequality Capital accumulation Mutual fund Mach kernel Advance fee fraud View camera Spanish verbs Monopoly (game) Undergarment Software engineering John F.

middle medieval ages why is the middle or medieval ages considered as a dark period in time the middle ages can be roughly classified as covering the period from the th to the th centuries most scholars classify the early period of the middle ages perhaps from the th to the th centuries as the dark ages primarily because economies were simple with little influence of banks the relationships between kingdoms was often marked by violent conflicts religious groups that were often in control of government ruled by ancient traditions disregarding real needs of society and information was held tightly by the elite since the printing press did not come into common use in europe until about this made europe dark from lack of trade and commercial development uncivil methods in international relations disregard for leading scientific discoveries that seemed in conflict with religion and dark from lack of information dispersal it was primarily the geographically broad and sociologically enlightened influence of the roman empire previous to the middle ages that provided the contrast that allows us to see the early middle ages as dark  Middle Ages Dark Ages History of science Feudalism Italian Renaissance Academia State History of Europe Sociology Palestinian History of the World Karl Marx Jewish history Western world History of science in the Middle Ages Protestant Reformation Age of Enlightenment Chinese language Republicanism Sociocultural evolution France in the Middle Ages Ottoman Empire Civilization Science Ancient Greece Early modern warfare Middle Ages in history Bible Medieval music Renaissance Encyclopedia Jew History of India Coercion Israel Roman law Late Antiquity German Confederation Political science Famine Sephardi Jews Jews in the Middle Ages History of literature Mercantilism Ashkenazi Jews International law Roman currency Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus War Christianity Judaism Non-governmental organization History of Christianity Ringfort Ancient warfare Biology Pharisees History of Germany History of theater Black (people) History of Iran Social class Western Roman Empire Military history History of philosophy Law of value Zionism Tamil people Turkic peoples Inflation Protestantism Same-sex marriage Age of Discovery Persian Empire Philosophy Media bias History of British society Assam Middle kingdoms of India Geography Medieval art Cultural and historical background of Jesus Economy of Africa Printing press Goths Medieval French literature Ancient Egypt Max Weber Cult Technology Esotericism Industrial Revolution Modernity

what is the difference between the aboriginal art of the past and the australian art of today if this question is responded soon it would be very thankful of you mm sometimes you will get silly answers from people who do not have a clue there isn't much difference when the aborigine did his art before white man came along his canvas was usually a bark from a eucalyptus tree using ocres of various tone charcoal and white lime chalk applied with small trigs or sprayed from the mouth with spit all the paintings are stories of the dreaming each tribe have dreamtime stories and anyone wanting to do a dreaming painting usually has to have permission from the tribe that owns the dreamtime story these days it is not unusual to see the same stories on canvas another thing that may be of interest in the modern aborigine art if a tribe member becomes famous for his dreaming stories other male members will help him in his name to produce more everything an aborigine does is as a collective nice question  Indigenous Australians Eucalyptus Australian Aboriginal mythology Dreamtime (mythology) Art of Australia Shaggy dog story Drawing Cooktown, Queensland Prehistory of Australia Didgeridoo Tasmanian Aborigines Salvador Dal__ Paint Piet Mondrian Yagan Francis Bacon (painter) Art Marree Man Christmas tree Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Surrealist techniques Wassily Kandinsky Emily Kngwarreye Modernism Albert Namatjira Totem pole Storytelling Noongar 50 First Dates Bart chalkboard gags Cleopatra VII of Egypt Cubism All Aussie Adventures Pastel Canvas Episodes of Lost (Season 1) E.

ok i need to write a poem for someone but i need a start and some ideas ok i need to write a poem but i need help i need ideas on what i should say like give me lines or something that will help me i usually can take it from there or if you wanna really help give me your own sweet love poem than i will change it around maybe add some stuff thanks in advance start with adjectives that describe the person you're writing for find words that will rhyme with those and then add other sentiments start with a title and make the last sentence be that title fill in the rest with a story about your friend it doesn't have to rhyme but be honest about what makes them your friend lover whatever and tell them what life would be without them go to poetry websites choose love poems friendship poems etc and see where they started pick ones that touch your heart or remind you of your friend and use that as a starting point but don't steal else it won't have the full meaning you can never mess up a poem if it comes from the heart then it says it all have fun and don't sweat the details  D.

what's the difference between acoustic guitar strings and electric guitar strings i need to change the e string st on my electric guitar but i'm worried about what will happen if i put acoustic strings on it do they perform differently will it make my electric sound weird will the pickups not well pick up the vibrations from it if you change just one string you need to keep it the same gage as the others the gage is usually measured by the e string s are the most common gage for electric what will happen if you mix gages is that the string you replace will sound funny compared to the others it will be harder to tune as well as the steps between strings will be out because of the mismatched gages electric and accoutic guitar strings are designed differently and made from different materials typically while you can put accoustic guitar strings on an electric guitar is usually a bad idea accoustic guitar strings are typically a much heavier gage and most electric necks are not designed to take the stress of heavy gage strings for prolonged periods many music shops will sell single strings if you don't know what gage you have on the guitar go with s they are the most common gage for electrics though a good set of strings is often or less today and you can get even less expensive strings i suggest changing all the strings when one breaks usually that means the others are going too in the near future as well strings get tired after so much playing or even just sitting on a guitar they will also corrode if they are not made of anti corrosive materials both of these sap sound quality from your guitar the guitar will hold it's tune less well and will sound tired so you want to change strings on a frequent basis anyway if your playing every day and not gigging or recording every couple months is probably all your going to get out of a set before the sound quality is decreased enough that you want to change them if you rarely play you might get six months out of a set assuming it lives in it's case all the time to lengthen string life wipe your strings down with a clean dry cloth every time you play store your guitar in it's case wipe your hands off before playing some brands of string last longer than others the extra buck for a better quality brand over the course of a year can mean one less set of strings you need to buy that year the biggest factor in choosing what strings is playing style electrics come in flat wound and round wound jazz players generally like the flat wounds and not many other genres the gage depends on what you like to do and what style stevie ray vaugn was know to use some outragiously heavy gage strings for example me i personally favor myself s are good as are s but s give me a good middle ground heavier crunch but still easier to bend the heavier the gage the deeper it will sound generally what genre you play also means a good bit ernie ball strings are great for bluesy players fenders tend to be favored by cw musicians i personally like d'addario the combination of sound price and durablility work very well for me ernie ball strings are too rubbery for me especially in drop tunings fender's too brittle and flat sounding for my tastes gibson strings are decent on the accoustic i love the sound and feel of elixirs but had a serious breakage problem with them and couldn't keep them on my guitar even broke on i put on hours before a gig in the nd song of the gig that was the last elixir set i ever bought for the guitar did use some elixir bass strings and found them to be excellent strings so i suggest trying out different strings find ones that fit well with your playing style and your gear some strings respond differently to different pickups on a gibson they might be bright clear and sharp but on a fender they might not sound anywhere near as good on the web you can also find bulk packages of strings which reduces the cost per pack noticably  Clarinet Fender Telecaster Mandolin Gramophone record Floyd Rose Equine conformation Jimi Hendrix Blood on the Tracks Joy Division (band) Harp Pet Sounds Timpani Mattress Whose Line Is It Anyway?

why are calendars why do some calendars start the week on the monday and others on the sunday thank you i don't know why the first couple of answers were so strange i think you have a good question there personally i would say that it is probably the difference between when your work week starts and the religious aspect of the sunday i'm purely guessing here but maybe the monday work week schedule was brought in later so that it is easier to see your work plans on a calendar before that maybe they used the sunday as the start of the week to symbolise going to church and the new week ahead  Gregorian calendar Liturgical year Calendar Sunday Eastern Orthodox Church Fasting Hebrew calendar Easter Week Doomsday rule Holy Week Monday Night Football Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Holiday National Football League Computus Dominical letter ISO 8601 MTV2 Gospel Leap year Calculating the day of the week Major League Baseball television contracts International Fixed Calendar Japanese calendar Daylight saving time Ordinary Time Astrology Pyramid (game show) Rosh Hashanah Irish calendar Days of the week STS-59 Saint Patrick's Day French Republican Calendar Palm Sunday International Date Line Monday Ken Jennings Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Creationism Discordianism Julian day Coptic calendar Channel 4 First Council of Nicaea Pentecost Social rule Jewish holiday Paschal cycle WNNX (FM) Roman calendar Bowl Championship Series Frankie Laine Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
