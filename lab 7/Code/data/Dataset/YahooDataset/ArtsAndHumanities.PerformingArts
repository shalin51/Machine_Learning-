where can i find cello music for grade five i mean good cello music not naff ones i get bored on the cello sometimes understatement and i know if i get fun pieces to play i will enjoy it more because thats what i did with the piano and it was fun thankyou i know what you mean i am bored on my cello right now too there's only so much fun you can have plowing through exercises and trying to figure out a bach cello suite on your own more like frustrating for me it will definitely help to find some new fun pieces i'm not sure if you mean you're in fifth grade or a grade five like a book five playing ability if you're at a book five playing ability a really fun piece is called danse rustique by w h squire it's energetic very fun another good one that i like is tarantella also by squire it might be a bit of a stretch there's a little scale in treble clef but actually like most music it is so much easier than it appears i would be willing to be that anything by squire is fun golterman's concerto no fun it looks a little scary because of the eighth rests but it's not it kind of bounces along it reminds me of a classical ice cream truck song also go to your local music store and see what they have to offer you might see something that sparks your interest there are usually arrangements of pop songs and movie music like star wars and lord of the rings if you like that kind of thing they usually come with a cd of orchestra accompaniment to play along with it which makes it even more interesting really the possibilities are endess it just depends on what you like to play although i have found that it's easier to find fun music for violin than it is for cello hope this helps have fun  Cello Double bass Yo-Yo Ma Viola Violin Sonata (music) Concerto Witold Lutos__awski Igor Stravinsky Philip Glass Max Reger Timpani Johann Sebastian Bach Violin concerto Authentic performance Fugue Claude Debussy Heitor Villa-Lobos Niccol__ Paganini Clef Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Soloist(s) Performance (with orchestra) Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Soloist Performance (without orchestra) Brandenburg concertos Musical notation Steve Reich Maurice Ravel Trombone Sonata form Ralph Vaughan Williams Olivier Messiaen Anton Webern Dmitri Shostakovich Sinfonia concertante George Gershwin Piano trio George Crumb Violoncello concerto Sofia Gubaidulina Grammy Awards of 1998 Kurt Weill Schubert compositions D number 505-998 Suzuki method Pachelbel's Canon Figured bass B__la Bart__k Grammy Awards of 1995 Musical works of Mozart Bassoon Electric Light Orchestra Ren__ Leibowitz Mikis Theodorakis Symphony Mario Davidovsky Elliott Carter Grammy Awards of 1990 Elodie Lauten Zolt__n Kod__ly Lou Harrison Arvo P__rt Mauro Giuliani George Enescu Ladislav Kupkovi__ Benjamin Britten Johannes Brahms Transposing instrument Orchestra Klezmer Joseph Haydn Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Progressive rock Schubert compositions D number 1-504 Piano concerto Grammy Award for Best Chamber Music Performance Krzysztof Penderecki Baroque music Program music Charles Wuorinen The Beach Boys P.

how can you spontaniously make guitar solos louis armstrong used to say that at least six hours of practice went into every spontaneous solo he ever played knowledge of major minor modal pentatonic chromatic and exotic scales helps quite a bit especially that lovely hungarian scale but the secret to a great solo is to find the alternate melody within the same chord structure some people can do this off the top of their heads but most of us have to work on it the process is simple but time consuming learn the song learn everything you can about it every nuance and every alternate melody line remove the chord progression from the melody i use a sideman band in a box or a similar program play the chord progression over and over while you play over it incorporate bits of the melody alternate melody bass line and even quotes from other songs within what you are doing notice that i did not say cram every note that you can into every measure until your fingers bleed make an alternate melody with spaces pacing a buildup a climax and a release just like any good movie just like any great joke memorize the best bits and string them together into a comprehensive solo write it down in a notebook if you can keep track of all the great bits repeat the process eventually you will learn that most chord progressions are very similar and that there are many one size fits all phrases that can be used in soloing you can't just use them all the time but interspaced between bits of genius they can get you through the night nicely you can also listen to the great soloists and borrow little bits from what they do this is called quoting and the more you do it the better you get if you tell people who you borrow from they will inevitably start comparing you to that musician it never hurts to get your name mentioned in the same breath as someone famous this is called borrowing someone's authority and it is legitimate and cool remember a plagiarist is a person who steals from one artist a genius is a person who steals from everybody mostly you play you set up a side man and play on your own you go through the solo part over and over again with your band until you get a sound that everyone agrees is complete genius and you keep track of everything that went right in a performance so you can do it again many lead guitarists record every performance they possibly can it isn't because they're vain it's because something might go right and they want to make sure they can do it again hope this helps  Musical mode Harmonica Chord (music) Tonality Modal jazz Blues Guitar Bitches Brew Louis Armstrong Trance music The Velvet Underground Heavy metal music Blood on the Tracks Bluegrass music Guitar solo Native American music Bringing It All Back Home A Hard Day's Night (song) Music Music genre Violin Clarinet Pop punk Bass guitar Marching band Goldberg Variations Video game music Miles Davis The Beach Boys Folk music Yes Steely Dan Figured bass Umphrey's McGee Bee Gees Bon Jovi Timpani Charlie Parker Trey Anastasio Queen (band) Bebop The Beatles Sampling (music) Roxette Tablature The Who Please Please Me The Church Klezmer Hey Jude The Jam Jewish music Classical music era Metal music Genesis (band) She Loves You Nine Inch Nails ABBA Harp Romantic music Gothic rock Oasis (band) Rock (music) The Emancipation of Mimi RISC A Day in the Life Yesterday (song) Pet Sounds Sonata (music) Led Zeppelin Music of Ireland Nirvana (band) Tone cluster Paul McCartney Love and Theft CPU cache Hurdy gurdy Britpop Blink-182 Carnatic music Black Sabbath Bagpipes Time Out of Mind Serialism Elton John David Bowie Music theory Bob Dylan

i'm so confused wrether i should be a singer dancer but mostly singer ex j lo chris brown usher micheal jackson or a dancer just plain dancer i've been on my grind since i was and i'm now but my parents dont' support me or bearly let get sing in gigs and things so i have to pick my fights well but i do proform thought and for dancing i can dance but i'm a way better singer than i am dancer because i've been singing since i was and i mean i can really acutally sing but dancing i've been doing since but never really took it seriously till now and i know that if i keep on drilling i can become great so it's sorta now or never and things like canadian idol or americain idol won't work because i'll have to become an americain citizen and canadain idol well you have to have parent supervison and my mom has to go to school and she won't sacrifice for me i really gotta and want to make it at least by i'm so confused i don't know what to do please help first even though it seems like it believe me you have a bit more time to get it all together before your carriage turns to pumpkin however your concerns are good ones to have dude i sounded like you at your age my thing was being a famous writer and outdoing my hero evel knievel of all things two very un forgiving dreams all in all my parents were cool with it but not supportive as far as money or education went not to get into my own story but there's a point for you every dollar i made at your age and after getting out of high school went for my dreams i hid it in coffee cans and stuff and managed to save ok i bought borrowed and begged all the things i needed to make a journey happen you know those corny movies like rocky your story in life is the same thing one dude all odds against his plans right you need to trust your inner thoughts become your own best friend on earth keep all your practices up and believe me one day not for ever but one day you wake up and you know you have arrived when they say that god loves a working man in my experience that is a fact for you little surprises will arise based on your own invisible efforts i swear from age until currently every hard day i spent in thankless effort was always met with thousands of cool opportunities that ultimately lead to my surreal life i've had so far i've seen half the world i probably made a million dollars i'm a published writer and i've broken world records and experienced some degrees of fame unfortunately my stunt end of the dreams cost me broken bones and last year a broken neck but that lead to my current business making films and i love it now if you can stay away from breaking legs you will enjoy your trip even more than i did to stop the pannacky feelings you have you need to be your own sensible word in your path to your dreams which means you need to establish your own plans of how you can work in between getting your craft down and how you can build up just enough power to make your own choices in art if you cut two lawns and hide that cash away you will be doubly rewarded in good luck toward your dreams i know what i'm talking about bro it works now make us all proud and i look forward to seeing you knocking us all dead in the entertainment world your frusterated because you have what it takes get it  God Emperor of Dune Miss Saigon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jon Secada Evel Knievel Eric Cartman The Amazing Race The Amber Spyglass Jennifer Lopez A Course In Miracles The Emancipation of Mimi Garth Brooks The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Tina Turner Emotions (album) Billboard Hot 100 Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) C__line Dion The Adventures of Pete & Pete Another Side of Bob Dylan Janet Jackson Faye Wong Bringing It All Back Home Spice Girls Journey (band) Knots Landing About a Boy Slow Train Coming Year of the Spider Luther Vandross Philosophical skepticism The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan W.

can any one teach me to play guitar i barely got a sqier strat and lil amp but i need help to learn how to pay i would recommend that you get together with someone who knows what they are doing knows how to teach plays or can play in the style in which you want to learn guitar students at community colleges are often a good resource you get the benefit of their professors without nearly as much financial investment your local music store should have a guitar teacher and if they don't they probably have a bulletin board that advertises one or many you can always learn a few basic chords and a few riffs from your friends as well sometimes they have a little more patience than the average teacher as well which can be a distinct advantage they can also teach you some bad habits which will be hard to unlearn later so be careful i'll put a few links from similar questions i have answered which might help you get started as well hope they help you if you don't find what you need give me a shout and we'll try to figure it out for you  Martial art Alexander Technique Education Education in the People's Republic of China Kasparov versus The World Education in Romania Education in the United States Brian Jones (musician) Professor Teacher Socrates Education in Japan Bass guitar Password Buddy Guy Current teachings of Prem Rawat Sampling (music) Tai Chi Chuan Aikido Koan Student loan College Nu metal Chinese martial arts Education in Germany Avenue Q Community college Music lesson Ra (board game) Power chord Umphrey's McGee American and British English differences Randy Rhoads Guitar Warren Buffett Unemployment Extreme Programming African American Vernacular English Pantera Chinese University of Hong Kong Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 English as an additional language Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Charter school Waylon Jennings PLATO Critical thinking Theory of conduct Eric Clapton Chord (music) Riff Great Teacher Onizuka Metal music Liam Gallagher SAT Rabbi Mandolin Queen (band) Past teachings of Prem Rawat A Course In Miracles Electric guitar Social rule The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy GED The Sims 2: University Violin Classical education Poker jargon Eddie Van Halen Nurse Glen Ridge, New Jersey Tuition Jimi Hendrix Funk Ludwig Wittgenstein Graduate school Education in India American Sign Language Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Academia Health insurance Red Hot Chili Peppers Distance education Sydney Riot of 1879 Grunge music Education in Hong Kong Brian May Robert Hutchins Management information system Economics Blues Quizbowl Enneagram JET Programme University of Bristol Yin Shun Gross domestic product Tag Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Guns N' Roses

what instrument should i play im goin to highschool and i want to take band im thinkin trumpet saxophone not flute dont suggust it but yea i wanna play something like a trumper or a saxophone trumbone you know those type of instruments out of all of them that you can think of which one do you think would be easiest not to sound lazy i just dont want to end up hating it and quitting i really wanted to do saxophone but what do you all think learning to just make a beautiful sound on any brass instrument takes literally years of hard work while saxophone is not necessarily easier to play you can achieve a rich full sound much more quickly with sax you will get to a point where you can make music and make it sound beautiful faster than you can on trumpet that being said i personally think that the sound of brass instruments is far more beautiful and moving than that of woodwinds sax clarinet etc  Saxophone Big band Clarinet Adolphe Sax Harmonic series (music) Woodwind instrument Brass instrument Embouchure Musical ensemble Brass band Musical instrument classification Concert band Mouthpiece John Coltrane Flute Trumpet Louis Andriessen Tenor saxophone Bassoon The Waterboys Rahsaan Roland Kirk Jazz Bass clarinet C.G.

would you rather act or sing and why i would sing singing expresses so much of who you truly are acting you pretend to be someone you're not with music you can express the way your feeling with a series of oh's by hitting different notes or you can write words singing is so much better than acting because it's a way of expression and a way to get your feelings out there are also so many different styles of singing and each style is the person's style and no one can copy it or make it better it's a way to just be yourself without worrying about people judging you you can just sing what you feel and that's that no one can change it because it's who you are  I Want to Hold Your Hand Whose Line Is It Anyway?

i'm a new piano's learner how i can play piano easier and be a become a good and fast learner plese give me some tips i really love to learn piano make sure you have some basic things down every day so that they quickly become habit sit high enough at the bench that your upper arms are level and that you can stay relaxed at all times don't droop your wrists as this leads to carpal tunnel syndrome when you practise enough warm up with chromatic major and minor scales and when you get to be more advanced play triads and inversions as well the triads you should know for each key are major minor diminished and augmented later you can do seventh chords and diminished chords you can look online to find out how to form each of these chords train your ear by trying to play songs you can sing from memory on the piano first determine what key the song is in by finding which note the song seems to resolve on this note is known as the tonic from there you can simply guess the melody notes by singing each interval aloud or in your head and locating it on the keyboard this ear training helps tremendously when your mind goes blank during a performance even if you forget where to place your hand you can still remember what you're supposed to play next a good way to start learning is to play some of the works written specifically for beginers many famous composers have written something like 'children's pieces' or an 'album for the young' try schumann's 'album fur die jugend' start learning each piece by making sure you understand the rhythms before you start to play start by learning the easier pieces such as humming song and mignon and only move up to harder pieces after mastering those some of the chopin preludes numbers would also be good to start with  Tonality Chord (music) Sonata (music) Musical mode Interval (music) Harmonica Classical music era Chord symbol Minor scale Inversion (music) Seventh chord Fr__d__ric Chopin Romantic music Modulation (music) Figured bass Key (music) Accordion Diatonic functionality Just intonation Songwriter A Hard Day's Night (song) Fugue Blues Jazz Major scale Sonata form Piano Sonata No. 31 (Beethoven) Twelve-tone technique Gy__rgy Ligeti Music Chromatic scale Baroque music Violin Ear training Robert Schumann Dog training Herbie Hancock Goldberg Variations Double bass Modal jazz Consonance and dissonance Concerto Timpani Counterpoint Tone cluster Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Serialism Diving Video game music Witold Lutos__awski Clarinet Olivier Messiaen Chord progression Camille Saint-Sa__ns Musical notation Queen (band) Ferruccio Busoni Gustav Mahler Time Out of Mind Johann Sebastian Bach Symphony Sergei Rachmaninoff A Day in the Life History of sonata form Piano Bebop Pentatonic scale Harp She Loves You Repetitive strain injury The Doors Charles Ives Symmetry Meantone temperament I Want to Hold Your Hand Tristan chord The Beatles March (music) Aerial (dance move) Electronic organ Joseph Haydn Carnatic music Franz Schubert Native American music Well-Tempered Clavier Please Please Me Tablature Claude Debussy Musical analysis Vladimir Horowitz

how long does it take to get used to a sousaphone it usually takes about two weeks to get the shoulder toughened up although the balance point should be pretty clear to you after a few days this also depends on whether you are marching with a brass or fiberglass horn i have a brass one myself always preferred them you can get a shoulder pad but it will cut back just a bit on the sound the main thing is to maintain the posture it may feel good at first but keeping that form will help keep the lower back from straining in the end of course you should never lock your knees drink plenty of water avoid the caffeine natural diuretic and roll your shoulders before after and eventually during though never while on parade the time you play  Marching band Equine conformation Trumpet Sousaphone Professional wrestling holds Weight training Mattress Human position March (music) Embouchure Brass instrument Hyperthermia Aerial (dance move) Breastfeeding Professional wrestling throws Backstroke Brass band Parade (military) Social rule Aikido Harp Contredanse Knife Fecal incontinence Mixed martial arts Clarinet Double bass Urinary incontinence American football strategy Hey Jude Sampling (music) Repetitive strain injury Chair Textile manufacturing Big band Drum and bugle corps (modern) Fiberglass Drill bit Oasis (band) The Doors Radio controlled airplane Glossary of ballet terms Casualty lifting Diuretic Caffeine Horn (instrument) Sailing Rugby union Alexander Technique Internal ballistics Butterfly stroke Hypertension Professional wrestling attacks Tai Chi Chuan Dinghy Password Diving Tuba Water polo Trombone Wind turbine Wing Chun Japanese tea ceremony Boxing Pinball Pok__mon Abilities Swingout Canoe USS Augusta (CA-31) Swimming Japanese toilet Bagpipes Naval mine The Ashlee Simpson Show Kodocha Glossary of climbing terms Golf Authentic performance Archery Timpani Blonde on Blonde Natural Selection (computer game) Breaststroke Shawn Michaels Hogtie bondage Cello Handstand Hangover Theory of conduct Microeconomics 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand 2000 Australian Grand Prix Skateboarding trick Neckbreaker Pole vault Powerbomb Glass Wood

i have a problem when i play the piano no matter what i play especially scales my pinky finger curls up it puts a lot of stress on both of my hands the only thing that somewhat makes this stop are some of hanon's excercises but only after i play them for a long time i know that the th and th fingers share some of the same muscle groups too anybody have any ideas on how to overcome this problem the pinky curling is actually the result of tension not the cause this is a very common problem for students who are starting to play with greater velocity speed x power practicing scales slowly is a great habit and hanon exercises are also a great tool for building velocity and are the ones i like for developing fingers my guess is that the problem is more pronounced in the left hand try playing the exercises and scales with left hand alone when you feel the least bit of tension move your wrist down or up very slightly and then move it back again tension usually builds from the wrists being locked and subsequently transfers to the fingers don't practice with overly curved fingers or high wrists that is an antiquated technique that has caused more injury for players than it was ever worth as you sit at the piano let your arms and hands dangle relaxed and loose at your sides look at the shape and position of your hands it is completely relaxed and the perfect position for playing the piano just bend your elbows and keep that same relaxed position with your hands at the keys stay focused on letting the wrists move slightly through the musical phrase if the wrists are able to move the tension will release don't curl the fingers too much only slight relaxed curve bad bad bad keep the wrists level relaxed and supple  Equine conformation Aikido Professional wrestling holds Harp Double bass Tai Chi Chuan Gesture Carpal tunnel syndrome Horizontal bar Violin Aerial (dance move) Hand Volleyball Repetitive strain injury Backstroke Professional wrestling throws Swingout Internal ballistics Diving Stuttering Urinary incontinence Wing Chun Native American music Fast bowling Archery Suplex Piano Menstrual cup Saxophone Swimming Music lesson Weight training Strike (attack) Tenshinhan Sling (weapon) Table tennis Punch (strike) Clarinet Milton H.

how do you create vibrato when playing the clarinet i play the clarinet and i was wondering how do you do it indeed most clarinetists do not use vibrato in the same way a singer or a flutist does and many do not use vibrato at all some classical clarinetists jack brymer david shifrin will use vibrato to highlight a specific note or section of music as an expression like a dynamic level different styles of clarinet playing however require different tone colors and different levels of vibrato much jazz and ethnic world music require a much less refined tone quality than that used in classical playing for what i do which is balkan folk music the vibrato is used as a part of the tone color i use my abdominal muscles to pulse the sound throughout the tunes and occasionally color the sound further with a jaw vibrato to use the abs just think ha ha ha ha to begin with and eventually smooth out the initial h sounds to use the jaw just think aw aw aw with lip jaw motion and eventually with practice you can smooth that out too either way requires considerable air support and control as well as embouchure development and ab muscle control  Vibrato Clarinet Embouchure Violin Western concert flute Authentic performance Trumpet Bassoon Music genre Viola Flute Oboe Synthesizer Bass clarinet Timpani Harmonica Timbre Music of Albania Recorder Piano Serialism Electric guitar Harmonic series (music) Clarinetist Music Harp Trombone Farfisa Mouthpiece Musical Instrument Digital Interface Orchestra Jazz Multiphonic Marching band Double bass Puberty Classical music era Guitar Musical terminology Tin whistle Shakuhachi Tonality Jack Brymer Tone cluster Klezmer Drawing European classical music Dixieland History of music Igor Stravinsky Eddie Van Halen Guqin Choir Interval (music) Music of Brittany Electronic organ Effects unit Music of Egypt Uilleann pipes Music history of the United States during the colonial era Music of the United States American popular music Bass guitar 20th century classical music Steve Reich Henry Cowell Video game music Electronic musical instrument Miles Davis Music history of the United States Funk Aspect of music Music of Nigeria Consonance and dissonance Sonata (music) Baroque music Louis Armstrong Surf music Tone (linguistics) Chess opening Conducting Music of Ireland Harpsichord Acoustic guitar Chinese language March (music) Salsa music Concert band Swing (genre) Folk music Mario Davidovsky Harmonium Ornette Coleman Original Dixieland Jass Band Renaissance music

acoustic guitars steel string vs nylon string i am looking to buy my first guitar and i'm pretty sure i want it to be an acoustic however i'm not sure if it would be best o buy a steel string what are the advantages and disadvantages of steel strings as opposed to nylon strings that depends a lot on what type of music you want to play most of the acoustic guitar music you hear on the radio is steel string that's the bright sustaining tone most musicians associate with acoustic guitar nylon strings give a more muted mellower tone typically this is used for classical playing although it has been used in popular music very successfully think of clapton's tears in heaven the second lead guitar is a nylon string many people will tell you that a nylon string guitar will be easier to learn on this is true but if you go with a classical guitar with the wider neck and shorter fretboard you might find some troubles transitioning to the standard longer narrower acoustic fretboard  Electric guitar Guitar Bass guitar Acoustic guitar Double bass Slide guitar Harp Classical guitar Piano Twelve string guitar Fender Telecaster Lap steel guitar Clarinet Mandolin Synthesizer Buddy Guy Fret Banjo Guitar/synthesizer Lute Steel guitar Pedal steel guitar Layla John Myung Hurdy gurdy Jimi Hendrix Stevie Ray Vaughan Sitar Blood on the Tracks Charango Old-time music Guqin Saxophone Van Halen Cello Musical ensemble Trombone Fender Bluegrass music Vibrato Heavy metal music Viola Authentic performance Time Out of Mind Andr__s Segovia Guitar pick Drone (music) Eric Clapton Fender Stratocaster Timbre Disco Shotgun Stereoscopy Fingerboard Blues Scheme programming language Phil Collins Led Zeppelin Rickenbacker Resonance Popular music Donovan Video game music Dixieland Stanley Jordan Miles Davis String instrument Berimbau Timeline of trends in music (1950-1959) Yngwie J.

i am and want to learn how to play the violin whats the best brand and size to start with the best thing to do is go to your closest music store and find any chinese model you will always get a good quality for their prices there are tons out there you'll just have to ask yourself how much money you'd like to spend you can even go on line and look at the colors etc if you are planning on actually playing and getting better i'd go with an instrument worth and up if that's too much money for you go cheaper but don't forget to upgrade after a while because a bad instrument will keep down your learning and performance level since you're i will assume that you're an average adult size person so you'll definitely want to go with a full size violin unlike other string instruments violins come in and full sizes not inches the chinese models usually come in complete sets with a case and a bow and sometimes even some extra strings beyond that you might also want to consider purchasing a shoulder rest without one you won't be able to play well unless you have some odd anatomy and the better the shoulder rest from the beginning the better your position and ability to focus on your left hand when you're getting better the best brand shoulder rest in my opinion is the kun there are many different versions and prices of them out there but just the simple black one will certainly last you a long time good luck  Violin Double bass Viola Bass guitar Cello Mattress Harp Piano Binoculars Baseball Stars Timpani IBM PC compatible Marching band Microeconomics Inflation Electronic organ Supply and demand Keynesian economics Sergei Prokofiev Visual Basic Stage lighting Caulfield Grammar School Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Digital photography Nintendo Hornbostel-Sachs Mandolin Betting (poker) Contredanse CPU cache Stradivarius Hash table Saxophone Bow (music) PlayStation 2 Authentic performance Orchestra Shen Gong Wu Craps European classical music Philip J.

how can i record and produce a song my friend and i have a song that we wrote that we want to record and mix on the computer she would sing and i would play the piano what's the best way to record the piano and vocals aka what kind of microphone and what kind of programs would i need to accomplish this it wouldn't have to be anything fancy just something inexpensive that will produce decent results for mics i would recommend the mxl package you get a good vocal mic and an instrument mic for now instead of going into a computer i would get a tascam dp fx digital recorder for why because a computer interface and software package is going to cost almost as much and the learning curve is enormous with a little self contained tascam unit you can load your finished songs into the computer as a wave file and then burn cds from there it has all the effects you'll need built in and it's easy to use the results are cd quality if you are a real computer guru then there are digital interfaces that are cubase is a good program and some include it but the self contained unit is much easier for most people www musiciansfriend com or www americanmusical com have the best prices on this stuff good luck  Multitrack recording Microphone Synthesizer Musical Instrument Digital Interface Commodore 64 Copy protection Computer Apple Macintosh IBM PC compatible Mac OS X Sound recording Linux Atari 8-bit family Cubase Video game music Computer software Recording studio Karaoke Sound card Mixing console Apple II family Digital Equipment Corporation Embedded system Disc jockey Sampling (music) ITunes Software testing Software engineering Floppy disk Digital Performer The Emancipation of Mimi Integrated circuit USB flash drive ZX Spectrum Warez Blood on the Tracks Sound Blaster System/36 Player piano Emacs 3D computer graphics FL Studio Digital circuit Hearing aid Record producer Vocoder Compact audio cassette Time Out of Mind Central processing unit CPU cache Microsoft Amiga Computer-aided design Kraftwerk Empire Burlesque America Online Knoppix Telephone Boards of Canada CPU design Domain Name System Chicago (band) Windows Vista Oscilloscope Cell (microprocessor) Digital audio workstation Hacker Blonde on Blonde Resident Evil (video game) TeX Digital photography History of operating systems Tracker Highway 61 Revisited Nintendo Entertainment System IPod Commodore International Pet Sounds Songwriter Geographic information system AmigaOS Xbox File system Windows XP Video CD Unreleased Madonna songs Perl Sgt.

sax player years of experience year of slouching can i still make a comeback i played in my school's jazz band and concert band for years and was going to be a music major but had some problems with my college and couldn't get into any schools when i came back home so i took one year off i didn't just during that time i only played maybe times for minutes i'm going through depression and other personal problems and don't feel like playing much not to mention that i've gotten really lazy which is something i have to work on i still love music with all my heart and get restless fingers whenever i hear a jazz song critique players when they play and try to find out what they're doing create solos in my head and get nostalgic whenever i see a jazz band i'm going to be a liberal arts major but can't help but long to play again what keeps me from it is that i don't think i'm good enough for one i am pathetic at sight reading could i make a comeback and play again like i used to yes you can come back i was a flute performance major as an undergrad and music ed as a grad student i didn't play for about a year once before and now again this past year and yikes i have some auditions in a few weeks i'm not worried though it was fine before you'll notice that when you start really playing again you won't have the same endurance range tone and intonation it definitely takes time to work back up to where you were but it's not as difficult as you might think a lot of it is like riding a bike it's muscle memory so ingrained in your brain that you will be amazed how quickly it comes back with patience using your life experiences of the past year and some hard work you may even play better than you ever did in not too terribly long a time as for sight reading it is not something that cannot be practiced you can work on sight reading start by trying to read music written for other instruments at an easier difficulty than you are used to always keep in mind meter key signature accidentals notes note patterns rhythms dynamics and there you go good luck  Clarinet Double bass Time Out of Mind Big band Saxophone Music Authentic performance Harmonica Western concert flute Violin Brian Jones (musician) Music genre Blues Marching band Herbie Hancock Traumatic brain injury Piano Musical notation Bassoon Trumpet March (music) Transposing instrument RuneScape quests Trombone Bitches Brew Charlie Parker Shaggy dog story John Cage Native American music Milton H.

how come i can't sing and play guitar at the same time is there a reason why i can't do those things at once everytime i do i lose rhythm for both the song and the guitar is it because i am a beginner at guitar can this be solved or am i just not meant to do both at the same time the above answerers get close to it though the proper term isn't subconscious it's kinesthetic you really can't make something become subconscious but you can make it become a matter of kinesthetic awareness or in short muscle memory also it's not so much a problem of asking two areas of the brain to work together it's a matter of overtaxing several areas of th ebrain as a bass player singer i have some experience in this area here's the problem music is a global function it uses many areas of the brain in both hemispheres you're working with mathematical patterns rhythm aural sensations pitch emotions etc all at once singing involves language functions as well playing guitar involves many of the same musical processing functions as singing but also involves lots of gross and fine motor functions and different actions in one hand than in the other really it's a pretty complex activity brain wise so you take guitar playing which as you know from the necessary level of concentration just to get from chord to chord as you play and combine it with the additional brain workload of singing and you end up with a matter of difficulty which is pretty understandable so what you have to do is work stuff into muscle memory or in other words practice kinesthetic awareness the way i learned to do it was to go slowly and methodically first i made sure i was very solid on and aware of what i was playing then i figured out how the rhythms of the vocal line fit with what i was playing as i said i did this slowly and methodically working out how things fit together then i gradually brought stuff up to tempo the more you do this the easier it gets though you will probably never get to a point where it comes naturally it's just too complex an activity to feel natural the trick as with so many things in the performing arts is to make it look natural even though it isn't by the way it helps to start with something rhythmically simple just strumming on steady quarter or half notes while singing works well it's still pretty complex since you have to arrange the fingers of one hand into chords strum with the other hand and devote lots of brain power to singing keeping a simple steady rhythm in the guitar just reduces one of the many variables in the equation once you've got this you might then think about playing more complex stuff the answerer who mentioned not being able to play hands together on the piano had it right it's a matter of what pianists and drummers cal separation being able do different things with different parts of the body in a way that seems as though those parts of the body are largely unrelated it's really a matter of doing that with your brain have fun edm  Stuttering Music Alexander Technique Dyslexia Time Out of Mind Bass guitar Jazz Violin Brain Music genre Human Blood on the Tracks Tablature Consciousness Musical notation Cognitive science Native American music Double bass Blues Cerebellum Trance music Music of Ireland Aphasia Neuro-linguistic programming Traumatic brain injury Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Science Mathematics Sonata (music) Big band Tonality Highway 61 Revisited Sampling (music) Human brain Marching band The Velvet Underground Neurofeedback Classical music era Clinical depression Sleep Guitar Rhythm guitar King Crimson Microeconomics Autism Synthesizer Slow Train Coming Artificial neural network Philosophy of perception Computer The Beatles Software engineering Tempo Authentic performance Proprioception The Who Hypnosis Urinary incontinence Jet engine Weight training Serialism Second language acquisition Asperger syndrome A Hard Day's Night (song) Unconscious mind Milton H.

am i too old to be moving into a new and creative industry i am and about to move into the health pathway my dream is to work in theatre act dance sing and be creative however unlike most i am not bothered about fame i have no experience in this field and am not the best singer i am however very outgoing energetic creatively inspired and hate the thought of being unforfilled in a medical career am i too old to go to uni and do performing arts do i need a great voice help me wow we have a really refreshing bunch of idealists here no offence intendeded to them but unfortunately their answers are somewhat naieve i'm going on and i work in the performing arts so i think i have some perspective on this the short answer is that yes you are actually too old but please let me qualify that firstly and most importantly you should bear in mind that onoly an extreme minority of people working in the performing arts are making a career or even a living of it the chances are so slim that anyone who does it for that reason should have his or her head examined so your primary reason for getting into the performing arts should be sheer enjoyment and your own happiness and fulfillment and you're never too old to enjoy yourself and to make yourself feel happy and fulfilled so whatever else you read here please get yourself on stage and have a blast as for going to university for a degree remember that this will take at least four more years of your life in fact with performing arts degree programs it often takes more since people in these programs are often doing a full load of coursework while trying to gain professional experience at the same time so now you're over by the time you're done and you're looking for roles that suit someone of your age but the people who are casting people for those roles expect to be casting people in those roles who have eight or ten years or more i have students who started in musical theater and dance when they were in the single digits of age of experience playing younger roles already and those people are your competition so unless you bring something really special to the table you're going to have a tough row to hoe the advice i often give people going into the performing arts is that if you can avoid it don't do it as a career you invite the problem that your hobby your passion really get tied up in making your living most people experience dislike for their job at some point or another so performers often find themselves disliking something they should love also few activities are so tied up in your own sense of self as performing so there's a danger of finding yourself disliking yourself as they say the highs are incredibly high but the lows are incredibly low too if you can keep performing uninvolved with making a living it removes much of that danger but if you're dead set on it only if you feel performing is the only thing you can see yourself doing then you have to do it but if you can find something else you enjoy or at least something else you can tolerate to do for a living and get involved in some good community theater or something along those lines you're in for a healthier attitude about the whole thing edm  Graduate school Theatre Avenue Q Education in the United States Theory of conduct A Course In Miracles Software engineering Ethics Happiness Drama Infantilism Master's degree Tai Chi Chuan John Cage CPU cache Objectivist philosophy Jon Secada Poker jargon Extreme Programming Shaggy dog story Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Little Britain Kylie Minogue Alexander Technique Prostate cancer The Star Wars Holiday Special Current teachings of Prem Rawat Altruism Social rule Cliff Richard Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Charmed Knots Landing Coercion Goodness and value theory Time Out of Mind About a Boy The nature of God in Western theology Ranma __ characters Education in the People's Republic of China Abortion debate Philosophy of language The Emancipation of Mimi Past teachings of Prem Rawat David Hume Michael J.

whats harder an three row accordian or a bajo sexto i'd say it depends on your personal perspective but imo a row accordion would be harder because i have a more difficult time dealing with different pitches with the bellows going in versus going out and i have a very hard time with guitar i think a bajo sexto would be easier because you can see the strings to pluck and know where your frets are  Acoustic bass guitar Tejano music Bass guitar Norte__o (music) Sitar Violin Tablature Fret Music of Ireland Guitar Lute Twelve string guitar Pedal steel guitar Mandolin Musical notation Fingerboard Los Rieleros del Norte String instrument Music history of the United States Double bass Stanley Jordan Slide guitar Harp Lap steel guitar Organ (music) Harmonica Chapman Stick Fast bowling Dobro Intonation Banjo Complexity classes P and NP Uilleann pipes Classical guitar Hornbostel-Sachs Piano Guqin Concertina Synthesizer Cello Flutina Hurdy gurdy Viol Red Special Guitar/synthesizer Halting problem Drone (music) Floyd Rose Open tuning Fender Telecaster Electric guitar Ghost notes Grade (climbing) Ukulele Textile manufacturing Blood on the Tracks Black Sabbath Authentic performance IP (complexity) Musical instrument classification Blues ALGOL 68 Music of Madagascar Slapping Jaco Pastorius Harpsichord Tapping Plectrum Time Out of Mind Subtractive synthesis Double stop Tambura La Bottine Souriante Password Volleyball Tony Iommi MP3 Appalachian dulcimer Chemnitzer concertina Musical instrument Alexi Laiho Anton Webern Ani DiFranco Flute Cuatro Knuckleball Lyric Suite (Berg) MIDI controller Abortion Music of China Musical terminology Cricket ball Laws of cricket Batting (cricket) The Waterboys Eddie Van Halen Victor Wooten Pipe organ Popular music

tips for readig monologues i realy want to be an actress but i really dont know much about reading a scripts and tips you can tell me first off if you want to be an actress you need to know the difference between a monologue and a script a monologue is one person reading a long speech in character a script normally has more then one person in it with the actors and actresses interacting in character now here are some tips i've learned in my drama class read through the script a few times pay special attention to your character's lines try and imagin how the character would be reacting to what is going on around him or her also be on the look out for lines that can be interpretted in a few ways i once read a script that had two possible interpretations it was made to be that way one way was that one of the characters leaves the other the second interpretation is one of the characters kills the other figure that out before you move on now start reading the lines out loud the first time don't worry about being in character just read through it after the second or third time start reading through it with character use the interpretations you've already found to understand how you want to say your lines lose the script and start practicing without it you need to memorize your script before you can worry about the acting part of it once your sure you have it down and you understand how to say the lines you can work on your stage business now work on your stage business figure out how your character moves throughout the scene would your character be sitting down standing up or leaning against something work on your facial expressions and don't forget that if you are working with other people you need to work on ways to have your characters interact if you can do all of that you'll do fine  Asperger syndrome Drama Python programming language Autism Taxi Driver Writing system Humphrey Bogart Hangul Transactional analysis The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson Quentin Tarantino Theatre Kodocha Chinese character Whose Line Is It Anyway?

what are some good acoustic acoustic electric guitar brands for a beginner it really depends on how much you want to spend on a guitar i would suggest getting a decent playable guitar if you get one based on looks or low price and not on playability feel and quality it may be physically hard to play and that would discourage your learning please try the guitars out at your local guitar store music shop if you have a friend that plays the type of instrument that you want to play ask him or her for advice off the top of my head a couple of brands with come with semi reasonable prices but they also make higher priced models that come to mind are epiphone and yamaha but there are many others look on this link for different brands selection and prices http www musiciansfriend com if you've picked out a guitar compare what the local store and the internet is offering price wise i would suggest that if the prices are similar or even if the store brand is just a little higher you may want to go with the store brand since you can reach out and touch someone if you need work adjustment done to your instrument or have any questions in general however if you feel comfortable buying directly off of the internet and the store price difference is too high go for it note that a lot of music stores not all can give you a better deal than what is on the current price tag in the store you might want to ask about a discount if the price is really higher than what is shown for the same instrument on line good luck  Bass guitar Mattress Inflation Tesco Violin Synthesizer Mutual fund Double bass Electronic organ Piano Acoustic guitar Harmonica Digital photography MP3 Supply and demand Flute Musical Instrument Digital Interface Player piano Bluegrass music Nuclear power Aldi Price discrimination Transformer Audiophile String instrument Binoculars Oscilloscope Wal-Mart ELO rating system Atari ST Clarinet Department store Instrument amplifier Monetary policy Strap-on dildo Bond Dobro Video game music Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Laserdisc Floppy disk Electronic commerce Retailer Transposing instrument Blood on the Tracks Fender Capacitor Tablature Mandolin Sears Holdings Corporation ITunes Music Store Management information system Guitar/synthesizer Hyperinflation Illegal drug trade Saxophone Jerry Garcia Nintendo Bulk vending $ale of the Century C.F.

buying a cello i am going to start to learn the cello and i would like to now what price they run at and what brand i should get and anything else i need to know cellos can be found that cost anywhere between and millon you'll almost certainly not find anything of any quality under though and if you can afford it you'd probably want something even better than that but price alone is not a good indicator of quality you need to try a bunch and find one that feels good to you however as an absolute beginner you're not going to have a feel for what you like and don't like in an instrument therefore you must find a reputable teacher right away and meet with him her to discuss what to look for in an instrument where to look in your area etc he she can also help you figure out what a good amount to spend on a first instrument based on how serious you are about learning oh and every instrument is different so brand often means very little in terms of cello only fairly low end instruments will have brand names as they are made in factories higher quality ones are identified by luthier the person who made the instrument  Cello Violin Gross domestic product Goodness and value theory Trademark Harp Bond Sonata (music) Inflation Commodity Stradivarius FairTax Amateur astronomy Labor theory of value Clarinet Paintball Supply and demand ATI Technologies Yo-Yo Ma Tesco Microeconomics Monetary policy No Child Left Behind Act Double bass Authentic performance Education in the People's Republic of China Cigar Mutual fund Value Price discrimination Real estate bubble String instrument Predatory lending PRS Guitars Luthier Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Brand Binoculars Summa Theologiae Bow (music) Sergei Prokofiev Offshoring Fender Mario Davidovsky Ford Motor Company Information Services Procurement Library PLATO Just In Time Education in the United States Viola Illegal drug trade CPU design Biodiesel AvtoVAZ Arbitrage Antonio Stradivari Capitalism Aikido Deflation (economics) Tax Musical works of Mozart Mattress Technical analysis Shit Progressive tax Airline Hyperinflation RuneScape economy Externality Timpani Publicly funded medicine Aldi Mortgage Interest Stars!

ok i got a big guitar problem i broke my vibrato arm off in the bridge and i don't know how to get it out anyone know how to fix this other than replace the bridge whew that's rough man you have a few options though i'm going to assume we're talking about a strat style vibrato where the arm threads into a hole in a metal block under the bridge or at least something similar to that the easy way to explain what to do would be to send you to a hardware store and tell them you need to extract a screw they should be able to explain it to you but i'll go with it first off is any of the arm still protruding from the hole if so you can cut a slot in the top of it and use a flathead screwdriver to remove it you can use a hacksaw or metal file to cut the slot but a dremel tool with a cutoff wheel works best even if the arm is broken off flush with the bridge you might leave a mark on the surface of the bridge but you'll get the broken piece out if the arm is broken anywhere below the level of the surface of the bridge you'll need a screw extractor these are available at any hardware store you'll need a power drill using the bit that comes with the extractor drill a hole right down the middle of the broken arm as close to the center as possible the extractor itself will look something like a screw but with threads that go the wrong way and which are in much less tight of a spiral than the threads of a screw you put the extractor into the hole and turn it counterclockwise as if to loosen it since the threads on the extractor go the opposite way of the threads on a screw they tighten into the hole as you loosen the screw and the broken piece of the arm will come out as a last resort you can get a drill bit about the diameter of the arm itself and drill the whole thing out but then you'll have to find some way to re tap the hole to accept a standard arm and that will be tough you'd be better off just taking the thing apart and getting a new block for it you can get just the block without replacing the whole bridge but these things shouldn't be screwed in too tight so a screw extractor should do the trick if you're not confident with power tools around your guitar though take it to a shop good luck edm  Metalworking Woodworking Wrench Tire Violin Floyd Rose Lathe Floppy disk Vise (tool) Textile manufacturing Internal ballistics Knife Guitar Drill Drilling and threading Screw thread Reamer Casting Gramophone record Screwdriver Poker jargon Chuck (engineering) Glossary of firefighting equipment Tap wrench Glossary of climbing terms Upholstery Hydraulic machinery Professional wrestling throws Harmonica Chess strategy and tactics Table saw Clinker (boat building) Seismic retrofit CPU cache Zippo Piccolo Junior Saga Bong Clockwise and counterclockwise Machine tapers Kitchen Machine tool Anchor Timpani Aluminium Glossary of American football Steyr Mannlicher M1901 Professional wrestling holds Oscilloscope Compiler optimization Diving Textile manufacturing terminology STS-114 Electric guitar Glossary of partner dance terms Drill bit sizes Printed circuit board Diamond Redundant array of independent disks Incandescent light bulb Western concert flute Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Bolted joint Cartridge (firearms) Rifle IPod Windows XP Brewery Equine conformation Nine Inch Nails Wood carving Terminal ballistics Figure skating Cello Amateur telescope making Saw Aerial (dance move) Atari 8-bit family Wire Disc brake Lathe (metal) Sail-plan Fender Stratocaster Motor oil Swingout Headlight Spark plug Plane (tool) Dodge Neon Springfield 1903 rifle Ethernet Rigging Lawn mower

if i can play the fife decently will flute come easily how do the instuments differ are the embouchures the same of a little different will one come easily after another is learned does it require more muscle to play the fife vs flute thanks for the people who designated their time for this question whoever has the most detailed and good reponce sincerely gets best answer so besides the fingering i dont have much work to due fingering wont be a problem because i have played several woodwinds for years soprano alto tenor saxophone clarinet recorder etc i have played a flute a long time ago yet didnt develope an embouchure at that time so its hard to tell but the fingering i have down thanks so much for your help my fewllo yahoo answerers p s you all have great answers and it is going to be really hard to choose a best answer one of you gave me good articles about this subject another gave me their personal experience whatever i choose i am sorry if it not your answer well i actually played fife before flute then again i started out on clarinet and had also done sax beforehand so you may be starting out with a little more of a disadvantage where the keys are concerned now the fife i used was metal chrome plated nickel i think and the mouthpiece was a bit of the same metal as the body welded directly onto it i've seen other fifes that have no raised portion on the mouthpiece and none of them have the plateau mouthpiece that concert flutes all use and as others have said the flute has all of those extra keys for the sharps and flats but the basic fingerings are the same those six holes on the fife correspond exactly to the main six finger positions on the flute so first things first if you don't already own a flute get a decent beginner's model if you take a knowledgable flute player along you can probably find an old bundy or artley or similar brand at a pawn shop for under if you bargain well most fifes play best using the old hard embouchere whereas concert flute uses the soft embouchere that louis fleury developed in the early th century if when you play fife your lips are rather firm and the corners of your mouth are drawn slightly out then you're using a hard embouchere get a flute player to teach you the proper lip formation the sooner you learn that the better you will sound and on the flute velocity is nice but they'll love you for your tone learning how to use the sharps and flats keys is not all that difficult a good book of beginner intermediate exercises with a cheap fingering chart is all you'll need i strongly recommend getting a teacher for at least a few lessons maybe four or six spaced every other week just to get the embouchere started right and to correct any pesky problems with finger position you might start out with you can often get lessons cheaply if you go to a local university and ask or advertise at the music school flute majors often are desperate for a few bucks otherwise go to the best band instrument music store in your town  Harmonica Tin whistle Marching band Bassoon Big band Transposing instrument Trombone Oboe Baritone saxophone Harmonic series (music) Fife (musical instrument) Brass instrument Mouthpiece Alto horn Authentic performance Woodwind instrument Chess strategy and tactics Drill bit Piano Tenor saxophone Pet Sounds Bass guitar Double bass Guitar Uilleann pipes Music lesson John Coltrane Gramophone record Harp Lute Concert band Strap-on dildo Vibrato Brass band Multiphonic Bass clarinet Louis Andriessen Musical instrument classification Carnatic music King Crimson The Selmer Company Music of Brittany Horn (instrument) Brian Jones (musician) Music of Ireland A Course In Miracles Social rule Bagpipes George Crumb March (music) Concerto Mario Davidovsky Cornett Timpani Sun Ra Aikido Terminal ballistics C.G.

how do altos find singing defying gravity from wicked just curious if it is out of peoples belting range or not is it easier for a soprano to sing i think it really just depends on experience and range i am very very alto lol sometimes it's frustrating how low my range is but i manage to belt this song just fine some days it sounds better than others but everyone has an off day if you don't get it right the first time keep trying even if it is out of your range you can learn to adapt through practice  Transposing instrument Saxophone Trombone Clarinet Soprano Aikido Stuttering Boy soprano Flute Countertenor Therion (band) Capoeira Singer Castrato Harmonica Western concert flute Choir 10cc Songwriter Carmen Recorder Mass in B Minor (Bach) Authentic performance Musical terminology Sacred Harp Vocal range Tenor The Jazz Singer Basso Hansel und Gretel Alto horn Clara Ward Trumpet Baritone saxophone Coloratura The Beatles Musical instrument classification Faye Wong W.

what is the best way to unstick a trombone tuning slide i recently picked up a used bundy student model trombone it is a simple slide trombone but the tuning slide is stuck i was wondering if there were any effective safe ways to unstick the tuning slide without having to take it in to a shop for repair spencer's idea is valid but get penetrating oil from dad's toolbox or the local hardware store you'll have to clean well when you're done your local repair shop has a tool for this purpose and if that tool works easily they may not even charge you to get it out as it would only take a couple seconds trying to get it out yourself could cause damage to soldered joints or braces and just isn't worth the risk if the letting penetrating oil work overnight idea doesn't work it's shop time if it's seriously stuck in there as would be with corrosion the repair tech will desolder the joints and remove them then he will knock the tubes that are stuck out using a mandrel and a hammer then he will strip the contacting surfaces polish them up and resolder all of those joints back together not your typical quick home repair  Soldering Trombone Guitar Knife Solder Drill bit Seismic retrofit Screw Floppy disk Violin M16 (rifle) Bong Lathe Welding Brazing GLOCK Friction Manual transmission Tire Bass guitar Radio controlled car Johnny 5 Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Woodworking Circuit design Internal ballistics Aerial (dance move) Operation Petticoat Manicure Computer Airsoft Naval mine Motor oil Motorcycle Hard disk Strap-on dildo Hand grenade Oral sex Extreme Programming Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Tesla coil Slide rule Autogyro Disc brake C programming language Earring STS-114 History of computing hardware Oscilloscope Volleyball Glossary of climbing terms Beretta 92F/FS Two-stroke cycle Curling Password Upholstery Second Battle of the Atlantic Heinkel He 112 HMS Ramillies (07) Windows XP Devil sticks Tattoo Electric guitar Big band Mach kernel Corrosion Marching band Firefighter Gasoline USS Vestal (AR-4) Tampon Electroshock gun Printed circuit board Winning Streak Gun safety USS S-38 (SS-143) Protoss Handloading Fossil fuel power plant Professional wrestling attacks Ammunition Guqin Nuclear power Piano Skateboarding trick Carbon dioxide Textile manufacturing Personal weapon Password cracking Table saw Compiler optimization Thermal power station USS Waters (DD-115) Ultraviolet Olduwan Bassoon Pinball

how do you maintain vibrato when singing all three of your questions basically have one answer breath support to warm up your voice is get in touch with your breathing apparatus and make sure that you have turned the motor on good singing always involves good breathing habits trying to sing without warming up is like jump starting your car it gets shocked into running where a car motor can take this abuse the human voice cannot to achieve power or dynamics of any sort means using your body as the motor of your voice the fragile muscles of your larynx are just not that rugged as to take on the whole work load that job belongs to the x bigger muscles of your belly and back a vibrato is a natural function of the vocal cords when the cords are activated by the puffs of air coming up from the lungs they swing side to side to produce a musical tone when the breath flow is steady and constant the cords will also oscillate up and down this movement is heard as vibrato if you try and force it to happen you will only wind up abusing other muscle groups learn to use your breath flow in an efficient manner take singing lessons to achieve power and vibrato best wishes and keep on singing  Violin Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Equine conformation Stuttering Reptile Weight training Drowning Exercise Respiratory system Larynx Traumatic brain injury Muscle Brain Vibrato Authentic performance Urinary incontinence Synthesizer Lung Marching band Diving Cerebellum Aikido Avalanche Ecco the Dolphin Fire fighting Professional wrestling throws Parachuting Jet engine Esophageal speech Scuba set Alexander Technique Western concert flute Spinal cord injury Human voice Shock Tesla coil Breaststroke Fuel injection Musical terminology Transformer Poliomyelitis Motor cortex Electric motor Energy development Musical instrument Peripheral nervous system Whale song Breath Lawn mower Phonation Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Swimming Homeostasis Insulin The Ashlee Simpson Show Automobile Vowel Shaggy dog story Trumpet Mechanical ventilation Action potential Slow Train Coming Butterfly stroke Effects unit Johann Philipp Reis Spinal cord Motorcycle Rebreather Gliding Vocal range Music lesson Toyota Prius First aid Volleyball Asthma E85 Bates Method Music Diesel engine Massage Cognitive science Puberty The Marshall Mathers LP Car handling Aerial (dance move) Circulatory system Socrate Swingout Bungee jumping Eye Breathing gas Capoeira Warm-blooded Aphasia Tetrapod Extreme Programming

i'm a lefty should i play left handed guitar i've jsut started having guitar lessons last week and right now i have a rght handed guitar i'm left handed and i've been wondering if i should play left handed guitar i think the first time how he told me how to hold i had it switched arund but he corrected me so which should i play plus if i'm going to play left handed will it be more expensive i'm a lefty too but i play right handed guitars and basses i would go with what's more comfortable to you but you should consider that at the outset it's easier for folks to teach you in the in the standard right handed position there are more right handed guitars to select from a lot of times left handed guitars may cost a bit more if they are available in the model that you're looking at chord charts and tablature are going to be reversed and there is usually a right handed guitar to use if there are jam sessions that you attend and want to sit in on if you didn't bring your guitar with that being said there are a more than a few famous lefties that play left handed guitars and basses good luck btw it's not any harder to learn the right handed way of playing  Harmonica Blood on the Tracks Guitar Highway 61 Revisited Tablature Electric guitar Blonde on Blonde Brian Jones (musician) Violin Time Out of Mind Double bass I Want to Hold Your Hand The Yardbirds Buddy Guy Queen (band) Oasis (band) Bringing It All Back Home Red Hot Chili Peppers Rock (music) The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Slide guitar Dog training Country music Donovan Lonnie Donegan Twelve string guitar The Velvet Underground A Hard Day's Night (song) Blur Musical notation The Shadows Music genre Joy Division (band) The La's John Frusciante Mouse (computing) The Stone Roses Slow Train Coming Rush (band) Bob Dylan (album) Beyond Shadows DrumMania Mot__rhead Mandolin The Beatles Hey Jude Fender Telecaster Therion (band) Another Side of Bob Dylan The Waterboys The Cure She Loves You Eric Clapton Warren Haynes Alice Cooper New Morning The Church Van Halen Bon Jovi Bolt Thrower (band) Left-handed Trey Anastasio Jazz The Wedding Present James Hetfield Def Leppard 1957 World Series The Kinks Sex Pistols Frankie Goes to Hollywood King Crimson Harp Pearl Jam Black Sabbath Music of Ireland Aerial (dance move) The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars Planet Waves Swingout Eddie Van Halen Love and Theft Iron Maiden Rod Stewart Led Zeppelin Chord (music) Carter USM 2000 Australian Grand Prix Quarashi The Ventures Fleetwood Mac The Who Elton John Guns N' Roses Nirvana (band) GuitarFreaks The Masters Apprentices Bohemian Rhapsody Layla

i want to become a musical director composer apprentice help i just recently gave her a note explaining that i really admire her and everything she does i really want to become her apprentice but i am not sure how to approach this i understand that i may be too young i am still considered a adolescent i hold the highest respect for her i actually fear her maybe that explains how much respect i hold for her if this makes any difference at all this is a christain theater company please tell me thet best thing i should do i see that the first person to repsond just crushed my dreams oh adults the are so incompetent i do have signififcant musical talent but i think i will just give up no use trying if your no good does this person have a degree or more in music you'll eventually need one or more of them also meanwhile perhaps you can assist with small things but unless you have a specific proven skill at a professional level that she can depend on i doubt she would use you in any capacity that would reflect upon her work you said christian theater so i am assuming this is church based non professional there is sometimes more latitude there but if it were an important job they would get and adult professional then an adult amateur so just make yourself available and you already gave her a note showing your interest couldn't hurt unless you get creepy about it  Apprenticeship Autism Second language acquisition Software engineering Pitaten Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Tonality Intelligence quotient Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Economic inequality Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Asperger syndrome Contract Psychology Motion picture rating system Creationism Lawyer Human Scientology beliefs and practices Extreme Programming Human height Theory of conduct Go ranks and ratings Transactional analysis Mediation Professor Mental retardation Librarian Labour economics Paranoia Agent Scientific method Pedophilia Abortion debate Coming of age Lincoln-Douglas Debate Adolescence Avenue Q A Course In Miracles Prophets of the Dark Side Theodicy Psychoanalysis Amateurism Hearing impairment Infantilism Unemployment Boy Scouts of America Age of consent Guild Free trade Entropy Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints The Apprentice 2 Rick Santorum Social psychology Trinity Electrical engineering Juris Doctor Storytelling One Tree Hill (TV series) Paralegal Law of value Child sexual abuse Androgen insensitivity syndrome Labor theory of value Stuttering Predestination Self-concept Ontological argument Sexual orientation Hikikomori Artificial consciousness Paul Morphy Value system Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Baptist Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Sonata (music) Civil rights Supernatural Commodity markets Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Charles Grandison Finney Education in Portugal Working memory Broadway theatre Species Social rule Trade union Singing school A Day in the Life Jacob Pavlovitch Adler Current teachings of Prem Rawat Jon Secada Human capital Merit Leadership Philosophical skepticism Church of Christ High school subcultures Strong atheism

how can i book any artist in my hometown what re the procedures where should i call to book them etc im looking to start booking artist of high caliber but don't know the hows nor the capital needed to start bringing at least one of them on one of the artist's cds there should be a credit line for their professional management do not waste their time unless you have money up front to pay them do not expect to have them play for gate meaning you'll pay them when you count the money from all the tickets you hopefully sell they want their money up front and it it is up to you to promote the event in such a manner that they get paid all your expenses get paid you've never done this before have you no clue about what needs to be done and how much is costs and hopefully a little sumthin' sumthin' left over for you do not touch this unless you are already wealthy enough that you can afford to drop a significant amount of before you hear a note and then it would be nice if you got that money back plus but no guarantee do not expect any financial institution lend you money for this either and if you want to know how much money you have to front like the old saying goes if you need to ask you can't afford it you are responsible for everything insurance security publicity electric janitorial services a bond in the city you perform in ushers food just let your mind wrap itself around this a little bit run forrest run  Bond Insurance Life insurance Mutual fund Gold standard Government debt Corporation Publicly funded medicine Health insurance Economy of Russia Finance Stock Gross domestic product Credit card Citigroup Money Taxation in the United States Mortgage Hyperinflation Annuity Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Money supply Bretton Woods system Tax Privatization Debt Public policy Inflation Social Security debate (United States) Predatory lending Capitalism Microcredit Social Security (United States) BC Rail Graduate school Economy of the United States Canadian and American health care systems compared Monetary policy Contract National Health Service Government National Mortgage Association Ponzi scheme Collateralized debt obligation FairTax Economy of India Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Unemployment Variable universal life insurance Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Craps Central bank Financial analyst Capital accumulation Salary cap Baseball Education in the United States Derivative (finance) Enron Corporation Personal finance Financial markets United Artists Toronto-Dominion Bank Security (finance) Deflation (economics) Arbitrage The Amazing Race Economy of Pakistan Blackjack United Kingdom corporation tax Poker jargon United States Postal Service Commodity markets Investment bank Yield curve Blackburn Rovers F.C.

audition help i play clarinet in a symphony and auditions for seats are coming up for those who do not know what im talking about i mean seats as in a competition for the first seat as in whos the best i have really strict parents and they really want me to get first seat i agree with them i really have no reason not to get first my parents have bought me the best quality instrument but still im so frustrated i noticed that recently ive kinda fallen out of clarinet i dont feel the same feeling when i play anymore i feel like ive lost a part of me i feel so ashamed cause i know i shouldnt feel this way the audition peice is not very hard at first but if u analyze it closely there r some small things that make a big difference and its so hard to llearn everytime i go over it it seems like im not improving no i cant quit now i trie to listen to other clarinet players in hopes that it will inspire me but it just makes me feel pathetic what can i do hard work is never wasted you've posed two questions one is how to win that audition and the other is what to do about feeling uninspired as for the first part play clean and get to the pretty notes charlie parker find some way to put your own stamp on the music and express yourself listen to recordings of the piece so you can get some more ideas and that will set you apart from the rest record yourself periodically and you will hear the improvement as for the second part you should try going to a different teacher or taking a masterclass or even just listening to some really awesome music that inspires you i'm a classical player but nothing inspires me more than listening to some burning jazz i was in the rd year of my music degree when i felt like you feel and i went to a week long flute camp that gave me enough inspiration to continue through to the end of my year degree just because it was a different teacher with a contagious passion for music  Clarinet Sonata (music) Charles Ives Big band Bass clarinet Saxophone Music Authentic performance Vibrato Music genre Philip Glass Charles Mingus 20th century classical music Jazz Timpani Sampling (music) Bassoon Past teachings of Prem Rawat Olivier Messiaen Poker jargon Double bass Violin Steve Reich Blues King Crimson Marching band Sergei Prokofiev Blood on the Tracks Flute Trombone Arnold Schoenberg Black Sabbath European classical music Transposing instrument Concert band Mario Davidovsky Journey (band) Igor Stravinsky Shaggy dog story Time Out of Mind Jethro Tull (band) Chick Corea Video game music Musical works of Mozart Roxette Miles Davis Therion (band) Classical music era Spice Girls Jon Secada Charlie Parker Recorder John Cage Captain Beefheart March (music) Musical ensemble Henry Cow Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Elliott Carter Concerto Nashville Skyline Joseph Haydn Henry Cowell Lil Hardin Armstrong Oboe Louis Andriessen The Selmer Company Harmonic series (music) Microeconomics Social rule Piano trio Bitches Brew Popular music Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Smiths Symphony No. 10 (Mahler) Pet Sounds New York Knicks Highway 61 Revisited Alex Ferguson Johannes Brahms Definition of music Choir I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Heitor Villa-Lobos Joy Division (band) Parsifal W.

wicked the musical does anyone know why the last note in i'm not that girl is so low i have seen wicked times and watched several youtube videos and i think even the best singers stephanie j block kerry ellis etc sound awkward singing that bottom note i am no musical theory expert but is it something to do with the key that it is sung in or the major minor chord just wondering if anyone knows why stephen s decided to write it that way well all of glinda's songs were supposed to be more high pitched to represent her cheerful and hyper personality elphaba is more of a pessimist and i'm not that girl is supposed to be a sad song as well i think the note is so low because it represents how down elphaba is feeling because she doesn't think anyone will ever love her a happy glinda song would be more likely to end on a high note and everything elphaba does sings is supposed to contrast glinda because they're opposites  Wicked (musical) Elphaba The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Glinda Avenue Q Wizard (Oz) The Emancipation of Mimi Wicked (novel) A Hard Day's Night (song) Somewhere Over the Rainbow Tonality Key (music) Musical mode Modulation (music) We Belong Together Fiyero Chord (music) Inversion (music) Son of a Witch Blood on the Tracks The Ashlee Simpson Show Songwriter Power chord Heavy metal music Beatmania IIDX The Wiz Musical terminology Tom Waits Just intonation Musical notation Interval (music) 10cc Sacred Harp Blur Barbershop music Transposing instrument Crazy in Love Tablature Clarinet Nessarose Queen (band) Gregorian chant Hey Jude Timpani R.

how do i get over my stage fright i'm not shy i love to act and dance and play piano and i don't mind being on stage but when i'm asked to sing in front of people i freak out i take voice lessons and i'm not that bad i just can't sing in front of people what do i do before you go out on stage to sing take a full minute to yourself do some deep breathing exercises to relax you clear your mind and let your body relax this also works for public speaking events also during your performance you can keep calm by not letting your eyes rest on any one person if your voice lesson instructor wants you to look around the room while you sing this lets your audience think you're singing to them not at them then never rest too long on any one person if your instructor wants you to pick a spot on the back wall and stare at it yes i've seen people want you to do this then just concentrate on that spot and don't let anything that's going on in the audience shake you also always smile this shows that you have a confidence that you really may not feel  Social rule Shaggy dog story Whose Line Is It Anyway?

does anyone know any amusing soprano baritone duets i have a recital coming up this spring and i'd like to do a duet with my boyfriend who is a baritone i am a soprano does anyone know of any entertaining classical style duets for these voice types other than the zerlina giovanni duet from don giovanni which we've already sang other than la ci darem la mano from don giovanni there's also crudel perch finora from the marriage of figaro there's also figaro and susanna's opening duet from the marriage of figaro though figaro is technically a bass the role is in the range of most baritones of these my favorite may be crudel perch finora susanna is tricking the count into supposedly meeting her int he garden for a tryst which he is all too willing to do it is the countess who will be waiting there for him dressed as susanna and throughout the duet susanna is desperately trying to keep her story straight the opening duet from the marriage of figaro is cute with figaro measuring their new bedroom for a bed but it's not really that amusing unless you do the whole scene consisting of the first duet the following recitative the second duet the next recitative and figaro's first cavatina through these numbers susanna is able to convince figaro that the noble count wants to sleep with her granted this sequence is not very long but it might be a little much for a recital especially given that your boyfriend would have the big solo not you there's also the papageno papagena duet from the magic flute papageno has been wishing throughout the opera for a mate who will suit him near the end his wish is granted and he finds himself with his feathered beloved they stutter a lot it's lots of fun by the way if you do stuff from the marriage of figaro in translation i recommend the w h auden translation in the score published by boozey and hawkes if you can find it the g schirmer edition with the ruth and thomas martin translation is much cheaper and more widely available but auden was by far the superior poet  Don Giovanni Die Zauberfl__te Soprano The Barber of Seville The Creation Baritone Carmen The Queen of Spades Saxophone Mezzo-soprano Opera Tenor Coloratura Rigoletto (opera) Trombone Igor Stravinsky Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Shaggy dog story Madama Butterfly Bassoon La boh__me Rom__o et Juliette Philip Glass Bryn Terfel Hilary Duff Baritone saxophone Die Entf__hrung aus dem Serail Don Pasquale Porgy and Bess Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven) Tosca Turandot W.

big deal how do i get over my terrible stage fright i can sing and act but as soon as im in front of people i freeze and my throat gets all dry and i sound horrible i feel like there is no way out of this someone help it's hard going in front of people for the first couple times i can sing dance and act and there are times when i get really nervous the key is to have confidence in yourself and in your abilities to be able to zone out the audience as if you were the sole person on that stage a lot of it starts from the inside in your mind expose yourself more and more to the public whether it be a couple people or thousands train yourself to be comfortable taking a class or two in technique can boost your confidence and preparation just believe in yourself and find that driving force that lets you enjoy singing and acting once you get past the barriers of self consciousness performance is a breeze it's about trusting yourself and letting your inner walls collapse you can do it  Magic (illusion) Genesis (band) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Wall The Ashlee Simpson Show Time Out of Mind Naruto jutsu Emotions (album) Social rule Luminoth Sant Thakar Singh Tank Current teachings of Prem Rawat Lucid dreaming StarCraft Secret Missions Drama The Contender (television series) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Great Teacher Onizuka Items in the Metroid series Lightsaber combat Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Dance of the Vampires Spidey Super Stories Saved by the Bell Blood on the Tracks Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story Treehouse of Horror V Infantilism Meat Loaf Blonde on Blonde The Kinks Boyz II Men Theatre Computer Sento Equine conformation Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Milton H.

did audience members actually throw tomatoes at bad performers in the past this question might sound ridiculous i know but i wanted to know the answer i always wondered where the hell the audience got tomatoes to throw from i can't imagine people going to a show carrying a big box of tomatoes just to throw at performers whom they think it's bad did audiences actually used to throw things on stage at people who they thought sucked or is this some old joke myth tomatoes cabbages rotten fruit and eggs deadly potatoes anything was fair game they didn't bring bushels in by the way it was all carried in the large pockets of their waistcoats and other discrete hiding places you cannot imagine that the proprietors would approve of such a thing but it was all part of the entertainment spoiled food was relatively easy to find since there was no refrigeration and if you got to throw it at someone then you still got some value out of it i suppose the performer didn't have to be bad either if the performer was doing something that wasn't to the crowd's taste or if the overall mood was bad even a good performer could receive a blessing this was especially true of late shows after the audience had already had some refreshment or shows at the end of the month or just before payday it was your responsibility as a performer to lift that audience out of it's foul mood and woe betide you if you did not play to the audience there were some performers who refused to even set foot on a stage during a full moon but an audience was just as likely to heap praise upon you if you were successful so that superstition eventually died out remnants or this tradition exist today how many country bars and biker bars have chicken wire draped over the stage to deflect beer cans and shot glasses how many comedians end their careers because they cannot overcome the hecklers that inevitably show up at every performance the tradition may have become watered down but it has never died and who knows if the best that the recording industry can offer us are spoiled teenage alcoholics who can't sing or act their way out of a traffic court the whole thing might just be revived again  Tomato Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Lucille Ball Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Magic (illusion) Saturday Night Live Ron and Fez Clown MRE Russian joke Joke Volleyball Theory of conduct Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Cuisine of Denmark Film RuneScape quests Conker's Bad Fur Day McDonald's Spidey Super Stories EastEnders Poker jargon Chili con carne Minstrel show Hey Jude I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Stand-up comedy Whose Line Is It Anyway?

what are some vocal exercises to help with the sound of my speaking voice you need to find the area of your optimal speaking pitch this area is fairly standard for most voices of course we hear unusually high or low pitched voices that are unique at the same time they may be improperly produced with time speaking outside of your optimal speaking pitch range can tire and weaken your voice for younger females late teens early s the pitch may be somewhere between the middle c on the piano and the b or b flat just below the middle c more likely the optimal pitch is about b flat maybe the a just below for women in their s and s optimal pitch usually is around the a or a flat for older women optimal speaking pitch is around a flat g and perhaps a bit lower of course for male voices there is a different optimal pitch range i can explain how you can find it but if you are doing this exercise slightly incorrectly you may not be able to find it most people press a hum when they first try this gently place your hand over the bridge of your nose and your cheekbones if you can take a full comfortable breath and sigh into a hum sliding down through the notes from about d just above middle c one area of the slide will feel buzzier isolate that note speak for a while like a robot on that pitch it should feel very good focus on that easy buzzy feeling then inflect your voice so that you are using the pitches just above and below that note speak naturally  Clarinet Violin Harmonica Saxophone Vocal range Flute Trombone Timpani Bass guitar Tonality Stuttering Piano Goldberg Variations Musical mode Alto horn Equine conformation Tone (linguistics) Blues Social rule Bagpipes Musical terminology Musical Instrument Digital Interface Human voice Pitch (music) A Day in the Life Guitar Sound effect Authentic performance Helium Chinese language Guqin Musical notation Horn (instrument) German language Fast bowling Harpsichord Harp Transposing instrument Tablature Clef Bicycle Stereoscopy Japanese language Tae eul ju Well-Tempered Clavier Physical attractiveness Taiwanese (linguistics) Fugue Hangul Singer Anchor Softball Bassoon Western concert flute Pipe organ Tin whistle Double bass Mouse (computing) Uilleann pipes Harmonic series (music) Weight training New Zealand English Time Out of Mind Mute (music) Screw Non-native pronunciations of English Sign language Chess opening Note Dither Interval (music) Power chord Marching band M16 (rifle) Synthesizer Speech synthesis Blue Man Group Mattress Electric guitar The Empty Child International Phonetic Alphabet Oral sex Sandy Koufax B-47 Stratojet 1957 World Series Anime Vietnamese language Fan (implement) Euphonium English language Gender-neutral language Vocoder Native American music Cello Socrate

i want to learn how to play the accorian but how where do i start should i get a book and a really cheap one from walmart to start out or what plz help yes i mean accordion sorry do you mean the ''accordion'' the instrument that is half piano e t c and you carry it on you're back if yes then you can start by reading this then later you can buy a book or get a teacher how to play the accordion the accordion is one of the most interesting instruments a combination of a piano keyboard with pull and push to get the sounds out of the according it takes strength and patience to play but once you learn you will enjoy it this is one instrument that can easily be taken with you to all party functions and makes a great accompaniment for sing a longs steps stand behind the accordion so that the piano keys are on your right facing away from you slip your arms into each strap so that the accordion is well supported on each shoulder once you are wearing the accordion slip your left hand underneath the smaller strap on the left side of the accordion now you are in position to play undo the safety buckles one on top and one on the bottom do not push or pull on the accordion yet while pressing down a key on the piano keyboard let the accordion fall open supporting it with your left hand the right side of the accordion does not move it is possible to play music and even perform knowing this much if you ever had piano lessons as a kid and you know your way around the keyboard you are ready to go try playing without looking down at your right hand from this angle it doesn't help much to look anyway so try to get comfortable with playing by feel sort of like typing without looking at your fingers feel under your left hand the bass and chord buttons are organized in rows parallel to the floor find the bass c button it will have a slight indentation and will be on the second row from the bellows some models have multiple buttons with indentations if yours is one of them the c is located in the middle of the bass panel again on the second row from the bellows hold down this button play a c scale with the right hand you'll notice that the accordion falls open much quicker than before and ultimately you will have to push with the left hand to continue to play after some practice this will become second nature eventually you won't have to think about pushing or pulling at all understand that the bass and chord functions in the left hand are a bit more complicated and require a simple knowledge of chord structure and theory the rows of buttons move up in fifths and down in fourths this makes it simple to play a song with a progression for example f and g are the buttons directly below and above respectively the middle c button there are six buttons in each row each row of buttons contains in order the third the root the root chord with the fifth in the base a minor third chord a dominant seventh chord and a diminished chord play around with these until you get comfortable with each key their respective chords and moving from row to row listen to different styles of accordion music to hear how the left hand is played for instance in a waltz it is common to alternate in the key of c between c and g on the down beats with the two upbeats being on the c chord button with g in the root the button immediately following middle c tips buying a book on how to play the accordion would help too though not as fun as learning via trial and error and by ear for simplicity's sake discussed here is the most commonly played accordion in the us the

oboe or clarinet or flute which to learn i would like to learn a new instrument and am unsure which would be best i know that i can get a tune out of oboe and clarinet but do like the sound of a flute which i have not tried i know how to read music and will teach myself as far as possible but would like this as a new hobby as i reach mid life crisis looking for advice from experinced musicians or those who can offer some advice as much as i'm sure you're enjoying reading about other people's experiences with the instrument it's not really good advice if you can play the clarinet then you don't really need to work on getting the reed to vibrate which is frustrating to most first time players with the flute however you could spend your first few hours playing with your mouth and never make a sound the oboe can take a very very long time to get a good sound out of and i wouldn't suggest making that your first instrument i'm sure you already know what you want to play just do what sounds best to you  Clarinet Reed (music) Oboe Transposing instrument Flute Embouchure Pet Sounds Harmonic series (music) Woodwind instrument Orchestra Concert band Musical instrument classification Mario Davidovsky Music of Brittany George Crumb Marching band Bassoon Big band Authentic performance Recorder Heitor Villa-Lobos Musical works of Mozart Timbre Bagpipes Vibrato Multiphonic Music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias Bass clarinet Louis Andriessen Johann Sebastian Bach Piano trio Rahsaan Roland Kirk Trombone Olivier Messiaen Philip Glass Musical ensemble Steve Reich Sergei Prokofiev Harmonica Brian Jones (musician) Native American music Giacinto Scelsi King Crimson Music history of the United States during the colonial era Resonance Key (music) Harmonium Original Dixieland Jass Band Henry Cow Tin whistle Synthesizer Mute (music) Sun Ra Music of the Republic of Macedonia Violin Music of immigrant communities in the United States Farfisa Western concert flute Baritone saxophone Music of Ireland C.G.

broadway i have always dreamed about being on broadway when i go to see shows in nyc i get chills that cover my body i watch in awe of the hardwork talent and energy that the stage evokes and portrays for the audience i not only enjoy watching broadway shows but also i like to perform in local shows i am a grand fan of show tunes and hopefully one day i will be able to sing some of these songs with the most talented people in nyc broadway performers but as much as i love theater the stage productions performing i do not want fame strongly dislike competition so i would not want to go and audition in the city for commercials and such my questions are how can i make it to broadway without fame if anyone out there has ever performed on broadway what advice and experience can you share with me how can i achieve my dream and still remain a normal person how can i work my way up to becoming worthy of the broadway stage what else can you share with me about broadway thanks i would not say that i hate competition but i fear it i am young and still confused about what to pursue and how to go about it all i know is i love theater does anyone who has ever been on broadway have any stories and or advice to share with me you don't necessarily need fame to get to broadway but you need talent you have to be passionate you have love what you're doing and you have to live for competition if you don't like the competition don't do it you'll never make an audition if you can't handle the competition if you don't have fame you're going to need experience start off broadway first and if you can make it there you can make it on the great white way a wise producer once told me that all of the talent was off broadway anyway when you feel that you are ready to jump on a broadway stage i know you probably feel like you can now but just humor me go to open casting calls they use these for major productions 'wicked' had theirs in chicago in late may 'rent' advertises theirs on playbill com i'm sure you can find more on sites like broadwayworld com and playbill com too about the equity card you don't need that either it's like actormyk said if you attain a job in an equity run theatre aka broadway or with an equity run company you automatically become equity so long as you hold an equity job and equity deems you 'worthy' of attaining the card and or you build up point towards the card basically land a spot in the theatre through an open audition and you become equity if that's wrong i know from experience that it's not far off and i was talking with some other actors who were trying desperately to explain it to me in theatrical terms that i understood but we were speaking two completely different languages and what one of us said the other one just stared smiled and nodded the downside to not being equity and going to an audition you have to wait and wait and wait until all of the members of equity have auditioned before you can go and actually show the auditioners maybe not a word but the word i use what you've got check out the actor's equity web site for more on that it's very helpful and once you become equity they post equity auditions on the site you want to know how to still be normal that's not tough to answer you're still you no matter what you do and you have to remember where you came from and who you really are i have a great family who when i forget myself and get a diva complex kick me back in gear until i feel about two inches tall and they make me build myself up again you probably have people like that in your life who would be more than willing to tell you that you have forgotten yourself and your place oh and broadway does not mean fame in this day in age you're a normal person to everyone even after they've seen your show there are a few die hard fans who only know broadway forget the movies these people do not go to the movie theater 'theatre' is spelled 'theatre and if it is not it is spelled incorrectly and ten dollars to watch a bunch of people on a flat screen is so un cool that they'd rather shell out the dough who get star struck and forget themselves and get giddy in the presence of their favorite broadway actor or actress most people are pretty much ignorant in the world of broadway and just sort of shun all of the stagedoorers again not a word unless you are are me i've been walking down the street on my off days and seen the fans lining up outside of the theatres after a matin e show or even after the late night show and heard star struck tourists asking excitedly why there's a crowd if i answer them they usually look disappointed say 'that entire crowd is waiting for that ' and roll their eyes before walking away makes you kind of angry really my best advice is go for it if you persevere you can do anything just because you have to wait tables to pay the rent or you get told by someone that you would have to lose eight sizes before they would even think of casting you or you think you did horribly at an audition doesn't mean you have to quit you might even find something you like more than acting while you are trying to get to where you want to be

am i a talented person i play the violin trumpet cello and trumbone i get all a's and i am a very fast learner i can draw good and i am good at math but i am not a geek i dont dress like one either i hide all of these skills so noo one knows about this except my teachers and my parents i want to start playing the electric guitar and i want to become a astronomer but i dont think im smart enough or ready to handle the pressure i wan tto go to art school and take more private lesson after school am i pushing my self to hard for all of this you do seem to have a lot going on there maybe concentrate on one area pick the one thing that gives you the most enjoyment the one thing you love the most the one thing you would want to do for the rest of your life even if you didn't get paid for it give that the most attention the others you can do as hobbies or side projects the pressure could be coming from the tension of trying to hide your talent keeping it under wrap is a lot of work in and of itself the skills you describe are meant to be shared and enjoyed by all when you open up and share who you are life becomes easier you can help yourself most by openly revealing yourself to others you can only know that much of yourself which you have the courage to confide to others the greatest gift you have to offer is always the truth when you fail to be honest hide who you truly are you hurt yourself before you can act in accordance with your true self you need to know who you are to know who you are you must communicate what you think and feel let people know what you do and how that makes you feel show your talent it is a gift given to you so you can give it back to the world  One Tree Hill (TV series) Magic (illusion) Jon Secada Current teachings of Prem Rawat Bass guitar Social rule Cello Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Self Portrait Violin Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Table tennis Characters in the Smurfs Alexander Technique Poker jargon Homeschooling Extreme Programming Boston Public Fast bowling Time Out of Mind Suzuki method Queen (band) Kodocha Highway 61 Revisited Summa Theologiae Theory of conduct The Adventures of Pete & Pete Rent (musical) Kender Education in the United States W.I.T.C.H.

another newbie violin question is it absolutely necessary to get a violin teacher go to violin classes when starting for the first time i realise it will make a huge difference but is it doable alone keep in mind i have no aspiration to play in an orchestra or become famous i would just like to have a competent ability skill in playing be able to play basics is this possible i'm a violin teacher so i can't believe i'm saying this but no you don't need a teacher my dad taught himself the violin it will be much more difficult by yourself and you are pretty much guaranteed to pick up bad habits but if you have no professional aspirations i don't see why you can't do it yourself it's just like skiing you can teach yourself but you'll get better faster with a teacher  Violin Martial art Alexander Technique Team Fortress Classic Teacher Sonata (music) Cello Suzuki method Clarinet Joke Snowboarding Tai Chi Chuan Niccol__ Paganini Education in Japan Education in the United States Education Itzhak Perlman The Fairly OddParents Education in Portugal Philosophical skepticism Social rule Orchestra Double bass Aikido Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China Olivier Messiaen Fast bowling Mauro Giuliani Timpani Secondary education in France Milton H.

what musical instrument can you play with small hands i have always wanted to learn how to play an instrument preferably not a woodwind one like the flute but i have always found it difficult because i have rather small hands and my fingers aren't that long when i spread out my fingers from thumb tip to pinky it is inches and the length of my middle finger from where the pslam knuckle meet up to the tip is inches i was wondering if there was an instrument that wouldn't be hard to learn play with small hands ah also i'm tone deaf when it comes to singing so voice doesn't work for me don't let your small hands deter you from choosing any instrument that people traditionally say you need long fingers for most people look at my hands i have long slender fingers and just naturally assume that is why i ended up playing guitar the fact is that great finger reach is almost never needed when playing the guitar andre segovia had fat short fingers and he played brilliantly with them pick an instrument based on your pleasure and you'll figure out what techniques you need to use to overcome reach limitations enjoy  Clarinet Double bass Flute Harp Saxophone Native American music Western concert flute Recorder Fast bowling Timpani Guitar Authentic performance Sitar Knife Tin whistle Hand Guqin Chopsticks String instrument Multiphonic Equine conformation Berimbau Classical music era Tablature Non-native pronunciations of English Andr__s Segovia Drill bit Louis Armstrong Transposing instrument Terminal ballistics Harmonica Hearing impairment Trumpet Horn (instrument) Old-time music Strap-on dildo Gesture Viola Trombone Humphrey Bogart Banjo Salad Fingers Brass instrument Musical instrument Music of Ireland Lute Blood on the Tracks Vibrato Embouchure Harmonic series (music) Sin City Milton H.

what vocal class do i belong to baritone or tenor my exact vocal range is from a b to a f without going into falsetto since falsetto doesnt coun't for male singers correct am i a tenor ii or am i a baritone many young men have that range it isn't the range that gives the definition to your voice but rather finding out where you feel the most comfortable if your passagio or gear shift into your higher voice comes at the f consistently and you feel happier singing in the upper middle register chances are you are a tenor if your passagio comes at the d and you feel that the last couple of notes are more work you might well be a baritone this is something that is highly subjective and of course without having heard you properly i'm just making an educated guess do you take lessons your teacher is the best person to ask if not try and corner your choir director for a few minutes and see if he she is competent enough to help you figure it out there is no glory to be won by being one or the other category there is a great deal of personal satisfaction to be won by knowing you are doing the right thing for your voice singing in the wrong category can eventually be harmful to the instrument so take your time and figure it out slowly if you are still in your teens this really will take a couple more years before your full bodily maturity is reached only then will it be safe to categorize you absolutely best wishes and keep on singing  Vocal range Saxophone Choir Singer Human voice Countertenor Falsetto Trumpet Infantilism Soprano Shaggy dog story The Wall Bagpipes Boyz II Men The Band Elton John Domestic violence Alto horn Clef Boy soprano Jon Secada Goodness and value theory Alto (voice) Vocal weight Utilitarianism Musical notation Castrato Songwriter Metaphor Eastern Orthodox Church The Beach Boys Big band Opera A Course In Miracles Condom Summa Theologiae Barbershop music The Creation Happiness The Beatles Guitar Theory of conduct Baritone saxophone The Dream of Gerontius The Emancipation of Mimi Sacred Harp Asperger syndrome The Jackson 5 Figured bass Bohemian Rhapsody Trombone Minnie Riperton Basso Rudy Vallee Tom Waits Objectivist philosophy Bing Crosby Parsifal We Belong Together Jewish music Native American music Marching band Pitaten Transposing instrument Musical instrument classification Clarinet Rigoletto (opera) Uilleann pipes Mike Patton Friedrich Schleiermacher Porgy and Bess Religion ABBA Goldberg Variations Value system Singing Mario Lanza Olivier Messiaen Fidelio The Four Tops The Jazz Singer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Temptations Blood on the Tracks Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Merit Contract Francis Crick Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Baroque music Mariah Carey Carmen Tosca Blackfoot music Captain Beefheart Human sexual behavior

cello help i have been playing cello for about months my teacher isn't that good so she doesn't really teach anything 'extra' so my question is how can i make my cello sound sweeter the only chord i can play okay is d but a sounds very loud and harsh then g c sounds blurry if you know what i mean the longrt the answers the better chords do you mean notes a chord is a series of three notes which would necessitate playing a double stop or triple stop two or three strings at the same time i believe you are talking about playing open strings at lest i hope so the cello is not really set up to play chords that's the reason the bridge is so rounded if you are having trouble with tone there are several things ayou may want to check is your bow primed when you first get your brand new bow you need to run it across your rosin from frog to tip about one hundred to one hundred and fifty times when the bow starts pulling against the rosin it is probably ready to try against the strings after that you should run it across the rosin four or five times every time you get ready to play how fresh are you strings many school and rental instruments have strings that have not been changed since the instrument was purchased strings are expensive so i don't say this lightly but if the windings are starting to separate or the string is starting to sound dead it might be time to change it you can also improve the sound of your strings by cleaning them if there is built up rosin on the bottom of the strings especially down towards the bridge it will definitely affect the way the instrument sounds is your sound post set properly look into the f hole and you should see a wooden dowel running up and down the center of the instrument almost right under where the bridge should be if you don't see the dowel or if the dowel is tilted or loose let your teacher know right away you may have a mute installed between the bridge and the tailpiece look at the strings on the other side of the bridge if there is a big black piece of rubber on there it is a mute and it might be muffling your tone you may not be bowing perpendicular to the instrument if you are bowing at an angle or swaying with your bow you are not going to get that sweet full sound you are looking for your teacher should be able to help you there if you have a couple extra minutes to spend or just make absolutely sure you are bowing straight across halfway between the fingerboard and the bridge there are two little notches at approximately the center of each f hole if your bridge is not set at the notches or is tilted in any way it will affect your sound also cello bridges can often warp which will move the strings too close to the fingerboard that will also deaden the sound one of the things you can do with little or no problem is to try out a friend's instrument or an instrument at the music store if you have the same problem with another instrument it is more likely to be your technique you need to examine if you can get a good sound on another instrument but not yours it is more likely to be your instrument i posted a few links to help get you started down towards the bottom there are sites that have free music and scales for the cello if you run out and need something more just give me a shout  Harp Guitar Bass guitar Mute (music) String instrument Big band Bow (music) Mandolin Musical terminology Timpani Poker jargon Viola Hurdy gurdy Harmonic series (music) Saxophone Double stop Fingerboard Upholstery Guqin Bassoon Gramophone record Drill bit Harmonica Sundial Billiards Shaggy dog story Fret Professional wrestling holds Santoor Slide guitar Archery Social rule Embouchure Berimbau Harmonic Blood on the Tracks Equine conformation Pinball Musical mode Vibrato Trombone Uilleann pipes Equal temperament Banjo Movie projector Tonality Floppy disk Orchestra Sonata form Mattress Krzysztof Penderecki Anchor English longbow 1957 World Series Harpsichord Viol Key (music) Sonata (music) Halting problem Legend of Zelda series songs Tablature Blues Glossary of partner dance terms Mario Davidovsky Olivier Messiaen Trumpet Volleyball Hardingfele Wood Bridge (stringed instrument) Japanese tea ceremony Trigonometric function International Phonetic Alphabet A Hard Day's Night (song) Bow (weapon) Chess terminology Fender Telecaster Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Electric Light Orchestra Old-time music Stairway Pet Sounds Glossary of nautical terms M16 (rifle) GunBound

i'm a beginning guitarist what is the best acoustic guitar to start out with as a beginner the best acoustic guitar that you could start out with in my opinion would be one that someone could loan you this will help you figure out not only what types you like how big neck width etc but it will help you really decide if you actually like the instrument it would be a shame to spend loads of money on a guitar and end up getting frustrated deciding you can't possibly make this instrument make a half decent note and have it end up in the attic but i found that buying one from a used guitar place is pretty good for when you feel that you are committed to this instrument and want one you can call your own the guitar i got was a slightly used wash burn guitar wash burns are not top of the line like fenders and gibson but are pretty good check for the appropriate size guitar body for you because of course you don't want one intended for a child so that when you play it looks like your playing a ukulele also check for the width across the neck where the strings are at the top can your hand fit comfortably around it small hands need small necks spanish styles guitars usually have a wider neck so big hands would be better for this one decide weather you are a lefty or a right left handed guitars shouldn't be hard to find in the more expensive stores but they can be harder to find a make you like that is also lefty in used guitar place try holding it ask for help if you need it from staff do you feel comfortable holding it strum it dose it sound good if it doesn't ask a staff member if they could tune it up for you once you picked one out ask about cases if they come with the guitar or are separate usually you get it with the guitar and if not they are about dollars they are a good investment to keep your guitar safe from scratches and such depending on how nice the staff is and how good of a barterer you are you could get the guitar and case for a reasonable amount i got both for plus some picks and a chord book free picks are cheap about cents each pick up a book with some chords on it don't go to expensive though you can get chords and tabs so songs on the internet for free personally i like this site easy to read got loads of songs http www ultimate guitar com practice like mad enough so you start to get callouses on your fingertips you'll know when you have them because it wont hurt you fingers when you press them on the strings take about months with regular guitar playing to get good ones once you get really good you can get a really cool guitar that can switch between acoustic and electric awesome really and amaze your friends good luck god bless happy playing  Electric guitar Violin Double bass Tablature Acoustic guitar Mandolin Banjo Twelve string guitar Jimi Hendrix Slide guitar Harp Ukulele Dobro Charango Fender Telecaster Pet Sounds Eddie Van Halen Social rule Floppy disk Highway 61 Revisited Bluegrass music Saxophone Stevie Ray Vaughan Brian Jones (musician) Pedal steel guitar Theory of conduct Clarinet Aerial (dance move) Time Out of Mind Equine conformation Poker jargon Menstrual cup Brian May Jazz Piano Cello Floyd Rose Handloading Hyperinflation Sampling (music) Queen (band) Textile manufacturing 1957 World Series Trey Anastasio Blues Strap-on dildo String instrument R.E.M.

do opera singers know italian german french etc or do they just focus on singing in one of the languages is there a different technique for singing in each language voice majors especially opera majors study french german and italian and english if it is not their native language they take diction classes in other languages that they might need such as russian etc my son a basso found it helpful to learn the cyrillic alphabet plus ipa the international phonetic alphabet that allows you to notate the sound of any human utterance since different languages have qualities of vowel and consonant production that differ yes you often need to use different vocal techniques the fundamental good rules of vocal production always apply but singing in french sure uses a different part of your mechanism than singing russian  International Phonetic Alphabet Vowel Phoneme Latin alphabet Bulgarian language Speech synthesis Russian language Non-native pronunciations of English Finnish language Phonetics Cyrillic alphabet Consonant Slovak language English language Arabic alphabet Phonetic transcription Pinyin Hangul Tone (linguistics) Voiceless glottal fricative Serbo-Croatian language Alphabet Greek language Latin spelling and pronunciation Korean language Diacritic Voiceless velar fricative Uvular trill Vowel length Polish language Romanian language Linguistics Vietnamese language Americanist phonetic notation Arabic language Russian phonology Italian language Liaison Spelling reform German language Slovenian language Stop consonant Writing system Hebrew language Tamil language Initiation (phonetics) Yer Tatar language Schwa Proto-Indo-European language Serbian language Ukrainian language Esperanto Nasal consonant Diaeresis Affricate consonant Z Voiceless bilabial plosive Dutch language Danish language French language Gothic language Voiceless postalveolar affricate Tlingit language Belarusian language Phonation Ubykh language Uralic Phonetic Alphabet Hebrew alphabet Palatalization Thai alphabet Transliteration Lithuanian language Swedish language Bengali language Hindi Chinese language NATO phonetic alphabet Romanization Figured bass Labial-velar approximant English as an additional language Keyboard layout American English Velar nasal Wolof language Russian orthography Yoruba language Palatal nasal Voiceless alveolar affricate Esperanto as an international language Language

i'm becoming the stage manager at my high school does anyone have any tips get organized the main job of the stage manager is to keep the performance running smoothly from start to finish you'll need to know a lot about what's going on in all the different areas is the house ready for the performance audience seated lights out are the actors in place for their entrances this extends throughout the performance lots of actors forget entrances and you'll have to chase them down props in place stage hands ready for the next set change lighting techs ready for the next cue sound effects you name it it's a big job but if you can manage it you'll be rewarded with a super successful show you should also know that it's one of the most thankless jobs in show business you have a huge amount of responsibility and practically no visibility to the audience the cast may hate you because you have to be bossy to them the only people whose respect you will earn for a job well done are the director and the rest of the stage crew but at the end of the show if you've helped make the show work the cast will probably be very thankful  Stage management Whose Line Is It Anyway?

question related to guitar the strings of my guitar has drifted apart from the fretboard means there is a lot of gap b w strings and fretboard which makes it difficult to play is the neck of my guitar bent how can u tell whether the neck of the guitar is bent if it is can it be rectified and in future how to avoid this to happen thanks in advance its an acoustic o cut guitar and the shopkeeper told me that has a bent neck without giving it a look so i don't believe him the shopkeeper told you it's a bent neck because this is the only reason the action will rise like you have described it's a very common problem with guitars better guitars have an adjustable truss rod in the neck which your repair shop will know how to adjust to restore the proper action to your guitar if the guitar is a less expensive model it may not have such an adjustment available in that case the guitar could be repaired but the repair would cost more than the guitar is worth and should only be considered if the guitar has some particular sentimental value to you you can tell if the neck is bent by lying the guitar flat on a table and looking at it from the bottom end with your eye at the level of the strings from this vantage point the warp of the neck will become evident neck warping often occurs if the guitar experiences extremes in heat and humidity in storage be careful where you keep your guitar don't leave it in the attic or in hot cars for extended periods don't store it near the radiator etc if you're going to put your guitar in storage for an extended period loosen the strings to reduce the tension on the neck and consider getting a dehumdifier for your case this is just a device that contains a chemical dessicant to reduce the moisture in your case you'll need to keep the guitar stored in the closed case when not in use  Guitar Violin Cello Double bass Harp Fender Telecaster Oscilloscope Thermal power station Equine conformation Piano Estoppel Fret Floyd Rose Twelve string guitar Textile manufacturing Drill bit Nuclear power Slide guitar Welding Energy development Electric guitar Spark plug Seismic retrofit String theory Nuclear reactor Microeconomics Classical guitar Urinary incontinence Carburetor Acoustic guitar Inflation Supply and demand Social rule Lap steel guitar Mattress Hyperinflation Handloading Hydrogen economy Rail terminology Tire Time travel Guitar/synthesizer Solar cell Fire fighting Lute Disc brake Black hole Floppy disk Intonation Harmonica Hurdy gurdy Explosive material Prostate cancer Aluminium CPU cache Pedal steel guitar Internal ballistics String instrument Spacecraft propulsion Naval mine U.S. 1st Cavalry Division Chernobyl accident Rod Stewart Eddie Van Halen Table saw Blood on the Tracks Surveillance Bassoon C programming language Tablature John Myung Lighting Timpani Wind power Redundant array of independent disks Diving Saxophone Aerial (dance move) Clarinet Plastic Professional wrestling attacks Radiation therapy CPU design Password Gramophone record Transformer Mandolin Incandescent light bulb Ionizing radiation Sitar Buddy Guy

how can stop being nervous when i have to do a stage performance we all know what stage fright is and i don't know of anyone who has never gotten it sometime in their life i our worked in radio and tv for more than years and i can tell you this about stage fright even now if i have to get up and speak in front of a group of people in a live audience i get nervous something that never happened when i was looking into a camera or sitting in front of a microphone many of the top entertainers in the world say they've gotten stage fright too so don't feel as if stage fright only happens to you famous people who are known to have suffered from serious stage fright include barbra streisand donny osmond kim basinger and even sir laurence olivier stage fright symptoms are probably caused by adrenalin a k a epinephrine which is a hormone commonly associated with fear when the brain perceives danger or a stressful situation arises adrenalin starts pumping and anxiety increases symptoms of stage fright include a general feeling of anxiety before or during the beginning of a speech or presentation cold hands sweating hands or shaky hands dry mouth fast pulse nausea rapid breathing shaky knees tight throat trembling lips stage fright and the symptoms that go with it lessen as you become more accustomed to speaking in front of groups of any size but even veteran public speakers agree it never goes away completely so if you're going to enjoy any success making a presentation you have to learn to control stage fright to some degree to the best of our knowledge no one has ever died as a result of stage fright but you can find plenty of surveys that say most people would rather die than give a speech if that sounds like you follow some of the advice and strategies below comfort yourself in the knowledge that even veteran speakers get stage fright if it happens of barbra streisand and kim basinger what do the rest of us have to be ashamed of understand that a little stage fright is actually good it gets your adrenalin going and that will help you keep your energy level up that's a good thing build your confidence with rehearsals if you practice practice and practice some more you'll eventually feel so comfortable with your material that you won't stress out about the possibility of embarrassing yourself visualize success see yourself doing well imagine audience members applauding and coming up to you afterward to pat you on the back and shake your hand don't visualize failure avoid dwelling on any bad speaking experiences you've had in the past and don't think about disasters suffered by people you know remember some important basics be well rested and relaxed arrive early check out any audio visual equipment well in advance you can't always eliminate stage fright and nervousness all together and as i pointed out in tip number you probably don't want to but you don't want it to paralyze you either follow the steps above and you find that going on stage is no longer something to fear  Hypoglycemia Traumatic brain injury Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Obsessive-compulsive disorder Sleep Post-traumatic stress disorder Urinary incontinence Drowning Equine conformation Diabetes mellitus Decompression sickness Epinephrine Cancer Shaggy dog story First aid Agoraphobia The Band Myocardial infarction Stress (medicine) Hyperthermia Chronic fatigue syndrome Premature ejaculation Milton H.

where can i find the best agent i'm really into acting and i really need to get an agent i don't live anywhere near hollywood talent agents for actors come in two main types theatrical television and film and commercial for commercials there are also dance print and voice over agents who specialize in these fields and signing with one of these agents can be a great way for actors with these other skills to cross over into one of the other areas being with the same agency for everything is called being signed across the board but many actors prefer to have separate agents for different types of work become some agencies might be strong commercially but not as strong theatrically or vice versa agents get information about auditions for roles either directly from casting directors and producers calling them asking for client submissions or from a fax email service called the breakdowns a daily list of roles being cast sent only to agents and managers although there is a black market for this information within the acting community and many actors without representation self submit for available roles which some casting people don't mind others hate and the owner of breakdown services abhors remember actors your agents work for you but they only get of what you make so that means you need to do of the work especially when you are getting started that means always be professional know your craft don't shy away from networking and letting cd producers and directors know about your accomplishments upcoming appearances by sending out postcards know your type and how you fit into the current market and above all make sure you and your agent are on the same page about what kinds of parts you will be submitted for and never pay an agent or manager up front to represent you they only make money when they make you money the plan of attack most agents refuse any off the street drop ins in other words they'll see new talent by appointment only don't bother phoning in for one just yet because without a face you're just another voice and unless that voice is absolutely incredible and the agent handles a lot of voice over work it simply won't get you in instead mail off your photo and resume along with a very special cover letter what makes that letter so special simple prove that you understand how valuable their time is so many people try cramming in their whole hopes and dreams autobiography into the cover letter it resembles a chapter from a novel the agent hasn't the time nor the interest to be a publisher any submission that takes more than seconds to scan through and read will likely be filed in the trash here's a sample of how to keep it short wannabe talent hopeful avenue dreamland bc attn ms a gent please accept my photos and resume for possible consideration of future representation i will contact your offices next week to verify your receipt of this package thank you very much for your time johnny smartguy that's it nothing else just plain and simple the agent even has seconds left to take a quick glance at your photo s and stats now the big trick comes the following week give it a full week before calling in and try to make the call on a tuesday or wednesday when they may be less frantic in the office just call up and say hi my name's johnny smartguy and i'm just calling to confirm you received my photo and resume chances are you'll get a response of the agents will be looking at it or there are no openings right now try back in a few months or even the infamous the agents will call you back if they're interested whatever the response simply answer no problem i don't want to take up your time i just promised i would make sure the package got there okay i don't want to keep you thank you very much for your time pause they'll either be impressed and relieved at the short conversation or they'll be caught so off guard that they'll try to explain further if they haven't said goodbye then just repeat a variation of your previous words always offering them the opportunity to end the conversation and reinforcing that you know their time is valuable they're so used to the can i come in pleading that you've really thrown them for a loop by not asking them for something call the better business bureau to see if any complaints have been made against the agency tips warnings agents making their living by earning a percentage of each job they book for a model do not pay any up front fees to an agent if you're not happy with the number of auditions or bookings you are getting set up an appointment with your agent and discuss what you can do to generate more jobs if the agent lies to you makes outrageous promises or asks for up front money to cover phone calls or mailing expenses on your behalf keep looking legitimate agents do not ask for expense money go to the website link below it is the screen actors guild agent list for both sag franchised and non franchised

what to look for in a piano concerto i am starting to learn my first concerto is there a special characteristic that is associated with concertos any tips and suggestion thanks a concerto is a piece written for solo or soli more than one instrument s with orchestral accompaniment most recordings you get of a concerto will have an orchestra as the accompaniment since most of us don't have a full orchestra at our disposal then the accompaniment part has been adapted for piano when you perform this piece at a recital or competition there will be two pianos one for you the soloist and one one for the accompanist concertos typically consist of three movements the first movement is usually more technical and quite flashy the second mvmt is typically slower and lyrical and the third mvmt is usually quite upbeat like a dance or jig with a big finish find a few recordings of the piece by different artists everyone interprets pieces differently make sure you get all three movements if you plan on learning all of them itunes is a great source and its cheap familiarize yourself with how it sounds do everything your teacher says the way your teacher says even it seems superfluous go slow with the technical sections and don't try to rush up to the performance tempo before you're ready make the metronome your new best friend the pickier and more precise you can be while learning a new piece the more headache you'll save later on i also find it very helpful to do some research on the composer of the piece and find out why he she wrote it and what was going on in the world or in his her life when it was written this helps me gain insight into how the piece should be interpreted good luck on this major endeavor and important milestone in your musical career  Sonata form Philip Glass Tempo Sonata (music) Johann Sebastian Bach Musical works of Mozart Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven) Brandenburg concertos Piano concerto Sergei Rachmaninoff Symphony Double bass Henry Cowell John Cage Cello Joseph Haydn Classical music era Maurice Ravel Nikolai Karlovich Medtner Viola Anton Bruckner Olivier Messiaen Music genre Bassoon Felix Mendelssohn Orchestra Program music Igor Stravinsky Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Soloist Performance (without orchestra) Blues Vladimir Horowitz Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky Glenn Gould Baroque music Edward Elgar Fugue Song Klezmer Violin Concerto (Beethoven) Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Heitor Villa-Lobos Choir Charles Ives Bass clarinet Grammy Award Harpsichord Luciano Berio Clarinet Concerto (Mozart) The Creation Big band Edvard Grieg Yo-Yo Ma Piano Concerto No. 20 (Mozart) Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji Conducting Piano Concerto No. 23 (Mozart) Violin Ralph Vaughan Williams George Gershwin Arnold Schoenberg Piano Ern__ Dohn__nyi Concert band Salsa music Music of Brittany Leonard Bernstein Orchestration Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven) Sinfonia Elliott Carter Elodie Lauten Steve Reich Violin Concerto (Berg) Romantic music Jean Sibelius Turkish music (style) Benjamin Britten Violin concerto Martha Argerich Goldberg Variations Grammy Awards of 1960 Camille Saint-Sa__ns Native American music

how do you write for banjo can they pick ths or just do chords what's the range for banjo is it hard to move fast as a pianist i'm not sure what would be too difficult for the average player a banjo can play anything that a guitar can and has i would recommend that you look at a program called tabledit powertab editor freeware or guitar pro i use four but i think that five and maybe six is out now they do a combination of notation and tablature most folk and bluegrass banjo players only read tablature although many ragtime and classical classical banjo players still read notation just fine remember that the banjo was the instrument of choice in pit bands before amplification equalized the volume level of the guitar with the other instruments the other thing you want to consider is the type of banjo you are writing for are you going to use a five string bluegrass style four string tenor banjo six string banjo tuned like a guitar or dobro banjolin tuned like a mandolin two courses of four strings g d a e same as the violin or banjolele tuned like a ukulele with a banjo head on it a banjo player can play single line melody chords fingerstyle or any combination of these styles the only limitation a banjo really has is imposed by the person playing it if you have any doubt check out bela fleck and the flecktones john mckuen from the nitty gritty dirt band check out the classical tunes he plays on banjo especially steve martin yes the comedian and jerry van dyke yes another comedian brother of dick van dyke and an excellent flailing banjo player flailing is playing chord melody while moving the plectrum pick back and forth in a tremolo style very rapidly hope this helps  Mandolin Bluegrass music Harmonica Tablature Violin Music genre Double bass Music of Ireland Old-time music B__la Fleck Ukulele String instrument Blood on the Tracks Acoustic guitar Grateful Dead Trey Anastasio Lute Fingerpicking B__la Fleck and the Flecktones Jazz Slide guitar Steve Martin Music Tony Rice Ragtime American popular music Guqin Country music New Grass Revival Plectrum Dixieland Phish Floyd Rose Eddie Van Halen Vibrato Jazz guitar Classical music era Tremolo Music of the United States Romantic music Musical terminology Heavy metal music Grammy Awards of 2005 The Country Gentlemen Sitar Harp Clawhammer Pedal steel guitar Bouzouki Vibraphone Vassar Clements The Beatles Samples of music from the United States Authentic performance Piano Electronic organ Viol Lap steel guitar Hurdy gurdy Pet Sounds Jimi Hendrix Jerry Garcia Timpani Music of Hawaii Metal music Clarinet Emmylou Harris Cuatro Music of Arizona Trombone Cittern Charango Chord (music) Music theory Big band Django Reinhardt Cello Grammy Awards of 1990 Gary Rossington Balalaika Power chord Brian May O Brother, Where Art Thou?

i would like to learn to play the guitar which is easier bass or an acoustic theres a difference between bass and a traditional string guitar if your really dedicated to it i would suggest you learn on acoustic once you start learning playing an electric will be much easier they are the same music wise except acoustic guitars have thicker strings and wider frets bass is a whole different subject bass is easier to learn how to play than guitar if you can play guitar you can play bass but it doesn't work the other way around  Bass guitar Guitar Double bass Twelve string guitar Fret Bluegrass music Slide guitar Tablature Violin Mandolin Acoustic bass guitar String instrument Electric guitar Blood on the Tracks Clarinet Old-time music Michael Hedges Viola Lap steel guitar Musical ensemble Banjo Sitar Cello Electric violin Guitar pick Acoustic guitar Chapman Stick Classical guitar Dobro Harmonica George Crumb Pickup (music) John Myung Fender Blonde on Blonde Instrument amplifier Dixieland Seven-string guitar Electric Light Orchestra Jimi Hendrix Joy Division (band) Transposing instrument Phil Collins Lute Jethro Tull (band) Blues Billy Sheehan Fingerboard Harp Stanley Jordan Bringing It All Back Home Nu metal John Deacon Tapping Louis Andriessen Synthesizer Jaco Pastorius Never for Ever Rickenbacker Vibrato Pedal steel guitar Viol Rhythm guitar Chick Corea Spike (Elvis Costello album) Eddie Van Halen Pet Sounds Piano Focus (album) Marching band Time Out of Mind The Cure Ulver Drone (music) The Band Adam Jones Keller Williams Mario Davidovsky Trey Anastasio Arcturus (band) The Globe Sessions Buddy Guy Sea Change Back To Bedlam Rock band Authentic performance Mahavishnu Orchestra Grateful Dead Flute Randy Rhoads Electric upright bass James Jamerson C'mon C'mon Anton Webern Car Wheels on a Gravel Road Stevie Ray Vaughan Brian Jones (musician) One Wish: The Holiday Album Music of Ireland

would it be wierd if i added snares to my piece gretsch i found a nice little dw side snare x and a pacific snare x to go with a pork pie little squealer x but i can't tell wether or not to buy them all to replace my current birch snare do what you want to it's your set i know of one jazz cat who had snares on everything but his tenor toms and bass he liked the sound he got with brushes who knows he never had a night off so i guess it worked for him have you added a tenor tom to the left behind your high hat yet that is also a really effective piece and a real show stopper when you half stand and play the toms to the left and right of you i used to have a high hat with a sizzle cymbal on top and a lead plate on the bottom man could that thing put out some sounds it can also be very effective to get one of those center mounted high hats you really have to squeeze it in there between the snare and the alto toms but it makes for some really effective cross sticking never hurts to get triggers placed in the drums along with built in mikes if you are looking for different sounds you might as well go whole hog and plug in a sound bank mixing a taste of the synthisized sounds with your acoustic kit can really blow the room away best of luck no matter what you decide to do  Drum kit Marching percussion Big band Snare drum Mike Portnoy Hi-hat DrumMania Timpani Bass drum Tom-tom drum Trombone Saxophone Harmonica Percussion instrument Marching band Double bass Bass guitar Clarinet Pet Sounds Wrigley Field 2Step Trapping Bouncy techno Danny Carey Blonde on Blonde Flute King Crimson Herbie Hancock Drum and bugle corps (modern) Trey Anastasio Electric guitar Jon Theodore Clef Concert band Neil Peart Highway 61 Revisited Violin House music Streetlight Manifesto Grateful Dead Guitar Jethro Tull (band) Empire Burlesque Cello Maureen Tucker Magical objects in Harry Potter Drum stick Drum 1957 World Series Travis Barker Hip hop music Western concert flute Hornbostel-Sachs Tris Speaker Ride cymbal Disco Sampling (music) Microphone Roland TR-808 Bolero (Ravel) Winning Streak Blink-182 Songs in the Key of Life Hatful of Hollow Genesis (band) Synthesizer Animal Crossing The Four Tops Real Love (song) Pat Metheny Drum and bass John Coltrane Rabbit Sizzle cymbal Electronic drumming Mike Watt Buck Fever The Velvet Underground March (music) Blood on the Tracks John Frusciante Lars Ulrich Tom Waits Harp The Waterboys Miles Davis Paul Is Dead Incubus (band) Bassoon Roland TR-909 Curling Bagpipes Placebo (band) Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band High on the Hog Uilleann pipes

in final destination how does the kid who gets blown up by the grill get on deaths list he is on death list but he is not in the pile up and f hwould not have survivors had not survived then he would not be helping out kat and the car would have hit him okay the long answer is chaos theory basically put all random events tie into each other short answer he was destined to die by getting hit by a car he was saved and as a consequence all actions that were interrelated to his got skewed chaos theory so death had to reshuffle things pick a time and place to take this kid out and thankfully he did it in a very entertaining way another way to look at is that every event interrelated to his dying would have theoretically been altered or postponed if you want to delve into physics and another little giggler of a hypothetical theory of many worlds which like chaos theory states that for every action take every possible outcome of those actions will be played out through an infinite number of realities so boy doesn't die reality as it was supposed to play out doesn't so our reality skews along a different time line see back to the future ii to get things back to were they were supposed to be with him dying and the infinite number of lives that each event touched from his death to god knows what death just rewrote the script kid got killed our reality adjusts and the world moves on wrap you mind around that one time will ya  Determinism Theory of conduct Causality Incarnations of Immortality The nature of God in Western theology Immortality Free will Time travel Theory Blackjack Randomness Intelligent design Meaning of life Friedrich Schleiermacher Donald Davidson (philosopher) Supergirl Special relativity EPR paradox G__del's incompleteness theorem Bubble Bobble Many worlds and possible worlds in literature and art Shawn Michaels Reality Normal distribution Law of value Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Occam's Razor Fischer Random Chess Dynamical system Karl Popper Goodness and value theory Microeconomics Origin belief Physics Scientific method Time Philosophy of space and time Episodes of Lost (Season 1) End of civilization Infinity The Invisibles Legacy of Kain Father's Day (Doctor Who) Speed of light Game theory Warcraft III Religion Infinite monkey theorem Faster-than-light Professional wrestling Probability theory Information warfare Consciousness German grammar Extensive form game The Dark Tower (series) Human nature Philosophy of language Hardware random number generator Soul Many-worlds interpretation Magic (paranormal) Reincarnation Grant Morrison Metaphysics Sin City Simone Weil Grandfather paradox Black hole Immanuel Kant Assassination David Hume The Amber Spyglass The Chronicles of Amber Survivor (novel) Scientology beliefs and practices Social psychology Game programmer Mafia (game) Supernatural Glen Jacobs Philosophy of science Naruto jutsu The Butterfly Effect Vegeta Socrates Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)

i need a good beginners violin and music book any recommendations my first and best response is to ask your instructor the book that he or she teaches from is going to make both of you the most comfortable if tht is not an option the essential elements for strings has both a dvd with basic holding media and a cd to play along with it has most of the basics and will get you started i also like the all for strings method put out by alfred but it does not have the dvd if i can be of any further assistance just give me a shout as far as a beginners violin i really like the cremona vl or you can find other ones locally and again i would ask your instructor first and always but if that is not an option try folk of the wood dot com  Violin Bass guitar Parachuting Berimbau BASIC programming language Viola B__la Bart__k Cello Cremona West Coast Swing Clarinet Contredanse String instrument Dmitri Shostakovich Harp Guitar Mandolin Old-time music Double bass Juilliard School Sonata (music) Bow (music) Anchor George Crumb Reversi Strap-on dildo Suzuki method Python programming language Antonio Stradivari Claudio Monteverdi Graduate school Dog training Aikido Drill instructor Visual Basic Coin magic Objective-C Tag Mario Davidovsky Zolt__n Kod__ly Charles Ives Hello world program King Crimson Dots and Boxes Gymnasium (Denmark) Igor Stravinsky Bash The Band Authentic performance Fife (musical instrument) Piano trio Magic (illusion) Antonio Vivaldi Oops!...

where can i find trombone sheet music for free hey i was hoping some of you can tell me where i can find free trombone euphonium sheet music i'd really would like zelda or mario bros theme but anything is fine thanks rarely will you find nintendo music for trombone euphonium baritone most of the stuff that is posted on the web is written for piano if you want to play the melody learn how to read treble clef because that's generally what the melody is written in a plus of finding piano music also is that you can tinker around with your own arrangements for example i was able to quickly arrange a clarinet duet for the mario themes just by transposing a piano score as for where to get the sheet music it is quite difficult to find them for free usually a google image search will suffice for me just type in whatever game you want and sheet music and there you go enjoy  Clef Transposing instrument Trombone Koji Kondo Video game music Euphonium Sheet music Brass band Saxophone Big band Clarinet Buck Fever Super Mario 64 Concert band Trumpet Bolero (Ravel) Igor Stravinsky Daigasso!

is it necessary do you feel that it is hard for the baby musicians in youth orchestras to play the big and heavy horns such as bassoon flugelhorn french horn tuba wagner horn euphonium mellophones if you agree there is a big demand for the small instruments for kids pls vote of the brass you listed only a tuba would be obnoxious to play for a little kid but you can buy a holder for it so that's not that much of a problem bassoon would be difficult because it requires great hand dexterity and the fingering holes are rather spread out as compared to clarinet flute etc but then usually a bassoon is not seen in small kid bands  Clarinet Orchestra Brass instrument Transposing instrument Brass band Trombone Bassoon Concert band Euphonium Tuba Marching band Louis Andriessen Trumpet Serpent (instrument) Musical ensemble Embouchure Saxophone Harmonic series (music) Alto horn Authentic performance Flute Mute (music) Bass clarinet Heitor Villa-Lobos Wagner tuba Mellophone Sketches of Spain Disco Drum and bugle corps (modern) Big band Woodwind instrument Musical works of Mozart Piano trio Music of immigrant communities in the United States Music history of the United States to the Civil War Quintet Double bass The Rite of Spring Adolphe Sax Parsifal Baritone saxophone Musical instrument classification Roy Wood The Firebird Musician Contrabassoon Igor Stravinsky Bolero (Ravel) Western concert flute Symphony No. 8 (Mahler) Symphony No. 1 (Havergal Brian) Flugelhorn C.G.

iv heard about a piano class that teaches u how to play by listening is that possible iv seen an add bfore saying that there is a new way of giving out piano lessons to student which is by teaching the student to listen to the song tht he she likes then try to hit the right keys its weird tho bcs im learning piano myself and i cant seem to see the possibilities in dat iv had a friend who said its possible as he had tried it before actually this is called learning by rote and i'm not going to tell you that it doesn't work because it obviously does it is a slow cumbersome way to learn but it does have it's advantages especially if you are dysfunctional dyslexic dysgraphic or you are visually impaired if you have no learning or visual impairments however it would be in your best interest to learn notation simply because it is faster and enables you to talk to other musicians thus using your time more efficiently some famous musicians who had to learn by rote are paul mccartney dyslexic stevie wonder and ray charles visually impaired i am mentioning this because i do not want you to think i am being playful or sarcastic there are situations where this is a perfectly legitimate way to learn  Dyslexia Blind musicians Learning disability John Cage Herbie Hancock Steve Reich Stevie Wonder She Loves You Layla Harmonic series (music) Suzuki method Olivier Messiaen Asperger syndrome Second language acquisition Blindness The Beatles John Mayer (musician) Highway 61 Revisited Hearing impairment Visual Basic Brian Jones (musician) European classical music George Harrison The Beatles' influence Jazz Songwriter Blonde on Blonde Louis Armstrong Real Love (song) Music lesson Marching band Sonata form Yesterday (song) Python programming language Yoko Ono A Day in the Life George Gershwin Blood on the Tracks Musical mode Backward message Aphasia Past teachings of Prem Rawat Software engineering Charles Ives I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Music Hey Jude Guqin "Weird Al" Yankovic Philosophy of language Richard Feynman Bringing It All Back Home Franz Schubert The Long and Winding Road American Sign Language Clarinet Dyscalculia Goldberg Variations Joseph Haydn I Want to Hold Your Hand Stop and Smell the Roses Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Authentic performance Singlish Witold Lutos__awski A Hard Day's Night (song) MP3 Eric Clapton Piano Capoeira Slow Train Coming Sonata (music) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Ragtime Buddy Guy Grunge music Weebl and Bob Swedish allotment system Little Britain Carnatic music The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Shot of Love German grammar Strategic management Eleanor Rigby Bowl Championship Series W.

how do i get famous i have a really great voice but i have no idea how to get discovered how do i get a record deal or on t v first of all you must get the glam out of the way and the stars out of your eyes i m not saying get rid of them because that is what is going to be your driving force just put them aside for a moment and focus on the bigger picture get your feet planted in reality before you reach for the stars the days of the artist development deal are past because of budget restraints recording companies no longer sign aspiring artist to develop them in hopes of making a profit in the future you have to go to them with some kind of experience gaining success in the entertainment business is no different than gaining success in any other job think about the job market today and what the experts recommend doing in gaining the position that you want you have to sell yourself to the employer make known the skills you bring and how they will benefit the employer in short what can you do for the company like any business the reason for a talent agency or record company being in business is to make a profit they want to be convinced that you your music is going to sell now the question becomes how do i show a record label or talent agency that i can make them money how can you prove your ability to produce a profit for them first make sure you truly have talent or at least the potential otherwise you are wasting your time and will be very disappointed when you discover the truth these are the things to do to prove to the major record companies that you have what it takes it is all in the vain of the indie movement self promotion what a record company is looking for is evidence of success have prior recording experience producing a product that has sold without a distribution deal or in store presence promoted yourself to radio stations enough to get air play of your material sell downloads of your material without the use of a service i e itunes have an official website not a myspace that draws thousands of visitors not hits each and every month consistently draw large crowds to your shows get great media coverage in advance of every major show have a fan base actively working to promote your shows draw a good percentage of your income from merchandise sales you may say well there are others who made it without having to work so hard yes occasionally you will find a band or a singer who has enormous talent and they will not have to work so hard they are the exception and not the rule but if you want what you say that you want you must be willing to work in that direction in today s market having your own evidence of success is the only guaranteed way to get yourself signed  Therion (band) Unemployment Spice Girls Garth Brooks Advertising UK Singles Chart TLC Delta Goodrem Record label Insurance Wal-Mart Rock (music) Apple Computer Nintendo CBS Microeconomics Minor league baseball Illegal drug trade Otakon Productive and unproductive labour ABBA Grunge music Marketing Management Pop punk 50 Cent Prince (artist) Queen (band) Peter Gabriel ITV MTV Copyleft Privatization Surplus value Ford Motor Company Indie rock Internet fraud Capital accumulation Selling out Tesco Kylie Minogue Computer and video game industry Electronic commerce The Jackson 5 Prices of production Amway Publishing United Kingdom corporation tax Live 8 Citigroup Jimmy Eat World Baseball Copyright KISS (band) World Wrestling Entertainment David Bowie Roxette Tori Amos Technocratic movement Aerosmith Dorama Professional wrestling slang Plame affair Economics Short selling Keynesian economics We Belong Together Pink Floyd Life insurance ITunes Journey (band) Billboard Hot 100 Apple Macintosh Anarchism and capitalism Contract Strategic management Najwa Karam FairTax Nuclear power Blackjack United Artists World Championship Wrestling Political economy The Apprentice 2 Law of value Van Halen Online music store The Supremes Pharmaceutical company Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Sears Holdings Corporation

how do i make up a guitar solo i can play a ton of stuff that other people wrote after a while it's all just more of the same so i started making up my own stuff and while i can string chord progressions together i get completely bogged down trying to come up with any kind of solo where do i begin the important thing to remember is to play from your heart yes cheesy i know but also in order to write great guitar solos like so many rockers before you you have to bear in mind that they played the notes that sent chills down their spine most people don't realize that most solos were discovered just by goofing around your heart can tell you when a solo is right pick up your guitar and play it no particular strings just play any note you think up when you hit a certain chord sequence or something similar your heart will give a certain shudder build off of the chord sequence until you have your solo if your heart pounds at one sequence but slows at another take out the one that slows your heart etc the same thing happens to me on the saxophone when i play notes that no one has ever written down in the same order before i can always depend on my heart to tell me what greatness can come from it and sorry for making this answer sound like the end of a cheesy disney movie just play by your heart it wont let you down  Phil Collins Chord (music) Double bass Buddy Guy Bluegrass music Key (music) Self Portrait 10cc Twelve string guitar Blonde on Blonde Big band Guitar Musical mode Shine On You Crazy Diamond Harmonica Bass guitar Empire Burlesque Figured bass Video game music Slide guitar Heavy metal music Blood on the Tracks The Who She Loves You Trey Anastasio Eddie Van Halen Musical terminology Supertramp Rod Stewart Sampling (music) Rich Mullins Umphrey's McGee Jazz Goldberg Variations Violin Tonality Red Hot Chili Peppers The Beatles Chick Corea Journey (band) Slow Train Coming Mandolin Britpop Jam band Steely Dan Hey Jude Brian Jones (musician) Wes Montgomery Tai Chi Chuan Pet Sounds Blues Nu metal Power chord Rock (music) Bohemian Rhapsody Albert King Death Cab for Cutie Musical notation The Isley Brothers Pedal steel guitar Syd Barrett Bringing It All Back Home A Hard Day's Night (song) Steve Reich Elton John Timpani Notable lines in the Star Wars series Acoustic guitar Split Enz Rhythm guitar Synthesizer Nine Inch Nails Cuatro Chicago (band) 1957 World Series Iggy Pop Sex Pistols Herbie Hancock Roxette Street-Legal Please Please Me Sonata (music) Jon Secada Layla Electric guitar Harp Crazy Little Thing Called Love Echoes (1971 song) I Want to Hold Your Hand They Might Be Giants Songwriter Joe Pass Mike Watt Brian May Highway 61 Revisited Vowel

does anyone know where i can find the recordings of the french horn etudes for tmea region band auditions i just got my region music today and i would like to start practicing and recordings would be a huuuuuge help usually etudes aren't recorded by professional artists they're just little study guides for practice if recordings do exist they'll probably come with the book in which the etudes are contained if you got the etudes as audition material you probably just got photocopies of the music right search out the book they came from from a music store and maybe they'll have a recording although i really doubt it my best advice to you is to get a few private lessons with a teacher they'll be able to play it for you so you can hear what it's supposed to sound like good luck  Music Etude Timpani TLC Suzuki method Robert Schumann No Doubt Red Hot Chili Peppers Black Sabbath Sampling (music) Sly & the Family Stone Soul music King Crimson Philosophical skepticism The Monkees KISS (band) Dave Grohl Alex Chilton Therion (band) Street-Legal Ferruccio Busoni Chet Atkins Accountancy Clarinet Johann Philipp Reis Record producer Blonde on Blonde The Beatles bootlegs Philip Glass Clements High School Bon Jovi Music lesson French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools John Coltrane Randy Rhoads Lindy Hop The Waterboys Girls Aloud Music theory Whitney Houston Roxette Tony Bennett Beyond Shadows Saxophone Mixtape Empire Burlesque Ska Carl Barks Captain Beefheart Marching band Music of Jamaica Bastard pop Social rule Aesthetic Realism Igor Stravinsky Selling out Daryl Hall Pain of Salvation Japanese tea ceremony Henry Cow Journey (band) Copy protection Martial art Bee Gees Leopold Godowsky Education in the United States Ontological argument ISO 9000 Gy__rgy Ligeti The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Paul Is Dead Industrial music Lostprophets C__line Dion Quarashi Craps Ethics Scientology beliefs and practices Incubus (band) Tom Dumont Hong Kong Monetary Authority Tonality The Smiths Database management system Rock and roll Musician Garth Brooks Computer forensics Play (band) Sound recording Hip hop culture Legal research Indie (music) Multitrack recording Photocopying A Course In Miracles Decca Records Punk rock Music of Louisiana

ideas for events for the drama club we do events like the drama musical children theater workshop skits for halloween for kids what did your drama club do that you thought was a really big success in addition to what you have listed my high school's drama club found great success in going to see live stage productions in philadelphia and new york we are from southern new jersey so those cities were closest holding trips to see broadway shows or any touring hit show is a great way to bring publicity to your drama club and get people interested in joining as an additional point of interest to the existing members of the club we often had speakers before we would see a show to discuss with us the theatrical and technical aspects of putting on such a performance sometimes we were even able to schedule a meeting time to talk with some minor cast members before showtime most theatres are open to that kind of thing for the sake of arts education so it is generally not too terribly difficult to make this kind of thing happen hope that helps  Drama Theatre Broadway theatre Saturday Night Live Jerry Herman Polish theater Hunter College High School Lincoln Center Rodgers and Hammerstein Sally Ann Howes Theater in the United States Barbra Streisand Sketch comedy Soap opera West End theatre Avenue Q Garth Brooks Carnegie Mellon University Wonderful Town Hair (musical) EastEnders Yiddish theatre Peter Allen Lindy Hop Requirements analysis Dream Theater King Crimson Science fiction on television Barry Humphries Spice Girls The Monkees Jacob Pavlovitch Adler George Abbott Irish theatre Porgy and Bess Richard Wagner Sound design Infantilism Broadway (Manhattan) Monty Python One Tree Hill (TV series) Stanislavski System Tony Bennett God Emperor of Dune Sesame Street Chess (musical) Live 8 John Cage Tris Speaker Humphrey Bogart English grammar The Emancipation of Mimi Software engineering Musical theater Theory of conduct Miss Saigon Restoration spectacular Meat Loaf Sheryl Crow Otakon Entr'acte Our Gang Jesus Christ Superstar Ken Hill KISS (band) Harrow School Hall & Oates Rock Follies Television syndication Petula Clark WWOR-TV Sport Marching band Fred Ebb Guthrie Theater Dorama Television in the United States The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Lauren Bacall Abbey Theatre Tony Award Grand Forks, North Dakota Toastmasters International BBC television drama Musical works of Mozart Grunge music Goodness and value theory Jon Secada Styx (band) Theatre technique CPU cache The Ashlee Simpson Show Film Death rock Jennifer Lopez Tony Kushner Kylie Minogue Edward Pawley Radio drama Fame Academy

casio privia vs yamaha dgx digital piano i'm looking for a nice digital piano for my apt natuarally i would like it to sound and feel as close to a real piano as possible i want it to have weighted keys which the dgx series says are semi weighted until you get up to the model i'm wondering if any of you had an opinion on either series of these keyboards i'm looking at the or model of the dgx or the or model of the privia depending on the deals i can find if anyone who knows about this stuff could rank those or eleborate on any it d be greatly appreciated please don't just say yamaha because you hear they are better if you have an opinion please state a reason why you like a certian brand thanks in advance i appreciate the quality of the yamaha voicings and their sequencing is vastly superior but if you are using the instrument primarily as a piano the privia has a better action and the stereo piano sound is quite good that being said the other factor is price i picked up a privia for under five hundred dollars to put in my classroom there was already an old beat up yamaha cp or something like that sitting there but it was well past it's prime painted over and i was tired of making the minor repairs to keep it going i liked the privia so much that i bought another one for the living room i like having the headphone option so that if i have to try something out while someone is watching a show in there i don't have to wait until it's over or ruin it for them i like the keys and i like the stereo piano sound i hate the pedal the first thing i did was replace the foot pedal that's the other thing about casio the nice korg foot pedals don't work you have to get it re wired or buy the off brand pedal with the reverse wiring yamaha is becoming a lot like intel they deliberately cripple their models to create value you can have a pretty nice keyboard for the same price as a casio but you have to put up with organ style keys with a three level controller casio has a much more primitive accompaniment feature something you may not care about but when it comes to the mechanics they shine this is a case where i would go for price by the way i got mine from one of the warehouse stores that require membership and begin with s normally i would recommend that you patronize a music store but i know what the markup is on pianos and that isn't going to change anytime soon get the thing on sale if you can there should be some nice back to school sales coming up if they aren't already going on it isn't going to make any difference it comes in a box you get the keyboard a stand that takes forever to put together i have the keyboard at school on an x frame and if you are going to move yours around i would recommend you do the same a pedal that you are going to want to throw away as soon as you unwrap it a boom stand and mike and the inevitable apocryphal instruction manual buy a damper pedal on the way home there is a plug for a faux una corda diminuendo as well but you might actually get away with using the cheap pedal for that unless it is an issue with you that's another area where the yamaha gives you more choices for the left foot i have a psr that i've used for years i don't think you'll be pleased with the mike either but i just threw a shure d on there to play with the headphones don't come with the package so you will want to get a set with a phono plug and a long cord plugs in from the left side nice that it doesn't plug in from the back or front and interfere with your playing but you do need enough cord to reach you should be able to get the for under especially since the new models are already out or will be out soon in your area i still consider casio the next best thing but often the next best thing is the best for my needs  Synthesizer Electronic organ Musical Instrument Digital Interface Tony Banks (musician) Microphone Player piano Effects pedal Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Harp Loudspeaker Time Out

does this piss you off i really hate how all of the celebrities out there aren't very talented most of them are disney stars with mediocre talent look at the stars of high school musical for example ashley tisdale and vanessa hudgens can't sing that well there are a lot of other people out there who are way more talented than they are it is just very frustrating how a lot of famous people aren't even talented like paris hilton and nicole richie they have no talent i know a lot of people who are far more talented than all of these young hollywood stars i don't want to sound conceited but i am talented and i don't know if i will ever make it because it seems like the only way to be famous is to either be on disney or be party girl well entertainment and talent seem to be totally two different things when thinking about the well entertainment business being famous is based on your looks and the stupid stuff you do being talented and a good actor actress is on the movie rolls you do and such you probably won't be as famous as those girls because really they're just there for there couple minutes of fame so we can laugh and watch them screw up their lives or single catchy jingle tunes but you will be respected in the industry if you picked good movie rolls that show off your talent acting singing abilities i don't know if that answers your question i seem to be rambling a lot today d but nah it doesn't piss me off self worth and self respect is waaaaaay better then people laughing and watching you because you can't eat sing like a yr old and decide to show your crotch in public get what i mean  Paris Hilton Nicole Kidman Celebrity Game show The Ashlee Simpson Show Ashlee Simpson Hilary Duff Theory of conduct Musical film Actor The Isley Brothers Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen Friends Humphrey Bogart Judy Garland Hollywood, Los Angeles, California Liam Gallagher Shaggy dog story ABBA Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jennifer Lopez Lucille Ball Quarashi Country music The Jackson 5 Buddy Guy Whose Line Is It Anyway?

snare drum only i'm not rich but i have done music before with this in mind what is the best thing to do with about i would like to start off buying pearl chad smith snare to start and practice hand control i have a practice pad already i would have to save a few years to get a full kit i think it's incredible that you want to master hand control and snare technique before stepping up to a full kit a great drummer can do more amazing things with a three piece kit than a mediocre drummer can with a massive set kudos to you you should probably ask a professional drummer but i applaud you for wanting a quality snare instead of buying a huge amount of crap for the same price i can tell that you are going to turn into one incredible drummer do you have a teacher that will make you even better practice those rudiments i wish more aspiring drummers were like you good luck p s i disagree with tr learning good snare technique is useful and beneficial in any style and it will not harm you or hold you back when you are ready to step up to a full kit i asked my husband who has been a band director for yrs it is always harder to learn the more intricate muscle movements in anything you do oh and don't forget your metronome  Bass drum Mike Portnoy Snare drum Red Hot Chili Peppers Drum Danny Carey Marching band Drum machine Marching percussion Trapping Craps Percussion instrument Ringo Starr Big band Lightsaber combat Pearl Jam Rush (band) Blonde on Blonde John Bonham GunZ The Duel Tenshinhan DrumMania Drummer Martial art Phil Collins Music Current teachings of Prem Rawat The Clash Theory of conduct Shaman King Duran Duran Piccolo Junior Saga Good Charlotte Bouncy techno Judas Priest Drum and bass Highway 61 Revisited Neil Peart YuYu Hakusho Nirvana (band) Shit Metallica KISS (band) House music Milton H.

are there any copyright issues concerning cover songs performed in places like coffee bars street corners and places like that where you only get tips or maybe a small kickback from the owner of the store technically the owner of the store is supposed to pay a licensing fee and send in records of what songs are being performed if as a performer you use sheet music at all to perform the songs you are supposed to follow the guidelines about not playing off of illegitimate copies and so forth most often a member of ascap bmi or more likely a member of the musician's union makes the complaint it is rarely the artist themselves a composer lyric writer and distributor especially the distributor are supposed to get a royalty if the song is performed in public this goes for everything from happy birthday to you're a grand old flag although technically the royalties for g o f go to the boy scouts of america i'm surprised the girls scouts haven't sued the estate for equal representaion by now this ends app years after the death of the writer and composer the most recent song that i remember being passed form commercial money maker to the public domain was this land is your land by woodie guthrie the jib jab folks were being sued by his estate over that little bush kerry spoof they put together rather than defend themselves under the auspices of parody free speech protects performers from being sued if their intention is to lampoon or parody a work of art although they still have to get permission to make a profit on it or distribute it for free without consent from the authors they found a copy of a songbook with this land is you land written after mr guthrie's copyright expired it was an obscure little book but it had the copyright date on it which was good enough for the court in reality the label the manager and the distributor get the lion's share of any money made off of a recording and most performers get caught in the hopeless trap of recording so that they can make money on the road where they work like dogs to get enough money up to record so they can make more money on the road where they etc ad infinitum many major recording stars make less money than coal miners and with the traveling that they have to do and the lifestyle they are living their life expectancy is almost as short  Copyright Public domain Copyleft Fair use Copyright law of the United Kingdom SCO-Linux controversies GNU General Public License Sampling (music) Intellectual property Publishing Software patent debate Woody Guthrie Australian copyright law GNU Free Documentation License "Weird Al" Yankovic American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act The Rutles Copyright infringement First-sale doctrine Happy Birthday to You Recording Industry Association of America Article One of the United States Constitution Digital rights management Unreleased Madonna songs Sony Corp. of America v.

how do i properly play baritone okay so here's the scenario ever since the th grade i've been playing tenor saxophone since then i've been generally happy with that instrument i was never the best but it was fun fast forward years and here i am i'm in the marching band at my high school i've marched tenor sax for years now i've recently had a growing interest in drum corps therefore i switched to baritone i have aspirations of auditioning for a specific corps this fall but back to the question apparently the baritone and tenor sax have different embouchures that's the issue at hand i guess i'm trying to use the tenor sax embouchure on the baritone if that makes any sense the end result is a really tight stuffy sound i'm having trouble relaxing my throat to let more air flow through it's so hard to diagnose this problem myself because this is all i know does anyone have advise on how to loosen up and get a good tone get a teacher why would you think that a saxophone embouchure work for an instrument that doesn't even use a similar mouthpiece or sound generation style would work go get a teacher so you can learn to play it properly i've had many friends who went on to play in some of the best dci groups and i can guarantee you from talking to them that if you don't know how to play the instrument properly you aren't going to make it in any real drum corp because they want the best musicians they can find  Big band Trumpet Marching band Baritone saxophone Embouchure Tenor saxophone Alto horn Clarinet Pet Sounds John Coltrane Marching percussion Vibrato Harmonic series (music) Flute Transposing instrument Oboe Bagpipes Sarrusophone Timpani The Beach Boys Bassoon Musical instrument classification Drum and bugle corps (modern) Mouthpiece Trombone Street-Legal Brass instrument Recorder Western concert flute Music genre Double bass Dave Douglas Phil Collins Brian Jones (musician) Martial art Shine On You Crazy Diamond Music lesson Wardell Gray Bebop Bass saxophone Morphine (band) Uilleann pipes Guitar Diving Brass band The Band Tenor Blues Horn (instrument) Jazz King Crimson Ornette Coleman Prostate cancer Hamiet Bluiett Blonde on Blonde Clef Music of Ireland Elton John Miles Davis Drum Corps International Cello Tin whistle Boyz II Men Shaggy dog story Violin The Beatles Social rule Sly & the Family Stone Adolphe Sax Baritone Turkish music (style) Philosophical skepticism Cornett Buck Fever Pitaten Non-native pronunciations of English Glenn Miller Charlie Parker Music of Brittany The Temptations Ben Webster Therion (band) Lester Young Charles Mingus Fife (musical instrument) Stan Getz Rahsaan Roland Kirk Humphrey Bogart Shot of Love Scientology beliefs and practices Tosca Louis Armstrong 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Theory of conduct Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band Streetlight Manifesto

is a epiphone les paul a good guitar is haven't played that particuler model but epiphone's have impressed me as pretty decent guitars over the last several years at one time they were cheap guitars and played like them the epiphone's i've picked up more recently played well and had a good sound to them the pickups will be one of the biggest differences they won't be the same quality as a les paul the wood will be a lower quality and the specs won't be as right so your not getting a les paul your getting a les paul copy that's at least made by a company owned by gibson i suggest actually playing one they might be a great guitar for joe x down the road and suck for what you want to do  Epiphone Electric guitar Bass guitar Guitar Gibson Les Paul Gibson Les Paul Gibson ES-335 Gibson Firebird Fender Telecaster Gibson SG Acoustic guitar Double bass Gary Rossington James Hetfield The Beatles' influence Harmonica Zakk Wylde Pete Townshend Gibson Explorer Keith Richards Fender Stratocaster Ibanez Sonic Youth Adam Jones Green Day Mandolin Fender Kirk Hammett Gramophone record Multitrack recording Brian May Chet Atkins Eddie Van Halen Humbucker Glay (band) Les Claypool Effects unit Eric Clapton Sound recording Ler LaLonde Mike Bloomfield Dobro Violin Judas Priest Primus (band) Floyd Rose Cheap Trick Pickup (music) Gary Moore Mike Watt Cincinnati Bengals Toyota Land Cruiser Dean Guitars Detroit Red Wings C.F.

an acoustic guitar for beginner i'm looking for a decent acoustic guitar for no more than i'm planning to buy it online preferably at musician's friend buying online should be a last resort with most brands even when you pick a great brand two different axes made the same day right after each other will have vastly different temperments taylor is really the only brand i'd trust buying without actually playing one taylors are expensive the brands that tend to be best for somebody new to a guitar would be ibenez or seagull both make pretty good quality low end guitars often they are competitive with mid price range guitars but are very inexpensive fender and gibson both make beginner packs but your going to get a much better guitar going with ibenez or seagull for the same price range some of the low end yamaha's are also pretty good guitars if you stretch your budget to you get into the mid range guitars and then your talking about gibsons fenders alverezs yamahas worth owning you might even find a used dean or ovation or taylor in that price range that doesn't mean the music shops around your area will have a good one so you want to actually go in and get a feel for the guitar play it see how it feels too you you want to look for any warping of the neck you also want acceptable action action is the distance between the strings and the frets the higher the action the harder it is to play the guitar just as important is you don't want dead spots or buzz on the strings if your never ever going to play down past the th fret you still want a guitar that doesn't buzz or have dead spots to check for buzz and dead spots play each fret down the fretboard they should all sound clear a buzz will make the same sound as if your not holding the string down tight enough that means the action is too low and the string is actually impinged by the fret a deadspot is a note that has a noticiably lower volume than other notes on the fretboard always triple check to make sure you've fretted the string correctly before deciding a fret buzzes or has a dead spot normally strings either buzz up at the st or nd fret or buzz down past the th fret dead spots tend to be in the th to th frets and i've never heard a guitar that had dead spots in consequetive frets so pick a guitar that speaks to you one that fits well with your hands that has the sound that you want that is why it is so hard to buy a guitar online  Violin Electric guitar Double bass Fender Telecaster Tablature Fret Floyd Rose John Myung Acoustic guitar Brian May Sitar Slide guitar Cello Mandolin Twelve string guitar Fingerboard Dobro Berimbau Lap steel guitar Clarinet Van Halen Lute Classical guitar Stevie Ray Vaughan Jimi Hendrix Chapman Stick Mike Watt Audiophile Piano Time Out of Mind Fender Stanley Jordan Poker jargon Bluegrass music Pedal steel guitar Hurdy gurdy Microeconomics Banjo Fender Stratocaster Tapping Strap-on dildo Equine conformation Gibson Les Paul Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Acoustic bass guitar Synthesizer Player piano Guqin Authentic performance Vowel Gramophone record Harmonic series (music) PRS Guitars Bicycle lighting The Beatles' influence The Jam Intonation String instrument Pet Sounds Pat Metheny Mattress MP3 Flute John Frusciante Tony Iommi GunZ The Duel Blonde on Blonde Equal temperament Chess strategy and tactics $ale of the Century Power chord Stradivarius Anthony Jackson Textile manufacturing Zakk Wylde Alexi Laiho Loudspeaker Musical acoustics Alembic Inc Jethro Tull (band) Multitrack recording Epiphone Therion (band) Grateful Dead String theory Saxophone Mutual fund Pop punk Surveillance

i love to sing does anybody know were i can find a producer that can help me right songs and make an album if u can give me a real phone number of a producer that can actually help me with my singig carrier i will give u points i can do that because my dads friend mad yahoo a producer isn't what your looking for producers come in after all the biggest work is done and generally mess it up for you in the name of making it more commercial at your age i looked into some of your questions your voice isn't fully developed so what you do this month will be totally different six months from now your voice will not be the same and you have to worry about blowing your voice out what i'd suggest is taking vocal lessons to maximize your voice now is a good time for you to learn the tips and tricks they will be second nature too you by the time you have really gotten your voice set you did not mention what genre you hope to go into what it takes to make it in various genres is very different you can forget pop at your age because you gotta dance if you can sing that's a plus if not they'll fake it for you at your age it'd get folks arrested if they put you into a sexy video lol instead there is a thriving market along the disney scene for serious music for their movies and tv channel they want younger performers there lay your opportunity you have ambition but do you have the drive to be really good at something that means doing almost nothing but working on the songs pretty much every day for the next couple years that is alot of childhood you will regret losing out on do you want it that bad to give up the birthday parties the swim meets the sleepovers or whatever else folks you age do nowdays you will need dance lessons and singing lessons that's where you'll spend your days and your nights will be going over and practicing material next question even if your willing that doesn't mean your parents will be supportive of your efforts so you have to line your parents up behind you on this they are the ones who have to foot the bill for the lessons who have to buy the gear your going to need if your not ready to devote your life to this goal and you cannot get your parents behind the effort i suggest taking the slow route to fame and fortune work on this as a long term goal there is no instant success if you work at it every day for the next year or two then you might be ready if you work at it steadily but also have a life expect to be ready in to years there is volumes of stuff you have to learn just to go on stage in terms of pop music you have to look like a diva to have any chance of success in other music forms like rock metal country and such you can succeed on voice rather than looks in pop if you don't have the looks your voice can be the greatest anybody has ever heard but your not going anywhere right now you don't even know how your going to look so i'd suggest delving into a genre that isn't going to be so dependent upon your looks i am a composer show me you have dedication and the voice and i'll write up some tunes you can use to hit the disney scene several artists have launched their careers from disney it's the only real market for an artist your age the gear you need is a good quality vocal mic a vocal effects box a break out box and recording software along with access to a computer you'll need broad band internet to move files as well the gear will run you about until you have it you really don't know what you sound like distortions in recording can hide weak spots in your vocals or destroy good vocals karoke machines and boombox mics are worthless when it comes to studio quality vocals don't let age get in your way if you follow my profile there's a link to my betarecords tunes and the singer on the first two tunes was when he recorded those songs but also don't be in too big a hurry to grow up it's mean mean world out there it aint like tv it aint like movies you only get one chance to be a kid enjoy it

does the type of string on a guitar affect its quality i mean i have a steel string guitar but when i listen to people play on guitars with nylon strings it sounds a lot better so i just want to know if there's a difference between the sound quality of steel and nylon string guitars the tension on a nylon string is much lower steel has a great deal more pull per square inch than nylon so it gives a bright ringing tone at least until it gets worn out nylon gives a warm rich tone because the string is allowed to vibrate a little more widely due to it's lower tension there is also a difference in what materials you make the original gut strings were made of horse's intestines and everything from the curing process to the health of the animal could affect it's tone and durability now most strings are made of nylon nylon core with wrapped steel many different kinds of steel steel wrapped steel and every other kind type thickness and treatment that you can imagine the latest trend is to wrap strings in a durable casing so dirt and the elements can't penetrate past the windings even the windings themselves can make a difference originally we had the round wound strings this meant that a very thin round piece of wire was wrapped around a core next there was the flat wound string instead of a round piece of wire the string makers used a flat piece of metal ribbon so that the sound between the strings would sound more even jazz guitarists particularly like this kind of string then there is the half wound string which is that same very thin piece of wire but one side of it has been shaved or flattened so that the string retains most of it's bell like quality while making it quieter to slide up and down the string without that annoying squeak the materials themselves can make a difference as well strings are made from everything from aluminum to platinum including silver gold and everything in between there are as many formulas as there are manufacturers and every season someone comes up with some new innovation while the other companies try to back engineer the process and copy it on top of that musicians do everything from soak their strings in molasseses to polishing them with toothpaste to get that slightly different sound that will hopefully make them unique enough to catch a star for their fifteen minutes or more of fame  Harp Piano Double bass Electric guitar Clarinet Welding Screw Guqin Timpani Bassoon Mattress Cello Undergarment Acoustic guitar Saxophone Terminal ballistics Gramophone record Casting Transformer Lute Strap-on dildo Gas metal arc welding Trombone Wire Solar cell Strings (music) Bullet Textile manufacturing terminology Aluminium Drill bit Billiards Floyd Rose Plastic Knife Fender Telecaster Berimbau String instrument Harmonica Flute Harpsichord Suture Harmonic series (music) Bicycle frame Wood Leather Classical guitar Cartridge (firearms) Gong Equine conformation Diamond Hurdy gurdy Seismic retrofit Knitting Titanium Table saw Amateur telescope making Typewriter Rope Authentic performance Pitch (music) Microphone Barbed wire Repouss__ and chasing Electrical wiring Diving suit Magnet Mute (music) Judas Priest Nylon Internal ballistics Friction Space elevator Sail-plan Synthesizer Bow (music) Slide guitar Clothing Phonograph cylinder Diamond cut Arc welding Brazing Tire Spark plug Movie projector Corrosion Vowel Time Out of Mind Steel guitar Katana Plectrum Loudspeaker Rolling-element bearing

violin help i have been playing the violin for years and after the second year i keep popping my wristes and my shoulder out of socket and when i pratice my chain really starts to hurt i went to a profession store made just for stringed instroments and they gave me a new chin and shoulder rest do you have any tips i am very greatful for any help the right chin rest and shoulder rest do make a world of difference if those haven't fixed the problem then you need to examine your technique do you have a teacher if the answer is no then get one immediately before you cause long term problems and physical damage to yourself if you feel pain while you are playing other than callouses toughening up then you are doing something wrong and you should stop and rest if you do have a teacher then have you discussed these problems with him her it sounds to me like you aren't holding the instrument correctly there should be absolutely no tension whatsoever when you hold and play the instrument correctly i know it's easier said then done if you do have a teacher and they can't seem to find the problem or help you fix it then i recommend finding another teacher or at least take a few lessons from someone else to see if they can help you should take this seriously playing with improper technique for long periods of time can cause permanent damage i know people who have been forced to end lucrative professional careers because they didn't catch things until too late good luck  Violin Tai Chi Chuan Harp Diving Bass guitar Professional wrestling holds Cello Viola Boxing Shaggy dog story Timpani Theory of conduct Fast bowling Social rule Aerial (dance move) Floppy disk Vibrato Debugging Weight training Alexander Technique Goodness and value theory Carpal tunnel syndrome Saxophone Spanking Orchestra Golf Fecal incontinence Music lesson Aikido Embouchure Abortion debate Hurdy gurdy 1957 World Series Halting problem Billiards Archery Bow (music) Guqin Equine conformation Trumpet Professional wrestling attacks Glossary of climbing terms Frank Zappa Authentic performance Current teachings of Prem Rawat Clarinet Romantic music Scientology beliefs and practices Menstrual cup Infantilism Volleyball Bow (weapon) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Repetitive strain injury Sergei Prokofiev Music Earring String instrument Brian Close Teacher Philosophical skepticism Theodicy Breastfeeding Procrastination Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Pet Sounds Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Viol Bubble Bobble Pitch (music) John Cage Professional wrestling throws Frogman Asperger syndrome Bondage (BDSM) Prostate cancer Charles Ives Education in the United States Ethics Operation Market Garden Contredanse Guitar Piccolo Junior Saga GunZ The Duel Photography The nature of God in Western theology Aesthetic Realism Sonata (music) Jon Secada Socrates Piano Strike (attack) The Yardbirds Dualism (philosophy of mind) Stuttering A Course In Miracles Kodocha Ice hockey

do you think i'll get my voice back anytime soon i'm i used to practice my singing an hour every day i take lessons and i could sing for hours without my vocie feeling tired i was finally making real progress around the end of june my allergies started to kick in my throat was sore for two weeks it went away but for the past month my allergies weaken my voice most days i can only sing for minutes at a time before my voice feels strained my vocie was completley back for about days out of the past month my severe allergies are to dust and dust mites our house carpeting is over years old i have to vacuum use an air purifier take medicince and a nasal everyday spray just so my voice won't hurt while i talk we may get the carpet replaced with laminate flooring but i don't know if there was any permanent damage done to my voice anybody else experince something similar i often have stuffy nose and post nasal drip when thick mucus runs down the back of the throat and stills on the vocal cords most likely it could be one of two things many you're voice is still weak and will recover in a couple of weeks to its full strength don't try to do very much with it and certainly don't yell or scream or anything fun but damaging nothing that you described will really damage your voice permanently but it can slow the recovery the second thing may be a little more lasting since you are years old it's quite possible that your voice is changing of course boys go through this at and its very noticeable but girls also go through a stage where their voices change too what it normally means for the girl is that there will be some amount of time maybe a month or two maybe a year or two where your voice will feel weak and you'll loose a lot of your range normally you might be able to sing the high notes and the low notes but not the middle notes very well if this is the case don't worry every famous singer everybody has had to go through this so don't freak out if it takes a year or so to get it all back when it does it will be better than ever  Hay fever Common cold Allergy Group A streptococcal infection Urinary incontinence The Chemical Brothers Chronic fatigue syndrome Social rule Shaggy dog story Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Jon Secada Stuttering Rod Stewart Wheel of Fortune Guilty Gear Liam Gallagher The Inside Human voice Equine conformation The Emancipation of Mimi Mattress Saturday Night Live The Ashlee Simpson Show Stomach cancer House dust mite Highway 61 Revisited Nasal congestion Blood on the Tracks Stop consonant Little Britain Time Out of Mind Episodes of Lost (Season 1) A-ha Slow Train Coming Cocaine Breastfeeding Alveolar nasal Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Weight training Initiation (phonetics) Piccolo Junior Saga Tag Dialysis Mucus Ebola Brewery Radiation therapy Influenza Kodocha Please Please Me Coeliac disease Paget's disease of bone Mount Pinatubo Psoriasis The Marshall Mathers LP Puberty Carburetor Childbirth Jam (TV series) I Want to Hold Your Hand Jet engine Cliff Richard Vowel Avenue Q The Young Ones (TV series) Blood (computer game) Singer RuneScape Nasal consonant The Jazz Singer Severe weather terminology (United States) First aid Journey (band) Fantastic Four Asthma Hall & Oates Sesotho language English grammar Pittsburgh Steelers Poker jargon Overkill (band) Throat singing Traumatic brain injury TLC Authentic performance Hard disk Hangul Wing Chun Pitaten The Amazing Race Joan Sutherland The Basement Tapes Bon Jovi Carbon dioxide Billboard Hot 100
