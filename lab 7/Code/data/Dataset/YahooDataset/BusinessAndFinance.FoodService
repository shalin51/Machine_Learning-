is it good to be a chef wht are the oppourtunities from my experience it is good to be a chef but understand that the term chef is used loosely mostly by those who have not been professionally trained or have not worked in the industry most people start out at the bottom as a cook and work their way up as they learn it is hard work but also very enjoyable being a chef has lots of opportunities you can work anywhere in the world once you achieve the position of chef the pay and benefits are usually very good also understand that it is a physically and mentally demanding job you will work nights and weekends and holidays when your friends and family are off it is not only about food and cooking skills but it also requires good people skills as you train and work with others on your team good luck  Chef Parachuting Iron Chef Unemployment Iron Chef America RuneScape skills Military of Switzerland Labour economics Education in the People's Republic of China Mental retardation Star Wars: Galaxies Tai Chi Chuan Scientology beliefs and practices Tourism Apprenticeship Economic inequality James Beard Celebrity chef Chef Boyardee RuneScape quests Paragliding Walt Disney World College Program Labor theory of value Swedish Chef Alexander Technique Baseball Education Pitaten RuneScape Air traffic controller Julia Child Education in Romania Mountaineering Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Fighting Foodons Stove Piccolo Junior Saga Mixed martial arts Hell's Kitchen (television) Minimum wage Restaurant National Football League French cuisine Tales of Symphonia Division of labour Marginalism Gliding Cooperative education Peter Cook Martial art Civil Air Patrol Kitchen Sam Cooke Industrial engineering Homemaker Happiness Charles William Eliot British cuisine Kung fu Thomas Keller Dog agility Affirmative action Blackjack Sweatshop Scouting Electrical engineering Alton Brown Boy Scouts of America Teacher Procrastination Skilled worker Engineering Kender Urinary incontinence Aikido Lindy Hop BDSM Free trade Minor league baseball Nurse Army Cadet Force Education in Germany Labor-power Mario Batali T___t Ra (board game) Externality Conscription George Costanza The Star Wars Holiday Special Norway national football team In-N-Out Burger Dog training Recipe Reiki Funny Farm (comic) Guild Wars Domination & submission (BDSM) Sport Exploitation

my place of employment is going down the hill help i started working in a fine dining restaurant as a server when i first started they wouldn't allow anyone to work there that has not been a server before plus you had to take a pretest on drinks and serving etiquette and if you didn't pass it you would not be hired they were extremely professional in their jobs and it made very very good money i would walk out with a night suddenly drama happened and things started to fall apart we have a new mngmt crew now and they hire anyone that wants the job our new staff has crap for common sense and lack work ethic there are no tests no more weekly serving classes all the servers that had been there before got fed up and quit i am the only one left with a fresh new staff that can't tell up from down our restaurant has turned into a joke i'm lucky to get in a night now i've tried to talk to the managers but they're just as bad and i'm not much for putting my foot down when i should help i can't get more tables since the staff was performing so horribly the managers decided to just put more people on every shift and hire more people i tried to suggest keeping a low staff and training them severely but they didn't want to do that not much of one to put your foot down well then continue to work there otherwise put your foot down no offense but you are the backbone of the restaurant those who break their back to make the company successful are the least appreciated i'm sure the dishwashers work harder than you and don't get tips so appreciate your tips or go get a different job which is your best option when you're still young and tippable this is meant in the best possible manner you either go with the flow or jump on the next boat in other words sink with the ship or grab a life raft personally you're wasting your time trying to make them see the err in their ways why would a restaurant owner manager take business advice from a lowly server they've already shown the inability to hire competent staff it's a sign of where they place the importance do they value you as these other less competent servers yes you need to fluff your resume  Craps Aerial (dance move) Social rule Customs and etiquette of Japan Shaggy dog story Kitchen Friends Mojave people Knots Landing Tennis Poker jargon Avenue Q Freeters Procrastination Restaurant Volleyball Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Wal-Mart Theory of conduct Tip Futurama (TV series - season 2) Whose Line Is It Anyway?

i'm an inexperienced teenager and i want to apply for a waitressing job but have no idea how to waitress help like it is i started waitressing when i was and no it may not be rocket science but there are some things you can keep in mind that may make your shift go smoother or to impress management i can't tell you how to waitress because each restaurant is different but i can tell you how to make things easier as you are learning the ropes six things to keep you from going crazy balance your time don't put things off if you get an order put it in as soon as you can never be afraid to ask for help that was hard for me because i'm so independant find someone who you feel comfortable asking just keep in mind they are all working too if you get swamped let someone know you need things to ease up your employer will know you are inexperienced and won't hold it against you be good to the kitchen staff if all the waiters waitresses hate you that's no loss but always keep the kitchen on your side they determine whose orders go out quickly and correctly and if you mess up they will be more likely to fix it for you without complications keep an eye on your tips and your money and don't burn bridges remember that how big of a tip you get is completely decided by you a customer can decide if they are going to have and enjoyable experience as soon as they meet you good attitude good tip waitresses make next to nothing on a paycheck so tips are very important just treat customers how you would want to be treated if you were dining if you establish a good relationship in the beginning they may be less likely to be upset if something happens with their meal iif you are calm and happy you will make your customers feel at ease don't get me wrong you will have quite a few douche bags who you will never make happy no matter how hard you try but don't let it get you down and don't give them any extra attention do a few check backs when a table gets their meal but don't be pushy it helps if you walk by the tables often so they can flag you down if they want something don't leave the bill on the table for a long time because if they are ready to leave they won't want to wait for you to notice it's sitting there so after you drop it off glance back to see if they are getting the money together so in that case you know they are ready to leave if they don't start to get the money together than they probably wil sit for awhile also by not wondering to far away if they have a question with the bill you will be close by to answer it always try your best to look your best and i don't have to tell you why take on any extra duties you can so that you can learn as much as you can because the more you know the more money you will make if your restaurant has a bar try to work that section it means alot more money but with it comes alot more action because it is seated faster so try to take it on when you feel comfortable with the slower sections finally i can say that if a seated table who has there meal asks for something extra like steak sauce get it for them first if they are sitting there looking at there food and they can't eat it your tip will suffer if you are doing something else than ask someone to grab it for you on the way out try to determine what someone may want with there order before there food comes like extra napkins or a small plate to share that will make things easier when you are busy goodluck  Shaggy dog story Restaurant Waiter Dog training Friends Rain Man Poker jargon Little Britain Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tip The Apprentice 2 The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Cuisine of Denmark Aerial (dance move) Theory of conduct Betting (poker) The Contender (television series) Kitchen Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Milton H.

i'm at ok state could u tell me can i work at years old and could u show me where i can work at thanks here's a short list of jobs which you can create to generate income learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties birthday celebrations etc seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples a starter calligraphy kit usually runs around and anyone can easily pick up this skill the going rate is usually per hand addressed item become a poser who assists wedding photographers in setting and arranging various individuals in group and single photographic positions posers carry around a sketch book of various sitting and standing poses which consists of onion skin overlays of various wedding pictures bound in albums again contact local wedding photographers and wedding planners accordingly the hourly pay is around per hour and you are often invited to attend all dining activities seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting weed removal plant tree trimming light brush clearance you will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools again do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved a door to door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between to per hour offer policing removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process again a door to door solicitation of neighbors is in order you can charge between to per hour acquire a set of window cleaning tools a bucket liquid window cleaner sponge squeegee handle with an extension and a small step ladder and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services however be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story charge per window panel become a proxy stand in for neighbors to allow delivery of goods and packages to your home apartment acquire the authority to sign any receipt of incoming packages as an accepting neighbor charge per each package handled by you consider becoming a restaurant cafe customer liaison by using your cell phone at restaurants cafes to coordinate with the hostess to keep track of waiting customers whenever there's a very long period of time to activate a waiting list you want to offer the restaurant your services so that customers do not have to stand around for any lengthy period of time and when their name assigned number comes up you can call the upcoming customer's cell phone to tell them that they can return to the restaurant and be served the call back fee is usually around cents on a per head basis for example a couple would be charged while children under would not be charged placement of a plaque which outlines your fee schedule near the hostess station is sufficient to garner attention of prospective customers who will value your services since they can do other activities outside of the restaurant often beyond the range of any inhouse paging system you realize that everyone has a cellphone and why not take advantage of the connectivity to make the diner's experience worthwhile the restaurant will also appreciate the added service you are providing as a customer liaison why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing convalescent assisted living care centers and hospitals it involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves the starting rate is per hour the only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding a posting of your services by a business card or flyer on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers the paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time good

what service restaurants offer flexible schedules i have all this experience from years of working in the restaurant industry but it all goes to waste because i can generally only work part time and nights for college of the places i go to expect me to work full time with or days a week with double shifts or work only lunch hours since the management was inept and only hired dinner staff now i'm just generally getting sick of all this and only want to work part time on my terms what restaurant chains generally allow part time work and flexible schedules i work for chili's and we are pretty good about that considering that most of our staff is in college most managers want you to be worth their while which is probably shifts a week if a restaurant is wanting you to work that much they must be understaffed and you probably don't want to work there anyway as they will put added pressure on you remember you have to be worth the time the job invests in you training managing schedules you getting good at the job only shifts a week etc is expensive  Wal-Mart Call centre Restaurant Education in the People's Republic of China Inflation DisneySpeak Air traffic controller Hamburger In-N-Out Burger Working time Outsourcing Tip Graduate school Keynesian economics The Apprentice 2 International League Battle of Britain Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK) Ltd Walt Disney World College Program Labor theory of value Electronic commerce Eric Bischoff Steak n Shake Social rule National Football League Monday Night Football Paralegal Time Out of Mind Professor Cincinnati chili History of SNL:1980-1985 Denny's Game programming ITV VIA Rail Supply and demand United Kingdom corporation tax Dialysis The Devil Wears Prada Nuclear power Norway national football team Publicly funded medicine Mach kernel Wall Street Life insurance Diseconomies of scale Management information system Daylight saving time Baseball Make money fast Warren Buffett Ra (board game) McDonald's Hash table STS-59 Labor-power Tertiary sector of industry Microeconomics Red Hot Chili Peppers Freeters Simutronics Charles Ponzi WNNX (FM) MV Galaxy Just In Time Alex Ferguson Public house Big Brother UK series 6 TLC Employment in Hong Kong MTV2 Super Chief James J.

i am having trouble finding a job i have good qualifications and go to interviews but come back with nothing what am i doing wrong i think i may have poor social skills for getting an interview i've been told that i interview well so i will let you know the things that i do prior to going to an interview one thing is to try and research the job that you are applying to know a few things about the company and its history try to predict questions before they are asked if you can once you go on a few interviews typically a lot of companies even in different industries ask the same type of questions ex what is one difficult situation that you've been in on a previous job and how did you cope with it or resolve the situation ' the key is to try and relate your answer to how it could resolve an issue that might arise at the company you are applying for if possible thats why it is kind of important to research and imagine what it would be like to work for the company you are applying to the usual things like being aware of your posture hygiene making eye contact with your interviewer s another tip is to have an awesome resume it is worth the investment to go to bestbuy or office depot and buy a cheap dollar resume maker program that will help you format and organize your resume i personally have four or five different resumes that i use to apply for jobs in different areas like clerical manageral professional and so on a lot of those programs even makes suggestions based on if you have experience or no experience in the area in which you are applying for try writing a descent cover letter that goes into detail about your work history and skills that will impress your interviewer try to answer every question that is asked of you on occasion i have even made up a answer or too just so that i have answered the question its not recommended to make up an answer unless you will remember what you said previously if you get a follow up question later on also when answering questions try not to say uhhh uhhh or have too long of a period of silence if i'm asked a question and i do not have an immediate answer after about seconds of silence i make something up especially when asked a situational question which a lot of them are rediculous at times before i got my degree i switched jobs at lot to work with my school schedule but also made sure that it was the same or more pay that the previous job i've also had a lot of experience interviewing people and going through panel interviews were more than one person is interviewing you at once these things seem to help me in getting a job a couple of years ago when applying for a operator job before i graduated college i was one of eight people to get a job out of applicants and these are the things that i use to help me during the interviewing process i hope this helps good luck  Social rule Call centre Quizbowl Plame affair Software engineering Autism Graduate school Expert system Economic inequality Theory of conduct Jeff Gannon Ethics GED Education in the People's Republic of China Scientology beliefs and practices Anderson Cooper Consensus decision-making Goodness and value theory Species Computer A Course In Miracles Life insurance Religion Neuro-linguistic programming Killian documents Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Contract Scientific method Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Economics SCO-Linux controversies Minimum wage Milton H.

what is a good way to get my foot in the door as a cook i have very little experiance as a cook just a few months as a cafeteria cook about years ago but i have recently discovered my love of cooking and i really think i would enjoy a career in cooking the only problem is i dont have any idea how i would go about finding a cooking position with no experiance i understand i need to start at the bottom but im not sure where the bottom is so any advice about good places to work or what i can do to make me more appealing as a cooking candidate would be great the very bottom is at a fast food joint although you won't learn much but it'll get your food in the door and you can work to different jobs from there at least you'll have the experience in the industry however both my mother and stepfather worked in the food industry as chefs cooks for a long time they train newbies all the time just be willing to take near minimum wage and you will have no problem your best bet is to go to a school some community colleges offer degree certificate programs so check them out there are also high end schools and that does matter b c it'll get you in the door much quicker just apply don't go for star restaurants but try some chains or franchises or similarly sized restaurants they'll start you chopping vegetables but then as you prove yourself they'll give you tasks with increasing complexity my mom started as a waitress and she found out they needed help in the kitchen and her boss said okay they ended up training her a lot even though she had the basics my stepdad trains people who don't even speak english and have no cooking experience in the kitchen they prefer the english speakers b c they can interface with management and the rest of the staff better not to mention understand customer requests it'll help if you practice at home too that'll help convince them to hire you when you can talk technique with them and it'll help you progress faster i was never in the food industry my mom and stepdad always talked me out of it however more than once their bosses asked me if i would be interested in doing it also i worked as a cashier at a grocery store through high school and college one day one of my bosses asked me if i'd like to learn to bake i said i have no experience she said we'll train you and i'll give you extra an hour i declined b c i didn't like the hours conflicted with college  In-N-Out Burger RuneScape quests Wal-Mart Kitchen Expert system CPU cache Hamburger Restaurant French cuisine The Apprentice 2 Software engineering Extreme Programming Education in the People's Republic of China Japanese cuisine Game programming The Shining (film) Pizza Spring operating system RISC Hell's Kitchen (television) Walt Disney World College Program McDonald's Social rule Pretty Good Privacy RuneScape skills Barbecue Graduate school Computer The Amazing Race Stove Wall Street Poker jargon GED Shaggy dog story Education in the United States College Kashrut Organic food Current teachings of Prem Rawat Fast food Kodocha French fries Tesco Japanese tea ceremony Parachuting Ben Johnson (athlete) Ice cream Education in Portugal Solar power Cookware and bakeware Ty Cobb Supermarket Redundant array of independent disks 1957 World Series Labor theory of value Plame affair Economic inequality CPU design G-Man (Half-Life) Mach kernel Second language acquisition 2000 Australian Grand Prix Grandview, U.S.A.
