in the process of painting on a canvas need help now i have painted a red woman on a pice of canvas with a black background but it looks a bit boring not dry yet but i would like to add some more coulor without making a mess of it please help it has to be done for next monday any thoughts of what i could do to it the painting might pop if you add a colour that's an opposite to what you've got an opposite to the red would be a pthalo blue or pthalo green however you can't paint it directly on the black or red because it will mix with the underpainted colours and turn dark my guess is you're painting in oils liquin will help them dry a little faster first paint white let it dry then go over with the other colour to get a purer shade good luck on time constraints for drying  Color theory Color Black Snooker Wassily Kandinsky Arsenal F.C.

why aren't artistic minds appreciated more in contemporary society it may because creative minds have gone into other field that pay much better than that of a painter or sculptor they are everywhere in the film world imagine the artists who worked on 'the lion king' or 'ice age' or 'toy story' or the special effects artists who did the backgrounds for films like 'the matrix ' even if their names aren't know to the public their artistic efforts are recognized worldwide sadly this seldom applied to fine art and fine artists  Artist W.

why is lead used in paint on the news this week said that stores had to recall several toys that where painted with lead from china at one time lead was widely used in paint up until the scientist found that it was causing cancer so what is the reason that lead is used in paint is cheaper to make paint with it does it make the paint thiner does it make the paint stronger or brighter lead makes the paint more durable because it stabilizes the color and makes the paint last longer but since lead couses lead poisoning because it is a heavy metal and doesn't get released from the body but accumulates the use of lead paint became unlawful a person has to be careful when they do construction and demolition in houses that were build before because that is when they stopped using the paint  Plastic Lionel Corporation Titanium Paint Strap-on dildo Circuit design Poison Plutonium Lead Aluminium Radium Dog Lead paint Fixed-wing aircraft Guitar Prostate cancer Iron Leather Airsoft Antimony Terminal ballistics Casting Light-emitting diode PlayStation 2 Color Dodge Charger Brush Chromium Upholstery Vitamin C Pennsylvania Railroad Primer (paint) Nuclear power Alcoholism Nuclear reactor Stone Age Violin Breastfeeding Taxicab Milk Bulk vending James Bulger Lead poisoning Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Yellow Omega-3 fatty acid Lung cancer Urinary incontinence Autism Baldness Bicycle brake systems Bong Pebble bed reactor Stomach cancer Hulk (comics) Gun safety Mercury (element) Ives Manufacturing Company Black metal Traditional animation Zero (Mega Man) Technetium Masonry Mattress Traumatic brain injury Vitreous enamel Chinese art Saxophone Ozone depletion Toronto Eaton Centre Shipwreck Gramophone record Ceramics Chinese painting Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Potassium School bus Billboard (advertising) Al-Aqsa Intifada Cancer Abortion Caterpillar D9 Imperial Guard (Warhammer 40,000 army) Little Ice Age Barium Gold standard IPod nano Money Ozone hole Weapon Van Halen Battery (electricity) Table tennis Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Diode Depleted uranium Babe Ruth Commodore 64

what do you look for in a painting when you want to buy it as an investment well being a collector and artist myself after years at doing what i do and admiring other artists i've determined that i buy what i like firstly my general rule of thumb is does the artist have a know trasck record at auction if so thats a good indicator i'm interested is the artist dead if so then it's another good indicator i'll buy more than anything though i ask this does the artist have a really good story and associations with great stories if these all come together i'm buyin  Gross domestic product Security (finance) Art Philatelic investment Mutual fund German car number plates Book collecting Slide rule UK Singles Chart Paintball Poker jargon L.

i have an oil painting that is signed at the bottom ferrante how do i know which ferrante it is there are more than one and i think it may be quite valuable now my husband bought it for me in it appears to be a picture of busy little street in the city with ladies in their long dresses and hats and gentlemen in their long cloaks and there is also a horse and buggy a painting won't become valuable simply because it was purchased years ago the worth depends completely on the artist and you don't know his first name if the painting was purchased from a gallery you could ask that gallery if it's still in business and if it wasn't purchased from a gallery or directly from the artist the chances of it being valuable or even original are not very good otherwise you're going to have to use google or some other search engine to pull up images by artists name ferrante and comparing the work and signatures to see if you can find your ferrante then look up the prices of that artist's work on ebay the bid prices will give you an idea what people are willing to pay for it  Network effect Auction Monopoly (game) Rembrandt Art Inflation Francis Bacon (painter) Gross domestic product __douard Manet Amazon.com The Haunted Mansion David Teniers the Younger Arthur Streeton Philatelic investment Diego Vel__zquez Art forgery Poker jargon Brett Whiteley Slide rule Live 8 Internet fraud De Lorean DMC-12 Online auction business model Ra (board game) Winner's curse Surveillance Digital photography National Gallery, London Baseball Stars Leonardo da Vinci Price discrimination National Gallery of Ireland Caravaggio Solarquest Eug__ne Delacroix Mutual fund Drawing Electronic commerce L.

question for professional artists how do you choose what colors to use i understand warm and cool colors complementary primary secondary and teritiary colors but what is the rule when painting does every color you use need to have the complementry does every color need to be in every tone and value i use oils i know everyone says don't worry about the rules but then when you show it to someone who is a critic they say you need blue in that picture or some other color i don't mind breaking the rules but i would like to under stand them first puppy i can't take out the rules if i wanted because i can't find them i just keep hearing that there is rules it seems to be some big secret as to what they are jackie it is so refreshing to see your question and to know there is a new generation of artists who care about the rules yes indeed there are rules and you will learn them in time with your attitude and you will conquer painting just don't expect it to happen over night if you already understand complimentaries and warm cool colors you only need to learn about values the darkness or lightness of the paint and harmony and then you will know the rules well enough to break them hang in there kid it is well worth the effort  Color theory Social rule Color Wassily Kandinsky Drawing Art Carl Barks Jon Secada Impressionism Paint The Ashlee Simpson Show Care Bears Lighting Jennifer Lopez Humphrey Bogart Ozone depletion Comanche Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Black Grace Cossington Smith Abstraction Theory of conduct Jeopardy!

do you know the forms of stencilings and the materials used can you also add where they are applied on stencils are usually made of either a flexible plastic that you can use over and over again or thick cardboard like paper most office supple stores and art supply stores sell both types stay away from the paper stencils once they get wet they rarely hold their form very long you can use just about any type of artistic materials from paint to ink to water colors to pencils to spray paint when using stencils i've used them with acrylic paint when i've wanted to add perfectly formed lettering to some of my paintings the only thing to consider is if you're going to be using a fluid liquid like ink or water color because the colors might seep under the stencil and 'bleed' onto whatever materials canvas or paper or whatever your using if you're using liquid with the stencils you'll need to press the stencil firmly against the material while you work so that you won't get any unintended 'run' under the stencil any onto your artwork  Surrealist techniques Screen-printing Printmaking Drawing Paint Casting Typewriter Mimeograph machine Traditional animation Painting Printed circuit board Polymethyl methacrylate Piet Mondrian Rubber stamp Art Duplicating machines Plastic Polymer clay Leather Watercolor painting Inkjet printer Pottery Vitreous enamel Fire extinguisher Stucco Ink M.C.

my moms friend was painting and left the bucket of washed paint water in my washroom my moms friend was painting my house wall and left the bucket of full water which was used to wash the paint brush roller now the bucket is full of dirty paint water with the brush in my washroom and its near my room im afriad it might cause health problems so i wanna ask if i should cover it up with a bag or something cause i told my mom to move it out of the washroom but she said her friends going to use it soon so dont touch it and got all mad so yeah my question is should i cover the bucket and the brush loaded with dirty paint water with a bag thx extra details the probem is my mom is weird and doesnt want me to move the brush with the bucket of water in the garage because she said the brush roller needs to be in water and wont let me touch it i know the question is weird and hard to answer but please no bad comments like what kind of question is this thanks alot before you get all excited and cause undue and needless friction between yourself and your mom you might want to find out what kind of paint your mom's friend is using first if it's latex paint and i'm pretty sure it is or he wouldn't have left it in a bucket of water you have nothing to worry about latex paint acrylic water based paint is completely harmless to you your lungs or the environment even if it's an oil based paint it's not very likely that it will cause you any harm because it's simply a diluted mixture of harmless residue left over from the paint and the fact that it's emerged in water takes away the possibility of any harmful fumes there is not enought paint on a diluted washed out roller sitting in a bucket of water to cause anyone any harm  Paint Bong RuneScape quests Toilet Menstrual cup Brush Thermal power station Washroom Jumpstart 3rd Grade Glossary of climbing terms Blood on the Tracks Dairy Tag Avenue Q The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Hey Arnold!

how much does a professional painter get paid per hour just wondering if you're asking about house painters i can tell you that most of them from my experiences here in california texas washington maine etc don't usually bid jobs by the hour or charge by the hour the price they charge is based on a bid for the whole job the only way you can calculate a per hour rate would be by how quickly and hopefully how well you did the bid job less the cost of materials it's pretty much the same with all contractors they bid a job of how long they think the job will take how much they think the building materials will cost and they factor in any hired labor costs they will have to pay for helpers it you're asking about artists then very few of them unless it's a commissioned work like a public mural could ever ask for or expect to receive per hour pay for a painting art work is only of real value to the seller and buyer so there is no way you could ever gage the art on a per hour basis example if i sell a painting for and it took me four hours to paint does that mean i charge an hour what if i can only get for the painting it's still the same painting so how do i gage it's per hour value you really can't what if i sell it for and it's value goes up to after i've sold it i didn't get a an hour for painting it by the way i've painted houses and i paint on canvas so i've had plenty of experience in both areas  Wal-Mart Microeconomics Economics Option Real estate broker Painting Mortgage Supply and demand Inflation Unemployment Surplus value Christo and Jeanne-Claude Ford Motor Company Monopoly ITunes Music Store Stanton Macdonald-Wright Auction Insurance Diego Vel__zquez Housing cooperative Mutual fund Capitalism Construction Arbitrage Price discrimination Economic inequality Hyperinflation Islamic banking Art forgery Value added tax Karl Rove Minimum wage Leonardo da Vinci Art Oil-for-Food Programme Wassily Kandinsky Frans Hals New Deal Efficiency wages Raytheon Oxford English Dictionary Education in the People's Republic of China Economic rent Day trading Rembrandt Illegal drug trade Rational pricing Rufus Porter The Apprentice 2 Surplus labour Futures contract Pablo Picasso Vincent van Gogh Insider trading Artemisia Gentileschi Gross domestic product Fuel injection Mural Internet fraud Teresa Heinz Kerry Mid-levels Taxation in the United States Life insurance Willem de Kooning Wayne Corporation Gustave Courbet Art in Ancient Greece Electronic Arts Computer Piet Mondrian Gold standard Martin Sharp Raphael FairTax Hillary Rodham Clinton Caravaggio Tintoretto Final Fantasy XI Stock Chinese painting Academic art Andrea Mantegna Production, costs, and pricing Dividend Francis Bacon (painter) Carl Barks Florida Central Voter File Georges-Pierre Seurat Andy Warhol Pierre-Auguste Renoir Economy of Russia Outsourcing William Blake Art theft James T.

are you a painter who works from a planned idea or do you work intuitively allowing the painting to emerge and develope as you are working on it making discoveries along the way have you tried both if so which works best for you and why by planned idea i mean by using an already drawn out plan as in a drawing or having a system by which you already have down and work by planned idea i also mean from a very conceptual approach here is what has worked for me for years now because i would quickly get bored doing paintings in the same style over and over again and because i hate waiting for paint to dry on specific paintings i usually start work on at least two and most often three paintings at the same time the first painting will be one that i have already conceived in my head and pretty much know before hand what it will look like this is usually a figurative realistic painting the up side to doing a painting that i already know what it will look like is that i am almost always pleased with the finished work the down side to such paintings are that there aren't any fun or inspired 'surprises' in doing these the second painting and often the third too will be something i've been wanting to try to play around with and only have a vague idea of what i will be doing with it these works are always fun to do because i like the sudden surprises they sometimes offer and i allow for sudden changes of direction or content tone the down side to the vague idea paintings is that every once in a while the painting ends up looking like crap and ends up getting painted over the third painting will be one that comes purely from the sub conscience meaning i simply start working on it without any idea what it's going to be what it's going to look like i call the ones i paint in this style my 'sub symbolism' paintings because they really are works that come from somewhere just below the surface that come from the sub conscience funny thing is quite often i'm more amazed by and end up liking more these paintings than the ones that have been pre planned from the beginning  Drawing Craps Mathematics Philosophy of language Jacques-Louis David Ontological argument Milton H.

a sunday afternoon on the island of la grande jatte help i dont see what the big deal is with the childs face people tell me they see her face then dont i see her face it doesnt go away am i suppsed to look closer this painting georges seurat's most famous work belonging to the post impressionist period is considered to be one of the most remarkable paintings of the th c let me try to explain why and how one should look at it before he painted this scene in oils seurat made many sketches of it focussing on issues of color light and form he and his colleagues of that time were involved in a serious study of color and optical theory what they learnt came together for the first time in this painting where seurat employed a style of painting now called pointillism instead of applying paint with standard brush strokes he applied miniature dots of different colors which would form a single brilliant hue in the viewer's eye the right way to look at this painting is to step well back from it to a point when your eyes will optically mix these dots of color the colors then begin to shimmer with the figures in the picture seen just as the artist planned either as sparkling clear shapes or in semi shadow i hope this helps you to see the picture in a different light  Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte Pointillism Drawing Impressionism Piet Mondrian Autostereogram Vincent van Gogh Academic art Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Cubism Diamond cut Wassily Kandinsky Looney Tunes: Back In Action Color Color blindness Grace Cossington Smith Rembrandt El Lissitzky Photography Andrea Mantegna Titian Glass French art of the 19th century Computer animation Portrait miniature Painting Perspective (graphical) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Art Bridget Riley Hangul Stereoscopy Frans Hals Serialism United States dollar National Gallery, London Headlight Drew Struzan Pierre-Auguste Renoir Watercolor painting Diamond Surrealist techniques Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Alhazen Sundial Plame affair Brush Ray tracing NTSC CIE 1931 color space Mouse (computing) Software engineering Popeye Franz Boas Abstraction Tempera Light-emitting diode Film Stanton Macdonald-Wright Western art history Hubble Space Telescope Wood carving Physics __douard Manet Traditional animation Quantum dot White Billboard (advertising) Art in Ancient Greece Bill Peet Eye Topiary Comics M.C.

difference between professional 'tube' acrylic paint and cheaper 'bottle' acrylics paints apple barrel i see small tubes of 'professional' acrylic paint at michaels for to and then i see the same color in a bottle labled 'craft smart' or 'apple barrel' for around cents i am a beginning acrylic painter using pretreated stretched canvas what is the reason these paints are so expensive the colors seem identical held side by side to my eye is it more satisfying or perhaps more convenient is it worth purchasing if i am not painting as a means of income but instead as a means of expression i e does expensive paints just mean a higher price tag for completed painting thank you for any insight you may provide when you're learning to paint the smart thing is to use the cheaper paints you can buy why waste high quality paint on what will probably not be a masterpiece as to going to michael s my question is why try visiting a local real art supply store not only will they have a much better selection on artists' materials they will also sell liquitex basics basics is a cheaper brand of fairly good quality acrylic paint that comes in oz jars here's the thing about acrylic paints in tubes vs jars what if you squeeze out too much paint from a tube more than you can or will use at the time you can't exactly put it back in the tube can you so basically whatever you don't use instantly will be wasted because acrylics dry so quickly i haven't used tubes of paint for years simply for this reason also as you become a little more involved with painting you will probably want to start mixing and making your own colors after you blend the exact color you want you will learn to store it in an air tight jar these jars you can buy at most art supply stores and they are cheep they come in or oz sizes about the quality of paints cheaper paints will fade over time tend to be streakish and runny because they are not as full bodied as better quality paints you usually have to go over the same area more than once better quality paints will have a 'lightfastness' rating on the jar or tube that lets you know that they will endure a lifetime the best full bodied acrylic polymer paints on the market when you've reached the point where you think you want your art to last a lifetime are golden and m graham liquitex would be my third choice  Plastic Bong Paint Digital photography Gross domestic product Mattress Solar cell Laserdisc Art CPU design Inflation Economics Carburetor Solar power Hamster Binoculars Circuit design Strap-on dildo Alcoholic beverage Painting Acrylic paint CPU cache Epoxy Floppy disk Airsoft M16 (rifle) Cider Mutual fund Internal ballistics Atari ST Wine Brewery Publicly funded medicine Gramophone record Bicycle lighting Computer RuneScape economy Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Wassily Kandinsky Slide rule Bulk vending Incandescent light bulb Illegal drug trade Mac OS X ITunes Impressionism Georges-Pierre Seurat Apple Computer Supply and demand Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Modem Casting Cable television Eyepiece Central processing unit Drawing Strategic management RISC ITunes Music Store Tax Commodore 64 Photography Polymethyl methacrylate Gasoline Rum Light-emitting diode Inkjet printer Lionel Corporation Gas metal arc welding Audiophile Bicycle frame Hydrogen economy Pastel United States dollar Money Scuba set Fluorescent lamp Tea Milk Tesco Dairy Filling station Tire Cannabis cultivation Single malt Scotch Cigar Transformer Commodity Oscilloscope Biodiesel Tag

what color pallete you can use to paint a tree on a landscape i usually have a hard time painting trees or shrubs in a landscape it always turned out to be very bright green or green but does not show a realistic effect of trees or shrubs i want to paint it in a realistic or even impressionistic style i would like to know the pallete of colors i can use like yellow and black will make a green green plus blue plus black will show a color of a pine tree any answer will be greatly appreciated thanks you are not getting a realistic effect because you think all that is necessary is to find the right green color is secondary to value in realism you need to establish a light source for your trees the colors nearest the light source will be light and warm the shadows will be dark and cool bluer there is also the form and texture of the trees to think about and trees are never just green you need to work some warm colors in reds and purples in the shadows yellows and oranges in the sunlit areas  Color theory Wassily Kandinsky Color Light-emitting diode Wood Piet Mondrian Grace Cossington Smith Yellow Collectibles in Bionicle Rendering (computer graphics) Christmas tree Georges-Pierre Seurat Lighting Albedo Gamut Chaos Emerald Paint Impressionism Diamond Pysanka Lightsaber Garnet Dragon Booster Albert Namatjira Drawing BNSF Railway Common bean Beret James McNeill Whistler Crayola Academic art Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Huangshan Mountains Items in the Metroid series Anaglyph image Discus (fish) Primary color Diamond enhancement Comanche Green Sunglasses Synaesthesia Color blindness Chromium Ammolite Netsuke Link (Legend of Zelda) Fluorescent lamp Political colour Power Rangers Color space Extraterrestrial skies CMYK color model Black body Philosophy of perception Coast Douglas-fir Characters in Bionicle Diamond simulant Blue Photography Koi Chinese art Rainbow Wave Race: Blue Storm Bryce Eye color Direct realism Venonat Computer animation R-Type Tag Logo Yoshi Mario Superstar Baseball Pigment The Legend of Zelda series enemies The Warriors Uranium Problem of universals CIE 1931 color space RGB color model Japanese art Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Colours, standards and guidons Rainbow flag Microsoft Paint Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Rose Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Gatorade Red Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch Monofloral honey Pansy Turquoise Rainbow Brite Kryptonite Pok__mon Colosseum Shadow the Hedgehog

mixing paint colors what color do you get when you mix gold with green it depends and differs slightly if you are using acrylic paints or oil colors but all in all this is especially the case in oils because gold as well as silver and bronze does not usually mix well with most earthy pigments the result will be the almost total loss of luster and shine coming from the gold and the mixture turning into a murky kind of brown if you must go for this use the lightest green possible and the brightest gold possible and of course use acrylics the reason behind this phenomena is that the pigments in both colors are not really compatible since the golds are usually made out of fully synthetic materials while the greens are more natural this incompatibility leads to a disruption of light absorption in the final mixed color making it murky and uneven  Paint Color Pigment Color theory Ultramarine CMYK color model Acrylic paint Plastic Primary color Eye color Petroleum Material properties of diamond Gesso Garnet Pastel Diamond cut Silver Diamond simulant Paper marbling Georges-Pierre Seurat Bong Blue Tempera Turquoise Alkane Stucco Human skin color Watercolor painting Polymethyl methacrylate Diamond Fast bowling E85 Explosive material Iris (anatomy) Hair color Diamond enhancement Cat coat genetics Light-emitting diode Sun Textile manufacturing terminology Tofu Pointillism Melanin Gasoline Food coloring United States dollar Drawing Color vision Yu-Gi-Oh!

what's a good asking price for abstract paintings on e bay bidding starting at u s you ask a good question unfortunately there is no easy answer i'll make my most thoughtful attempt first you must make it a point as any commercial artist must do to set a value for your artwork some artists come up with an hourly amount which they feel reflects their level of expertise so if you are professionally trained you might charge hour while others devise a rate schedule based upon the size of the work but realistically there are usually other often important factors to consider when pricing your work namely how much were your artists materials supplies is there a minimum bottom amount you charge for all of your artwork what are similar pieces selling for on ebay make sure that you're not comparing piece you lucked up and created vs a similar looking piece that a master artists spent years honing his talent to create try to be fair and reasonable at all costs because unless you're an established artist full time paying the bills and feeding your kids with your skills you will have to make some sacrifices to get your art seen most importantly be sure not to let money be your sole driving factor be sensitive to the market too remember you can skin a sheep once but you can shear it for a lifetime  Minimum wage Microeconomics Inflation Capitalism Labor theory of value Insurance Martial art Art Economy of Russia Law of value Labour economics Prices of production Economic inequality Welding Tax Scientology beliefs and practices Deflation (economics) Topps Gross domestic product Kitsch Mutual fund Free trade Monetary policy Digital photography Unemployment Publicly funded medicine Education in Portugal Surplus value Amway Casting Ozone depletion Common Agricultural Policy Labor-power MMORPG Magic: The Gathering Bond Education in the United States Monopoly Solar cell Gold standard Airsoft Economics The Apprentice 2 Drawing Copyleft Value added tax Loudspeaker Progressive tax Explosive material Bicycle lighting Monopoly (game) Principal-agent problem Airline Ozone hole Model (economics) Leica Mortgage Live 8 Sega Saturn Arbitrage Supply-side economics Expert system Monopsony Health insurance Bretton Woods system Productive and unproductive labour Textile manufacturing Baseball Yield curve Final Fantasy XI Welfare economics Day trading Public good Money supply Islamic banking Neopets Wal-Mart Hyperinflation Opportunity cost Knife Game show ELO rating system Corporation RISC Tariff Handloading Poker jargon Canadian and American economies compared Photography Capital accumulation Laptop Fusion power Technical analysis Graduate school

if you buy a painting is it ok to take a picture of it and make it into a note card to send to friends or do you need to get the artist's permission you will want to ask the person you bought it from i mean like if its a very old painting then no one actually owns it but if its a new painting then someone probaly has it copyrighted and so unless you bought the rights to it then i'm pretty sure you can't but then again i'm not sure about private use but in my option and i'm not telling you to do this if your not making a profit and your just sending it to a few friends then they won't know and they probaly won't care  United States Postal Service MAME Neopets File sharing L.

an artist called ritter my parents have given me an old oil painting on wood that they had in their attic it is of a young serving girl in wooden clogs holding a jug and looks very old similar to a th century dutch artist the signature looks like ritter or ritte but i cannot find anyone by that name has anyone heard of this name hi i've been looking and i think this is bigger than both of us ha i've found caspar ritter http www askart com askart artist aspx artist eduard ritter http www askart com askart artist aspx artist louis ritter http www artres com c htm csearchz aspx o total fp e sijmypw p x sid jmgejntbam gc pic sube untwa h ja wilhelm georges ritter laszlo ritter just for starters and at least more in reference books but nothing with ritte and we are still assuming it is in fact ritter rather than something else so what i would suggest if none of these knocks you off your chair is to take some good photos of it one of the signature the reverse etc and contact one of the major auction houses sotheby's christies bonham's etc or a fine arts appraiser from one of the reputable organizations appraisers association of america etc and ask for advice the fact that it is on panel would lead one to believe it may be of some value i would love to help you more but as this is lacking a first name i could not presume to guess which of these artists it could possibly be darn wish that i could i wish you so much good luck  Auction World Wide Web Baseball L.

need tips on painting a mural i'm going to have a mural painted in my room but the landlord said that it must be done with colors that can easily be painted over when we move out the mural would be of the hollywood hills can light brown paint over grassy green and skyblue hi see if you can get some scenery canvas from dharma trading this comes in widths of inches and a bolt of fabric is usually yards so you could make a piece of canvas the size of your wall and paint on that then when you move you could take it with you or it would be very easy to remove from the wall if someone wanted you should probably first use a few coats of gesso on the canvas before adding the actual artwork if you do choose this approach hope this helps and gives you some options you might like  Casting Gesso Canvas Wood Traditional animation Color theory Textile manufacturing terminology Kirby: Canvas Curse Paint Fan (implement) The Last Supper (Leonardo) Graffiti Seismic retrofit Wassily Kandinsky Textile manufacturing Painting Mural Plastic Drawing John Cage Alexander Calder 2D computer graphics Georges-Pierre Seurat Tent Wood carving Grace Cossington Smith Floppy disk Lionel Corporation Volleyball Dinghy Jackson Pollock Sundial Shroud of Turin Piet Mondrian Drill bit Raphael Topps Glass Prime Minister of Australia Jos__ Clemente Orozco Fenway Park Pierre-Auguste Renoir Marc Chagall Stucco Art Camouflage Panel painting Potato Table saw House System at the California Institute of Technology Bonampak Cubism Arcade cabinet Solar cell Frans Hals Stanton Macdonald-Wright Drew Struzan Light-emitting diode Blenheim Palace Tintoretto Tire Hamster Porsche 993 Tux Paint Vitreous enamel Christo and Jeanne-Claude Carpet Billiards Metalworking Cleveland Browns Stairway Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres Fancy rat Anchor Chu shogi Upholstery Mattress Dundas Square Wilton House The Birth of Venus (Botticelli) Cross-stitch Microsoft Paint Video game console Bong School bus Erotic art in Pompeii Cascading Style Sheets Wallpaper Hollywood, Los Angeles, California Wool Surrealist techniques Screw Frank Stella Fischer Random Chess Tibetan people Guernica (painting) Deck (ship) Billboard (advertising) Printmaking Korean painting

will acrylic paint stick to my t shirt i dont think its cotton its a stretchy material but theres no tag it fits loosely on my body i have to make a goofy t shirt and i dont have time to buy t shirt paint o acrylic works great on cotton or non stretchy fabrics the thing with that stretchy fabric is that after the paint dries and the fabric stretches the design will break where the stretch is occurring i hope you get what i m saying i don't know if i explained it correctly but that's why it will work on cotton because there's almost no stretch involved so the paint stays also if the shirt is going to be washed is very likely that some parts will come off or crack i know you said you don't have time but your best bet is the fabric paint unless the t shirt is going to be worn just the one time and not be too stretched i hope this helps you out take care  Knitting Textile manufacturing terminology Textile manufacturing Upholstery Plastic Mattress Casting Fecal incontinence Shirt Menstrual cup Acrylic paint Paint Ironing Manicure Diaper Kilt Weaving Linen Leather Clothing Poker jargon Tallit Denim Rope Yarn Brassiere Gesso Cloth Kimono Paper marbling Textile Jute Tire Parachute Violin Screen-printing Polystyrene Tennis shirt Magical thinking Sword making Craps Aloha shirt Diving suit Mario Canvas Washing machine Painting Welding David Beckham Polymethyl methacrylate Skirt and dress Rugby union positions Brush Pastel Hakama Fabrication (metal) Investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 Beachwear M1 Helmet Dry cleaning T-shirt Lacquer Football (soccer) Comanche Bong Stucco Necktie Sexual fetishism Condom Rubber stamp Cotton Hypothermia Singapore Police Force Deck (ship) Sock Strap-on dildo Printmaking Hat Heracles De Lorean DMC-12 Glove Camouflage Cochineal Dress shirt Bulletproof vest Gurkha Contingent Professional wrestling slang The Game (rapper) Aerial (dance move) Flax Stocking Wayne Corporation Animal Crossing Fan (implement) Nail (anatomy) Laser engraving Gambling Karategi

what is up with the mona lisa today i was exsaming the mona lisa portriat i was browsing the net on who she might be my theory is that she is leonardo de vinci s grandmother her name was monna lucia i belive that he drew her to where she looked younger any other theory s the theory that its leo himself is not too hard to imagine although it is all speculative leo could have easily been a transvestite and the mona lisa both a tribute to his granny and a self portrait signalling his trans nature but in the not so revealing form of communication of painting it can also be considered for other reasons leo may have been just posing as a woman in the tradition of theatre actors at the time who were mostly men even when female roles came up they were usually performed by men dressed as women all this stuff about it being a portrait of lisa gherardini wife of a famous florentine merchant is not at all in contradiction with the theory that it is also a self portrait any one who has studied art or is an artist knows that one art work can be many things at the same time yes you could be painting your best freind and also be portraying yourself at the same time  Mona Lisa Leonardo da Vinci The Da Vinci Code Raphael Renaissance Portrait Mona Lisa Smile Paint The Scream Sandro Botticelli Drawing Appropriation (art) The Last Supper (Leonardo) Andrea Mantegna Diego Vel__zquez Raphael Rooms Actor Drag queen Looney Tunes: Back In Action Artemisia Gentileschi Niccol__ Machiavelli Louvre Italian Renaissance Transvestism Girl Pontormo Cross-dressing Leonardo DiCaprio Michelangelo Salvador Dal__ Images of Jesus Amedeo Modigliani Hans Holbein the Younger Archibald Prize Art forgery Michael Caine Frans Hals Rembrandt Painting Art theft L.

do you like drawing do you like drawing or painting did you like drawing or painting when you were a child why why not do you think drawing or painting is difficult do you think a person can teach him or herself how to draw or paint do adults draw or paint very often what do you think about adults drawing or painting what are the benefits of drawing or painting to draw or paint well what factors do you think are important i do like to draw i love drawing and painting when i was a child i asked my mom to enroll me in painting classes when i was it is only difficult if you don't have the drive and there are just people that no matter how much you teach them they just can't draw but i think that when you really want to do something you can a person can definitely teach themselves how to draw i would recommend studying the human and animal anatomy and possibly find a studio where you can take life drawing classes adults who like draw they do it very often i think that if it's one of your passions or hobbies than i think adults drawing or painting is a wonderful thing my dad never went to art school but he absolutely loves to draw and i think it's great the benefits depend of what you want to get out of the drawings or painting if you are just doing it for the sake of doing it and you love it then it's great if you do it because you are going to be or are an artist that's also excellent i think whatever your reason for doing it is it should be something that you love to do drawing and painting that is because if you don't love to do it then it's pointless in my point of view i think that it is an important factor if you want to do something with your life that requires that skill i think anyone could learn i just don't think anyone should because some people really don't have the passion for it so to me it's only a skill that you need or want if that is one of your passions in life doing it as a way of making a living just for fun or hobby i don't think everyone should learn how to draw it's nor vital like reading and mathematics i hope this answers you questions and helps you out take care  GED Current teachings of Prem Rawat Abortion debate Past teachings of Prem Rawat Science Theory of conduct John Howard Yoder Economic inequality Second language acquisition Homeschooling Human Intelligence quotient Motivation Brett Whiteley Social rule Ludwig Wittgenstein Altruism Transactional analysis Expert system Figure drawing Aesthetic Realism Infantilism Art The Amber Spyglass Education in the People's Republic of China Meaning of life Avenue Q Aikido Human sexual behavior Leonardo da Vinci Boy Scouts of America Great Teacher Onizuka Nicomachean Ethics Eastern Orthodox Church Martial art Storytelling Justification (theology) Socrates Gifted Sexual orientation Roy Lichtenstein Education in the United States Philosophy of education Kender Philosophical skepticism Mental retardation Lie Kitsch Michel Henry Charles Grandison Finney Religion Supernatural Alexander Technique Rudolf Hermann Lotze Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Richard Feynman Adult attention-deficit disorder Pitaten Education in Hong Kong Ontological argument SAT Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Property (ownership right) Bah__'__ Faith and Education Hearing impairment Nurse A Course In Miracles Albrecht D__rer Education reform Kyle Broflovski Infant baptism Community college Scientology beliefs and practices Scientific method Summa Theologiae The Adventures of Pete & Pete Polyamory Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Evil Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Plame affair Sex education __douard Manet Graduate school Trigun Medicine Happiness Determinism Theodicy Joke Fathers' rights Autism Tom Phillips (artist) Growth hormone treatment

is there any stereotypes myths and ora about dolphins tattoos or paintings i've heard that when you get a painting or a statue of a elephant you want to make sure the tusk is pointed up kinda like you want to place a horse shoe pointing up over top your entrance of your home is there are certain way a dolphin should be pointed or placed and what is the symbolizm of dolphins i've got this nifty tattoo book that states the following about dolphin tattoos for the ancient greeks dolpins were symbols of both the divine and of wisdom the cretans people from the island of crete believed that the dead withdrew to the ends of the earth and that dolphins carried them there for mariners worldwide the dolphin was seen as a protector and guide again likely owing to accounts of dolphins attacking sharks to protect sailors who had fallen overboard as far as certain ways a dolphin should be pointed the book mentions that dolphins are often depicted in a repeating pattern forming arm bands or anklets  Crete Ecco the Dolphin Unicorn Aphrodite Battle of Crete Orion (mythology) Dolphin Icon Mythology U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program Minoan civilization Tattoo The Twelve Labours Zeus Celtic polytheism Horus Hecate Dionysus Minotaur Osiris Ouroboros Delphi Amulet Ganesha Antigonus II Gonatas Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Serpent Isis Bottlenose Dolphin History of swimming Orca Autostereogram Greco-Buddhism Labyrinth Art in Ancient Greece Ganymede Elephant Cetacean intelligence Apollo Taoism Pysanka Gal__pagos Islands Babylonian and Assyrian religion Phoenicia Shinto Sperm Whale Charge (heraldry) USS Dolphin (PG-24) Holy Spirit Shark Michael (archangel) Xiangqi Idolatry Eastern Orthodox Church Whale song Deluge (mythology) Odin Cretan Gendarmerie Queen's Guard Heraldry Demeter Clothing Paul Is Dead Ganges River Wood carving Archaeology and the Book of Mormon Columbine High School massacre Hell Theseus Resurrection of Jesus Vishnu Socrates Whale watching History of Modern Greece Celtic mythology Maya mythology European dragon Leviathan Shark Bay, Western Australia Jesus Human Aegean civilization Pentagram Troy Mal__si e Madhe District Europe Roman mythology Burial Greco-Buddhist art Boto Cretan Bull BloodRayne Iliad Chariot Aquaman Encantadia History of Crete Athena Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mithraism

how much should i charge for face painting i am doing face painting at a community event around how much should i charge i will do simple cheek art and full faces thanks the questions you have to ask are 'how long will it take to do a cheek and how long for a face ' now say you'd like to make dollars an hour for sitting around with the kids and give yourself minutes for each cheek painting and for the face sound about right that would make it for a cheek and for a face and that sounds pretty resonable for me as a customer however you know your audience so to speak and maybe they're the kind of people that are willing to pay or dollars for a cheek and for the face or even more consider the minimum wage in the area also so you are getting a price that's fair to you if it's for income for charity work lower prices always seem better because you'll get more customers in the long run  Minimum wage Progressive tax Wal-Mart Tax Microeconomics Hyperinflation Poker jargon Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Labor theory of value Supply and demand United Kingdom corporation tax Beard Welfare trap Labor-power Arbitrage The Price Is Right Price discrimination $ale of the Century Performance poetry The Apprentice 2 Keynesian economics Deflation (economics) Predatory lending Taxation in the United States National Kidney Foundation Singapore Economic inequality FairTax Education in the United States Health insurance Monopsony Inflation Enron Corporation Insurance Jeopardy!

what is the going rate for decorative sign painting i recently painted a large outdoor sign for a family friend's business and am wondering what the going rate to charge is the sign is about feet by feet pretty detailed and the job took about hours to complete do i charge hourly or by the job either way how much for a family friend thanks it's so much better to work these things out before you agree to do the work because there are so many factors that determine the price you'll ask and also because as you may very well learn before this is over many people do not think artists have the right to ask for money they think the words thank you are sufficient payment just look at the questions that come in here every day draw me this paint me that i need a logo i need a really good portrait of myself i need someone to change this in photoshop for my myspace page i need a custom tattoo design whaddya mean i should pay omg since when is art about profit you people are so greedy i hope this isn't going to ruin your friendship it has the potential if you can't come to terms ansyway assuming you are delighted with the end result and your friend is delighted with the end result here is what i would do take a photo of the sign and then go to a couple of printers signmakers in your area ask what it would cost roughly if you wanted to have a sign like that made that will give you an idea of the competitor's pricing take that figure and deduct a significant amount for your friendship how much is up to you ask for the amount left over be sure and give them an invoice it's a business expense and deductible  Insurance Microeconomics Life insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Wal-Mart Gross domestic product Tax Minimum wage Surplus value Supply and demand Inflation Xerox Flat tax Price discrimination Publicly funded medicine Unemployment Credit card Taxation in the United States Labour economics Intellectual property Public good Hyperinflation Monopoly Strategic management FairTax Law of value 401(k) Islamic banking Electronic commerce Social Security (United States) Tariff Sears Holdings Corporation Keynesian economics Micropayment Anarchism and capitalism The Apprentice 2 Corporate finance Poker jargon Externality Value added tax Economic inequality Capital accumulation Mutual fund Kyoto Protocol Annuity Economic rent Bond Internet fraud Progressive tax Mergers and acquisitions Deflation (economics) Mail fraud Profit PE ratio Apple Computer Arbitrage American individualist anarchism Welfare economics Citigroup Rational pricing Monetary policy Salary London Underground Leonardo da Vinci Illegal drug trade Art Income Vincent van Gogh Salvador Dal__ Prices of production DisneySpeak Trademark Ra (board game) Student loan Bank Mortgage Transformation problem Privatization Physical attractiveness Gold standard Pricing Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Socrates Predatory lending Technocratic movement Otakon EFTPOS Infantilism United States Postal Service Circuit design Henry H.

in basic painting what colors do i mix to get black if black is not available you can't but you could get a very very dark color mixing prussian blue and raw umber or any complementary like gamblin's chromatic black chromatic black a neutral tinting black made from complementary colors rather than the usual carbon or iron oxide blacks pigment chlorinated and bromated phthalocyanine quinacridone red b pg pv that's green and violet you would need professional materials because some student colors or house paints are mixed with white or other colors so if you mix complementaries you can get a light grey or a greenish grey another way is not mixing them but adding small layers of painting a red layer a blue layer a red layer a blue layer etc until you get a very dark color even another way is not adding layers but cross hatching dark colors lines of red cross hatch blue lines then cross hatch red lines etc until you get a very dark color what you are doing by this is blocking the light that your white paper or canvas is reflecting good luck  Color theory Color Pigment Black Georges-Pierre Seurat Blue Color blindness Glass CMYK color model Manganese Titanium Ultramarine Technicolor Staining (biology) White Paint Color space CIE 1931 color space Primary color Chromium Drawing Diamond Iris (anatomy) Hair coloring Diamond enhancement Impressionism Wassily Kandinsky Glaze Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Corrosion Pottery Sunglasses Eye color Light-emitting diode Green Lighting Phosphorus Yellow Ammolite Prussian blue Chlorine CD-R Carbon Tuff Circuit design Iron Opportunity rover Color vision Liquid crystal display Retina Stucco Rayleigh scattering Dragon Booster Human skin color Color temperature Tofu Hydrochloric acid M&M's Dominant wavelength Stellar evolution Magic: The Gathering Cloud Pointillism Beret Geology of the Grand Canyon area Harp Plastic Saturation (color theory) Pysanka Discus (fish) Colours, standards and guidons Mineral Garnet Chlorophyll E number Food coloring Gold Jan van Goyen Tattoo Color Graphics Adapter Diamond simulant James McNeill Whistler Photographic film Ultraviolet Casting Wallpaper group Sea-Monkey Sushi Camouflage

if i am oil painting is it ok to paint the whole background is it ok to paint the whole background red and then paint over the red with the white and the colors will not blend and my white will be its true color what im saying is is it ok to paint over a darker color with a lighter color and the dark will not show through also do you have to let it dry before you paint over the background sorry this is confusing i am used to watercolor i think its all been said thin layers to thick dark to light the only thing extra i can suggest is to mask the areas you want to be white with masking tape then do the red and let it dry for a couple of days when it is dry to the touch meaning so it won't blend with the white anymore remove the masking tape and mask the parts you want to leave red i don't know what you are painting so it is difficult to say more if you want the white to come forward more then you may want to try doing the whole thing red as thin as possible do you want a wash or something more opaque letting it dry and putting the white over it if the white is thick enough you should not have a problem anyway the most important thing is to experiment with all these suggestions yourself and see what works best because as you know personal experience is the best art teacher enjoy and the question did make sense i hope my answer did as well  Paint Color Drawing Watercolor painting Wood Impressionism Acrylic paint Color theory Typewriter Diving suit Wassily Kandinsky Casting Vitreous enamel Human skin color Leather Iris (anatomy) Shroud of Turin Abstraction Paper marbling Light-emitting diode Painting Geology of the Grand Canyon area Camouflage Glass Jan van Goyen Textile manufacturing __douard Manet Philosophy of language Coffee Billiards Upholstery Opportunity rover Cocoa Japanese tea ceremony Traditional animation Rum The Wall Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Knife Wok Sushi Tempera Technicolor M16 (rifle) Social rule Plastic Rayleigh scattering Portrait miniature Pysanka Pastel Phosphorus Sun Physical attractiveness Floppy disk Tea Blue Ice hockey Tobacco Yellow Past teachings of Prem Rawat Black Chocolate Fancy rat Diamond cut Dodge Charger IPod Tofu Irna Phillips E.

new to oil painting help i am new to oil painting and i am starting with m graham walnut oil paints i have never painted with oil before so not only am i new to all this but it seems to be a little hard to find anything online that can tell me how to use this brand of paint i am overwhelmed with all there is to know about oil painting so it has been a lot to take in and i am really nervous because i spent a ton of money on all my supplies so i dont want to screw this up in any way i am going to be taking classes but i know that the instructor will be busy helping other people out as well so i wanted to know a little bit about how to use the paint so that i dont go in there completely blind to all this i have painted with watercolour most of my life so i am not new to painting just oil i also wanted to know what you would recommend i paint for my first time i paint and draw figures but i think that may be too complicated for my first time what do any of you recommend i make my living selling my oil paintings and have used m graham walnut oil paints for over years they differ from other brands in that they are creamier than most not needing a thinning medium but very dense in color so the colors are bright and will not dull easily when white is added cheaper student paints have less actual color and more fillers use these paints as you would any other oil paint they mix with other brands if you find a color you want to try by another manufacturer the major difference between oils and watercolors is that you can correct or change oils over and over by just rubbing the wet paint off or painting over the dry paint and you have more control and rely less on those painterly accidents that give watercolor it's characteristic charm and frustrations to someone like me taking classes is an good idea just make sure you want to learn to paint the way the teacher paints because that is all he she will be able to teach i found the most valuable information in the videos by artist teacher helen van wyke i own many but they are rentable at www art video com and often played on public television stations start with the videos on the palette colors cast shadows and brush strokes shaping with paint helen teaches the basics with humor painting right in front of you so you can see how the paint and brushes behave once you know the basics you can paint anything painting an apple is like painting a person's head and vice versa so just begin with the subject you are most comfortable with or enjoy when in doubt remember there really are no mistakes in art look at monet's waterlily paintings sometimes the waterlilies are green sometimes purple sometimes red and all beautiful good luck i am sure you will have alot of fun exploring this medium  Watercolor painting Paint Drawing Impressionism Color Wassily Kandinsky Japanese tea ceremony Color theory Georgia O'Keeffe Academic art Francis Bacon (painter) Atari 8-bit family Knife Pastel Carl Barks Traditional animation Photography Aesthetic Realism Tempera Typewriter Casting Brush Plastic El Lissitzky Mnemonic Pierre-Auguste Renoir Martial art Jan van Goyen Violin Dog training Microeconomics Frans Hals Fountain pen Drill bit Floppy disk Vincent van Gogh Leather United States dollar Painting Light-emitting diode Graduate school My Little Pony Wood carving Great Teacher Onizuka Hangul A Course In Miracles IPod Color Graphics Adapter Cascading Style Sheets Gamut Extreme Programming IBM PC compatible Timpani Gross domestic product Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Avenue Q Peruvian cuisine Tag Education in the People's Republic of China Bob and George Jacques Maroger Color blindness Microsoft Paint M.C.

yellow ribbon swastika rage against the machine is right yes it is a true comparison to make in the words of noam chomsky if the same laws that were applied to the nazi's after ww were applied to us presidents then every single one of them from truman onwards would be hung to death and shot ignorance is bliss people you don't want to acknowledge that your own government is a brutal and cruel killing machine for fear of your own comforts and securities being taken away from you the comparison is not harsh in the slightest we kill and get away with it we cause misery and suffering to millions including our own in what the name of freedom well then sit back and relax and watch as your government increases its debt your debt to foreign nations watch as your society crashes around you when the dollar is worthless and when foreigners decide to invade your nation to reclaim what you owe them far fetched you say we'll see its only when something catastrophic happens that people realise the reality they actually live in  Freedom of speech Anti-communism Kosovo War Noam Chomsky The Holocaust Capital punishment War on Terrorism EastEnders Government debt Slavery Harry S.

stupid question would painting one wall black in my room look weird and does anyone know any good decorating room sites okay the other colours would be a light purple lime green red but not all three no it would not look weird at all depending upon your personal style you could choose a few different options the first being a modern high end look and the second being a more funky artistic melange mix for the first room i would paint the remaining walls in a silvery grey colour the trim work doors and ceiling would be in a warm white to play up to and dramatize the matt black painted wall i would incorporate these next three elements consistently throughout the space glass and crystal silver metal stainless steele and a combination of dark and cream furniture the fabric choices should be a mixture of stripes circular patterns and well executed plaids and incorporate florals or fauna for a woman and bold graphics for a male cushions drapes chair seats and if in your bedroom bedding with crisp white sheets with a black profile around the edges fabrics should be of different weaves and textures to create a layering effect with visual and tactile interest ex material silk fine wool cotton etc texture nubby soft smooth and raised fabrics your lamps should be of brushed stainless or glass bases with black shades you could have a modern silver pendant lamp hanging from the ceiling or a cream chandelier again with black shades if you allergy permits a nice simple biege rug with a black border after all this is accomplished you would need to purchase the same stlye and colour of frames for artwork that you love they do not have to be as monochromatic as is the theme of this type of room stripes in an alternating matt shiney finish would look great in this room too stencils like these in either decor would look great very graphic and well done http www stencil library com for room version two black matt wall ceiling and trim work the three remaining walls in your choice of ethier a grey mauve silvery blue or rustic orange from there your picture frames are black with bolder and brighter pieces of art work your rug will have the colours that are in your art work and will co ordinate with your lamps and other do dads and objects in your space your fabrics should not be the focal point in this situation you art work should be so keep them as close as possible to the colour of your wall on which it will be near ie black fabrics black wall and so on the texture rule suggestion applies to this scenario as well you can incorporate plastic plexi glass various metals silver and black or coloured and coloured glass into the room so your table lamps vases and decor would be of these materials lampshades can still be black to retain some cohesion in the room furniture is nuetral to show case the more artistic elements in the room nothing too light though good decorating websites are below for you to browse through http www hgtv com hgtv decorating hgtv
