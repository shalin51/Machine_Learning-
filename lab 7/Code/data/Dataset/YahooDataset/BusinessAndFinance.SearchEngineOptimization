why do you think the redemption rate is so much higher for online coupons versus sunday paper coupons and would you use coolsavings com to print coupons for your regular purchases such as groceries magazines music beauty supplies etc the rate will be higher for online coupons because people search these items out however total usage is still higher with newspaper coupons because it cheap advertising we easily save per month on groceries and household items we only use coupons for items we regularly buy unless it is a full price coupon which makes it free while we use coupons for all of our shopping we rarely use online coupons including coolsavings com because the newspaper coupons are much more valuable for example why use a cent coupon online when the newspaper has a cent coupon for the same item here's my best advice invest in sunday newspapers and clip out the coupons for the coupons you use most often go to ebay where you can purchase extras at a very reasonable price in our household we focus on high dollar items like coffee milk juice and hard cheeses we usually pay no more than for coupons including shipping a first class stamp and envelopes the coupons we don t use are resold to neighbors or co workers which recoups our ebay costs here's a direct link to the listings http health beauty listings ebay com coupons w qq trksidzm qqsacatz qqsocmdzlistingitemlist if you go online here's a couple web sites we do frequent for product news trials recipes and occasionally a coupon http www pg com en us products index jhtml http www kraftfoods com kf e email  Bond Electronic commerce Wal-Mart Amazon.com Direct marketing Am730 Inflation Neopets Philatelic investment Price discrimination Zero coupon bond Supermarket Bulk vending Postage stamps and postal history of the United States Charles Ponzi Treasury security America Online Gross domestic product Sing Tao Daily Tesco Insurance Sears Holdings Corporation Digital photography Newspaper Google Microeconomics Spyware Advertising Mutual fund Overclocking MMORPG Something Awful Forums Internet fraud Mail fraud Gmail Open access Web traffic Credit derivative Retailer Milk Deflation (economics) Search engine optimization Sales promotion Online marketing Surveillance Privatization Yahoo!

why are car surfaces not used for advertising most private cars do not have any advertisments on them is it prohibited to put ad on personal cars i would think that some companies would figure out a way of rewarding drivers for the right to advertise on their cars there are some companies that do offer money and or gas for the advertising to be placed on your vehicle the thing is that most people do not want any such thing on their vehicles there can be damage to the paint and then there is the thing about people stealing magnets and vandalism i have my own website across the back of my trailblazer but would not put anything else on it  Auto insurance Taxicab Billboard (advertising) Grand Theft Auto III Sport utility vehicle Automobile Insurance Personal rapid transit Lionel Corporation Freeway Road safety Gran Turismo (game) Battery electric vehicle Internet fraud Driver's license Radio controlled car Filling station Tire Grand Theft Auto (game) Scale model Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Drag racing Hybrid vehicle Road-rule enforcement camera Vehicle registration plate Coach Mail Audi Steering wheel Wayne Corporation Limousine Contract School bus Rear wheel drive Toronto Transit Commission Mercedes-Benz Auto Train (Amtrak) Wankel engine Headlight Ambulance Need for Speed Ford Thunderbird Key (lock) Car handling Islamic banking Airbag Road Tobacco advertising Scion (car) Car safety BMW Manual transmission Neopets National Kidney Foundation Singapore Transformers: Robots in Disguise Toyota Camry Police car Porsche 911 Henry Ford De Lorean DMC-12 The Apprentice 2 Chevrolet Camaro America Online Chrysler Corporation V8 Supercar 1973 oil crisis Formula One Hitchhiking High-occupancy vehicle Rules of the road Ford Motor Company Honda Car sharing Truck Prostitution Renault Disc brake Ives Manufacturing Company Dodge Neon London Congestion Charge Hydrogen vehicle Road traffic accident Suicide methods Rest area Credit card John De Lorean Ferrari Affiliate Union Pacific Railroad Porsche Saskatchewan Government Insurance Straight-6 Drunk driving (United States) Motorcycle Goldfinger Car and Driver Firefighter Mercedes-Benz A-Class Yugo </TEXT>
