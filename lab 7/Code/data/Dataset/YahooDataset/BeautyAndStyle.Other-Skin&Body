foundation question what is the best foundation that you ever had why please tell me your skin condition why that product was best for your skin type please thank you p s another question what is foundation really used for and could it be a substitute for concealer my experience with bare escentuals also known as bare minerals has been great i have some deep scars on my nose from plastic surgery and some broken veins on my nose from the needles inserted in my nose as pain killer my face also had a lot of red blotches from the sun nothing i ever wore worked until i bought bare minerals all i have to do is apply this product using the kabuki brush and my scars and red blotches and broken veins disappear i am not a skin consultant and i do not push any product on line if i am selliing it i am just someone who has searched for a good cover up without the look of the chalky appearance when i started using bare minerals my face actually looked healthy no talc in this product it holds on your face even when you perspire a bit from the heat the other good thing about it is that it is refundable if you do not like it you can also wear the makeup overnight and it helps your skin i don't do this cause i like to remove my make up before going to bed but this is a statement made by the company i am asking you to give it a try the other products out there have only copied this but have not perfected it for example cover girl physician's formula l oreal and now arbonne i just want to tell you about this because i know it is true again full refund is given if you do not like it best wishes for a healthy glowing skin tone without looking like you have a lot of caked makeup on your face i have ordered arbonne to try because a friend is selling it but that was over a month ago and i have not received it yet so when i do i will be able to tell if this works better but i doubt that it will  Tattoo Intravenous therapy Scar Brassiere Cosmetics Acupuncture Acne Earring Dialysis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Dragon Booster Side Characters (Xenosaga) RuneScape quests Skin Urinary incontinence Shaggy dog story Columbine High School massacre Theory of conduct Mattress Jiddu Krishnamurti Prostate cancer Insulin Psoriasis EastEnders First aid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Plastic surgery Cellulitis Milton H.

cystic acne again i have asked questions about this before but i am on meds for my cystic acne i have been on bactrim and clindamycin gel for two weeks but today i started forming more new cysts i am so depressed i can't even focus on anything i hate to look at myself in the mirror all i see are these huge red cysts and along with that scars and discoloration from future skin issues i know i know give the medicine time i hear that all the time but when you look like this you just wish someone would say oh this is what you can do unfortunately i understand there really isn't anything you can do about cystic acne but if anyone has any ideas please feel free to let me know thank you you probably hear this a lot but one thing to prevent acne in general is to drink you're glasses of water a day keeping you're body hydrated well is important not just for internal organs but you're skin needs it to consistently clean it self and rid it self of toxins that you're body takes in during the day also try to eat a lot of vegtables and fruit of course keep it in balance with other foods but make sure you have at least fruits a day and a salad almond oil works one slowly deminishing scars but wait until the acne is pretty much gone because the last thing you need is oil on acne it just doesn't mix but after for the scars use almond oil i know this because my friend had severe acne and i helped her get through that whole hate to look at myself in the mirror thing also this seemed to work for her to keep her skin clean and free of acne http www xanga com ricebunny aspririn beautiful skin html of course it does't work on all skins depending on each person and how they eat how they live how active they are it depends on you're life style really sometimes on genes but not most of the time i know some other things that might help if you like just e mail me i hope this helps and that you're cystic acne slowly demishes i personally have no idea how that must feel but from having a close friend go through the same thing i can tell how it affects people possibly talk to you're dermatologist about other treatments also  Acne Scar Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fecal incontinence Social rule Psoriasis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Diarrhea Rosacea Skin Theory of conduct Prostate cancer Cystic fibrosis Pneumonia Tocopherol Cirrhosis Isotretinoin Urinary incontinence Tofu Spina bifida Wound healing phases Tuberculosis Fasting Cephalic disorder Autism Puberty Stomach cancer Amineptine Escherichia coli O157:H7 Eczema Fancy rat Group A streptococcal infection Cancer Pitaten Radiation therapy Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Characters in the Smurfs Medicine Keloid Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Shaggy dog story Hearing impairment Antidepressant Hypoglycemia Dietary fiber Current teachings of Prem Rawat Chronic fatigue syndrome Anthrax Insulin Lupus erythematosus Stroke Piccolo Junior Saga Sewage treatment Tooth Folic acid Borderline personality disorder Veganism Time Out of Mind Yoga Sutras of Patanjali World Wide Web Cleanser Hyperthermia About a Boy Bipolar disorder Jiddu Krishnamurti Hiberno-English Garfield Marathon (sport) Allergy Clinical depression Ultraviolet Karen Horney Salad Fingers Kosher foods Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Autistic community Common cold Herpes simplex virus Baldness treatments Anorexia nervosa Botulism Multiple sclerosis Protein-energy malnutrition Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Drosophila melanogaster Alcoholics Anonymous Science Phoebe Halliwell Malaria Kodocha

i hate my nose help its making me depressed i think im really ugly for some reason i think my nose is really flat and wide and even my mom says 'that's okay you have your dads nose' when i complain about it i don't want to get surgery but what can i do to make it look thinner with make up or whatever its causing me to feel inferior first off realize that the cute fake button nose of hollywood is lame and unoriginal my friend has this perfect little nose and she can't breathe out of it seriously secondly if you want to accentuate the beauty of your nose there are ways to sculpt with makeup that will bring it into a more positive light just remember that you make the make up look beautiful and not the other way around research make up techniques like contouring and highlighting any half decent make up technique book will teach it to you i used robert jones' make up makeovers bottom line play with the paints if you want but try loving yourself instead of picking at yourself i ended up growing into my nose and i've come to appreciate that it is unique and yet still attractive beauty is something that is radiated from within it is how you treat yourself and others beauty animates the face not the other way around besides i'd rather be able to breathe out of my nose and have it help me sing than pay big bucks for a nose millions of people already have good luck and god speed maybe it will take some time but one day you'll wake up and say hey you i love you and by the way you are looking sassy fine today i wish i had the magic words to make you feel better  The Adventures of Pete & Pete Garfield Equine conformation Mouse (computing) Frankie Laine The Fairly OddParents Rocko's Modern Life Poker jargon Kylie Minogue Clown My Life as a Teenage Robot Bhagavad Gita Physical attractiveness Knots Landing Characters in the Smurfs Piccolo Junior Saga Cole Porter Cliff Richard Past teachings of Prem Rawat The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Negima Ren and Stimpy The Angry Beavers Cosmetics Megan Griffin Humphrey Bogart Skateboarding trick Current teachings of Prem Rawat Mattress Pok__mon Live!

what is a good bath shower oil that also smells great and keeps you moisturzed and smooth thanks for the help if you want smooth skin use johnson's baby wash which is incredibly gentle to your skin pour some in the palm of your hand and then pour some baking soda in your palm and mix them up and rub your palms over the parts of your body that are rough when i get to my feet i use a cuticle brush to scrub my toe nails and the heels and bottom of my feet rinse all that off and you won't believe how nice your skin feels you have to be careful with oil in the shower you get it on the floor of the tub shower stall and the next person may slip and be seriously hurt the best way to put on oil is to turn off the shower brush your hands down your arms and body and legs to get most of the water off pour a little oil in your palm rub your hands together and rub the oil on when you get to your feet just oil the tops and when you get out of the tub put a towel on the floor to stand on and rub one foot on top of the other to get oil on your soles then gently pat the rest of the moisture off your skin if my feet are really dry i'll put a lot of oil on and sometimes an hydroxy acid lotion and put on some white socks and wear them to bed what kind of oil you can go to the health food stores and look for the body oils they get a little pricey so some people just use olive oil experiment look and see what oils are in the expensive blends and you can buy them individually more cheaply scents are tricky i generally don't suggest them because they are often irritating to sensitive skin but if you want buy a couple at the health store and try mixing just a little at a time lavender is soothing and calming but do your research in aroma therapy and choose the scents you like take good care of your skin don't suntan wear your sunblock don't smoke you know the drill when you are fifty and your smoking friends look like they are and you look like you are you will be glad you did good luck  Manicure Massage Sauna Customs and etiquette of Japan Sento Upholstery Acne Eczema Fecal incontinence Soap Perfume Urticaria Irish dance Textile manufacturing Urinary incontinence Olive oil Reflexology Social rule Dog Menstrual cup Pottery Durian Comanche Aerial (dance move) Tattoo Essential oil Chocolate Smoke-screen Hand washing Mattress Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Coffee Equine conformation Vampire Horse Professional wrestling attacks Diving suit Humphrey Bogart Sock Callus Professional wrestling holds Brewery Tofu Shampoo Wound Skin Dairy Bacon Aloe Japanese tea ceremony Sunscreen Japanese toilet Guinea pig Fancy rat Tocopherol Cheese Fast bowling Bread Happy Tree Friends Professional wrestling match types Sunburn Woodworking Rice Towel Plastic Bathing Vitamin D Hair Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Phoebe Buffay's songs Cleanser 108 form Wu family T'ai Chi Ch'uan Strap-on dildo Boxing Wok Casting Hemp Scabies Shaving Characters of Naruto Characters in the Smurfs Halitosis Charles Darwin's illness Yarrow Insomnia Glossary of partner dance terms Cosmetics Menstrual cycle

industrial piercing i really want to get an industrial piercing and i am like sure but the only thing stopping me is knowing that there will be big holes in my ear if i decide to take it out and never put it in will the holes ever close up if when i decide to remove it and also if you have ur pierced can u share ur expierience of getting it pierced and things that i shood know b hand oh and if you can please send me a link or website about it with pics and stuff thanks the holes close up pretty fast once its removed but you can still put a bar through if you want as long as you allow it to heal keep it clean just as you would any normal cartilidge piercing except make sure the bar is kept clean too as it can get quite dirty causing it to be unhygienic and not look good due to bits of dried lymph on it usually what the pierce should do is take a measurement and get a bar to that size then mark it up for both angle and distance then do seperate piercings and pass the bar through just like putting in normal jewellery if its not put in place properly it can cause it to be very uncomfortable hence why its important to get it done accuratly and have both done at the same if possible theres plenty of stuff on bme however i think you can only view so many pics before you have to register and either pay or contribute ive been a member for some time now so am unsure as to how many it is good luck  Drill bit Violin Knife Hamster Poker jargon Prince Albert piercing Barbell (piercing) Social rule Body piercing Archery Terminal ballistics Fast bowling Condom Sampling (music) Thermal power station GunBound Diamond Screw U.S. presidential election, 2000 Tattoo 2000 Australian Grand Prix Humphrey Bogart Dairy Tenshinhan Vampire Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ear piercing instrument Betting (poker) Swimming Eyepiece Naruto jutsu Swingout First Battle of the Atlantic Upholstery Menstrual cup Dry cleaning 2005 Belgian Grand Prix CPU cache American football strategy EastEnders Nine Inch Nails Franklin Pierce Milton H.

should i pop my whiteheads or just leave them alone and they'll go away on their own also would you recommend proactiv for somebody with sensitive skin combination skin type does proactiv work for all acne i am thinking of trying it i did try it once but not even for a month i don't think i was seeeing results i don't think i was using it long enough typically how long should you wait to see results from what ive read and been told you should pop whiteheads but rather than just using dirty fingers its recommended that you pop them either following a thorough washing of your hands or with a sterilized needle like a sewing needle you can easily sterilize a needle by placing it in hot soapy water the purpose of sterilizing needles or your hands is so that once you break the skin additional bacteria doesnt get caught in that area dont forget to wash your face x daily ive personally tried proactiv and yeah it works but is costly and somewhat time consuming theres steps to the process proactiv is perfect for sensitive skin but again id check out some of the over the counter sensitive skin treatments from clearasil or the like if it wasnt working at all for you in weeks after consistent use it probably wont work hope this helps  Psoriasis Acne Tattoo Textile manufacturing Intravenous therapy Menstrual cup Body piercing Ultraviolet Agar plate Wound Skin Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gramophone record Pneumonia Dialysis Atomic Kitten Escherichia coli O157:H7 Sterilization (microbiology) Acupuncture Sewing machine CPU cache Knife Tuberculosis treatment Bacteria Sewage treatment Disinfection Swimming Urticaria Hand washing Soap Wine making Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Bone marrow transplant Hygiene Group A streptococcal infection Surveillance Scar Hepatitis C She Loves You Suture XML Houseplant Fecal incontinence AIDS Breast cancer Earring Billboard Hot 100 Social rule Polymerase chain reaction Chlorpromazine Androgen insensitivity syndrome Hay fever Insulin Naval mine Nail (anatomy) Embedded system Methamphetamine Mantoux test Debugging Jessica Simpson Allergy Dairy Cleanser Puberty Hamster Hard water Female genital cutting Jennifer Lopez Oscilloscope Hair Aerial (dance move) Upholstery Polycystic ovary syndrome Human rights in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq Herpes simplex virus Asepsis Clothing Blood donation Information Technology Infrastructure Library Violin Ives Manufacturing Company Halitosis Customs and etiquette of Japan Humphrey Bogart Cholera Kayak Dyslexia Torpedo Ebola Capercaillie Jon Secada Foodborne illness Tooth Mosquito Tofu Play piercing

multi vitamin pills for acne please help i have multi vitamin pills by natures made is it good for helping acne or bad please help me vitamin a and e generally help the skin but overdoing it can be bad for you make sure if you use supplements that you avoid eating too many foods containing beta carotene like orange fruits and veggies you'll turn orange and likely have problems related to overdosing on beta carotene if you really want to up your vitamins it's better to get them from whole foods carrot sticks make a transportable snack or side and cantaloupe is in season any of the squashes would also help winter squashes have to be cooked but summer squashes like yellow and zucchini can be eaten raw or cooked why don't you ask your doctor about taking beta carotene supplements they are really what you need along with eating foods cooked in olive oil or other high omega oils but beta carotene can be dangerous which is why you need to ask your doctor there are plenty of soaps as well that promise clearer skin generally fragrance free soaps that moisturize like lever and dove are better for your skin than harsh deodorant soaps like irish spring there are also creams or astringents that are made specifically for acne if you want a topical medication if you have trouble with the oxy products whose active ingredient benzoyl peroxide is an allergen for some you can use stridex pads which use salicylic acid if that even irritates your skin you might have to abandon topicals vitamins can help your skin as long as you're taking the right ones below is a site which talks about vitamins for acne the reason i mention the topicals and the soap is sometimes a three pronged attack works better than using only one or two methods it helped me to not eat greasy food i cooked a lot and realized by cooking ground beef or other greasy foods i would end up with grease on my face so if you do cook make sure you are washing your face after cooking anything that spatters it also helped me to reduce my sugar intake everyone is different so even if the vitamins don't work or any other method i've mentioned there is always something out there different good luck i had trouble with acne as a teen and was allergic to everything whatever you do try to avoid antibiotic treatment for your acne i developed an allergy to sulfa drugs and tetracycline because they were used to treat my acne they really aren't necessary if you can find out what's behind your acne problem and fixing it instead of just focusing on the symptom if you have a lot of painful large acne cysts i'd recommend seeing a dermatologist they are usually brought on by hormonal changes and the doctor can give you stronger topicals and recommend specific vitamins if you're trying to be as natural as possible in your treatments  Tocopherol Fecal incontinence Vitamin D Veganism Food Eczema Vitamin Folic acid Vitamin C Milk Prostate cancer Insulin Allergy Nutrition Guinea pig Scar Rosacea Common cold Omega-3 fatty acid Cancer Atherosclerosis Dietary fiber Pharmacology Osteoarthritis Stomach cancer Vegetarianism Asthma Raw food diet Crohn's disease Chronic fatigue syndrome Urinary incontinence Soap Breastfeeding Shampoo Mouth ulcer First aid Garlic Hay fever Rice Hamster Escherichia coli O157:H7 Tattoo Carrot Dandruff Hydrogen peroxide Alzheimer's disease Diarrhea Hypoglycemia Chocolate Migraine Aloe Sewage treatment Coffee Anorexia nervosa Baldness treatments Herpes simplex virus Cuisine of Denmark Tofu Soybean Dieting Dermatology Rooibos Squash (fruit) Peanut Medicine Colorectal cancer Potato Fibromyalgia Aspirin Tooth enamel Gastroesophageal reflux disease Essential oil Breakfast Multiple sclerosis Ice cream Soy milk Golden rice Tooth Cannabis (drug) Foodborne illness Protein Olive oil Clinical depression Ultraviolet Perfume

shampoo's shower gels why is it that no matter what colour the shampoo shower gel is pink green blue when it lathers its always white let us see how soap lathers what makes soap lather soap molecules are long chains of atoms that have two main parts a polar head that is attracted to water molecules and repelled by oil and a hydrocarbon tail that is repelled by water and attracted to oil the hydrophobic water fearing tails of the soap molecules naturally try to get out of a watery solution and collect at any available surface when that surface is air the soap molecules arrange themselves in an orderly layer with the hydrophilic water loving heads in the water and their oil loving tails in the air shaking a soap and water solution introduces pockets of air that when big enough appear as bubbles a thin film of soap molecules coats each pocket creating a bubble when the shaking stops the bubbles float to the surface more soap and more stirring allow the formation of smaller bubbles foam or lather is just a conglomerate of these tiny soap bubbles although many people associate lather with the cleaning properties of soap it is actually an incidental property resulting from the way the soap molecules are drawn to dirt and oil since neither the polar head that is attracted to water molecules and repelled by oil and the hydrocarbon tail that is repelled by water and attracted to oil are coloured the lather is white the chemicals added for colouring the soap do not play any active part in the lathering process  Soap bubble Alkane Water (molecule) Soap Liquid crystal Cell (biology) Origin of life Shampoo Water Plastic Lipid Glycerin Brewery Micelle Explosive material Carbon Biochemistry Haloalkane Hard water Carbon dioxide Ice core Polyelectrolyte Sulfuric acid Amino acid Corrosion Fire extinguisher Sewage treatment Hydrogen chloride Corona discharge Sento Ammonia Hydrogen Ozone depletion Vacuum Cracking (chemistry) Ozone layer Acetic acid Motor oil Solvent Textile manufacturing Chemistry Glass Hydrochloric acid Alternative biochemistry Paint Helium Ozone hole Abiogenic petroleum origin Copper extraction Pottery Color Magnet Citric acid Staining (biology) Temperature Ecology Fire fighting Shaving Phospholipid Natural gas Diamond Bong Molecular biology Renewable energy Aromatic hydrocarbon Cloud Mattress Molecule Action potential Tocopherol Formic acid Ethylene Cheese Phase (matter) Oil refinery Naval mine Nuclear magnetic resonance Biological membrane Carrageenan Thermal power station Organic chemistry Polyethylene terephthalate Motility Polychlorinated biphenyl Sulfur DNA Colloid Cell membrane Hydrogen peroxide Nanotechnology Cast iron

why does my new nail polish dry out after using it a couple times i just bought a very pretty dark dark red nail polish by revlon and it started to dry out and became hard to use after just two applications this seems to happen with every type of nail polish i try although more with darker colors than the lighter ones why does this happen and is there anything i can do i know it's not because of leaving the top off it just got so hard to apply the second time i used it i'll try the acetone thing though thanks make sure you wipe the top of the bottle off before putting the cap back on if you let polish dry on the threads of the bottle it can cause little gaps that can let air in and dry the polish out also it could be old to begin with even though you just bought it some stores have polish forever on their shelves before it is sold also try putting a very small amount of vaseline around the threads of the bottle this will help to keep the cap from sticking and also keep air out close it tightly after each use and only leave it open while you are using it close it as soon as you are done with it also try using some good quality polish like opi essie creative nail design china glaze and there are a few more good ones you will get better end results and it will be well worth the extra money spent on them one other thing if your polish gets thick after having it for a while you can thin it with a few drops of nail polish thinner don't use polish remover buy thinner made specifically for thinning polish you can find it in most beauty supply stores as for the top quality brands of polish you can find them for sale in many nail salons and also you can get some in a beauty supply store as well depending on the brand i would suggest staying away from the cheaper brands they're just not worth it in the long run  Textile manufacturing Trademark Wood Diamond Glass Upholstery Poker jargon IPod Drill bit Seismic retrofit Tofu Solar cell Champagne (beverage) Cigar RuneScape economy Hard disk Casting Brewery Diving suit Digital photography Beer USB flash drive Japanese tea ceremony 2000 Australian Grand Prix Illegal drug trade Floppy disk Final Fantasy XI Time Out of Mind Billiards Bicycle lighting Transformer Hyperinflation RuneScape skills Nintendo Circuit design Earring Sears Holdings Corporation Colours, standards and guidons Tire Textile manufacturing terminology Spark plug Plastic Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Solvent Tobacco Ramen Alcoholic beverage Tea Money DVD Violin Rum Sake Shoe polish Diamond cut Menstrual cup Bulk vending Paintball Impressionism Paint Mouse (computing) Nintendo DS Second Battle of the Atlantic Ammolite Nine Inch Nails ITunes Music Store Coffee Gas metal arc welding Typewriter Pysanka Pharmaceutical company Sand casting Mach kernel Condom Cider Thermal power station Diablo II: Lord of Destruction 1957 World Series Geology of the Grand Canyon area M16 (rifle) Drag racing Sea level rise C programming language Aluminium CPU design Cigarette Carpet

girls only please i guess this is a little embarrassing but hey isnt that what this is for how do you get that perfect shave and reduction in bumbs down there wax leaves lots of bruises and razor leaves bumps whats left thanks bunches for any response if you're going for the shave keep the skin moist with a creamy shave cream for sensitive skin the object is not to allow your skin to dry out at any point even after you've shaved that area after the shave use a soothing tea tree oil product or mix your own tea tree concentrate with baby oil this should help keep the bumpy problem down note going over and over the same area for sensitive skin is a no no so make sure your razor is a new one as for the waxing and bruising omg you did this yourself or you had it done if you had this done to you stay far away from this person try someone else that knows what they are doing if you did this yourself the reason for the bruising is the skin pulled up and snapped back when the strip was removed because the skin area was not held taunt or the wax was too thick this causes bruising and even possibly loss of skin waxing really should be left to the professionals i was taught to use the baby powder and keep the skin dry for waxing what i have found over the yrs is this is not really such a good idea especially for sensitive skin i always use a tea tree oil baby oil mixture before and after wax application less discomfort and by far a better waxing result  Pubic hair Shaving Casting Depilation Psoriasis Essential oil Fecal incontinence Leather Waxing Urinary incontinence Eczema Tofu Cosmetics Razor Breastfeeding Coffee Perfume Haircut The Inside Earwax Transformer Knife Ice cream Hair Soap Tattoo Sento Carnivorous plant 613 mitzvot Cocoa Brazilian waxing Dairy Alkane Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Wax play Yarrow Thermal power station Gilding Motor oil Teapot Manicure Happy Tree Friends Philosophy of science Stomach cancer Mango Japanese cuisine Rooibos Glycerin Curry Handloading Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Androgen insensitivity syndrome Honey Global Gillette Comanche Equine conformation Japanese tea ceremony Tanning Cinnamon Tobacco 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Cocaine Hemp Social rule Sulfuric acid Plantain Kava Phonograph cylinder Tea Matcha Pseudofolliculitis barbae Maple syrup Drill bit Radiation therapy Massage Livestock Brewery Solvent Mosquito Aluminium Mummy Kurt Angle Butterfly Group A streptococcal infection Head shaving Baldness Callus EastEnders Cantonese cuisine Fast bowling Sewage treatment Sand casting Diving

acne blackheads question easy points does toothpaste do anything for blackheads or acne anything at all points to the best and the most correct answer thanks in advance for all serious answers can toothpaste heal pimples toothpaste as a home remedy for acne is nothing new but the question is does it work some people swear by the unconventional treatment saying that a dab of fluoride paste significantly reduces the size and redness of pimples by drying them out thinking of using a bit of paste for your latest pimple problem there are a few things to consider first don't paste your face if you opt for the toothpaste use it sparingly just a dab directly on a few zits don't apply it broadly across your face in case you have a skin sensitivity to the product does the skin around your mouth develop redness and irritation following toothbrushing if so you might have a sensitivity in that case you might want to forego trying this home remedy altogether but if you go forward with your plans perhaps apply the toothpaste first to a couple of pimples that are out of sight on your chest or back if you have an acne breakout there don't use gel users report that gel toothpastes are not as effective as regular fluoride toothpastes so stick with the basics  Acne Mouth ulcer Fluoride therapy Psoriasis Scar Eczema Halitosis Tooth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tooth enamel Keloid Fluoride Dental caries Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Apprentice 2 Smallpox Procter & Gamble Alexander Technique Aloe Explosive material Androgen insensitivity syndrome Hair Fecal incontinence Radiation therapy Tattoo Equine conformation Homeopathy Benzoyl peroxide Stuttering Theory of conduct Software testing Amineptine M60 machine gun Modem Expert system Medicine Pneumonia Stomach cancer The nature of God in Western theology ISO 9000 Transsexuality M16 (rifle) Common cold Cleanser Chocolate Body piercing Women in Islam GunBound Extreme Programming Loudspeaker Isotretinoin Scarification Classified information Digital audio broadcasting Theodicy Garlic Zits Patent medicine Photography Testosterone Alternative medicine Delphi method Toothbrush Copy protection Domestic violence Sento Hypoglycemia Defibrillator Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Digital photography Hydrofluoric acid Fluorine Snake Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Allergy Zerg Table tennis Eye Sodium dodecyl sulfate Mass spectrometry Coercion Polycystic ovary syndrome Tuberculosis The Legend of Zelda series enemies Strap-on dildo Dentistry Floppy disk Dualism (philosophy of mind) Equal Protection Clause Ammonia Breast cancer Internet troll Antiretroviral drug Intravenous therapy

is warm hot or cold water better for pimples why how do u know i live in california and at room temperature here animal fat is solid so then i would think warm water is better cuz it allows the pores to be cleared out but i've also heard that cold water is better because it is more soothing on the skin and irritation causes pimples but im not sure exactly so you have the basic idea already cold water is better at soothing skin it cause vasoconstriction reducing any sort of inflammation or puffiness warm water is better because it does allow some fats to be in a liquid states and it causes vasodialation and dialation of the pores which allow the irritants to be removes someone previous to me mentioned that you should start washing your face with hot water and then finish with cold water this is correct to an extent remember not to use water that is too hot it might cause more inflammation from accidently burning yourself you rinse with the cold water however to make your pores look smaller and your face look less puffy not to actually keep dirt out  Acne Soap Common cold Psoriasis Coffee Rosacea Brewery Pepper spray Water Fire fighting Cleanser Tattoo Dishwasher Solar power Ceramics Hydrotherapy Spark plug Fire Warm-blooded Eczema Sauna Hard water Temperature Sento Carbon dioxide Pebble bed reactor Skin Water (molecule) Porosity Essential oil First aid Shampoo Ammonia Lighting Ice cream Wax play Fecal incontinence Hypothermia Renewable energy Tea Drowning Manicure Charcoal Autonomous building Dry cleaning Heat Dam Glycerin Fire extinguisher Laundry detergent Tire Althaea (genus) Diving suit White phosphorus incendiary Climate of the United Kingdom Ozone depletion Environmental concerns with electricity generation Laundry Hamster Swimming Wood Sterilization (microbiology) Thermal power station Hyperthermia Dairy Hot sauce Detergent Nuclear power Raney nickel Incineration Soldering Scarification Sulfuric acid Carburetor Dishwashing Japanese tea ceremony Egg (food) Titanium Motor oil Tanning Ozone hole Aloe Portland cement Stirling engine Nitroglycerin E85 Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Menstrual cup Ice Urticaria Sulfur Carbon dioxide sink Bread Ocean thermal energy conversion Steel

im my dad is lettin me get my lip or nose pierced i really want to but im kinda scared because it can hurt should i and will it hurt i really want get one like a nose ring or lip ring wich hurts more and im sooo mad bcuz my dad didnt buy me thease fake lip rings and thats why im also getting it and how much will it hurt how much and how long until the hole recoveres o points be happy your dad is giving you the real thing instead of the cheap crap that hardly looks real if being scared of pain is enough to deter you from a piercing then you shouldn't get it all piercings come with some amount of pain even though that pain is usually minimal if you really want a piercing then you'll be willing to go through pain for a very brief period of time so that in the end you'll have the desired result if the pain is enough to turn you off from a piercing then you aren't really sure you want the piercing and you shouldn't get it i was really scared when i went to get my daiths because i thought it was really going to hurt but i was willing to take the pain because taking the pain meant also taking the piercing to directly answer the questions the piercings won't hurt that much they probably have the same pain level it will take months for the piercing to heal remember to clean the piercing with a sea salt solution i also recommend the website bmezine com that site is absolutely devoted to body modification so you'll get a lot better facts and in depth information about piercings there are hundreds of stories devoted to specific piercings so if you want to know the exact piercing procedure of a nose piercing you can read people's in depth experiences about getting pierced  Body piercing Theory of conduct Lip piercing Body modification Scientology beliefs and practices A Course In Miracles Prince Albert piercing Diving Rich Mullins Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tattoo Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Piccolo Junior Saga American Psycho Social rule Penis Theodicy Ear piercing instrument Goodness and value theory Tongue piercing Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Carpal tunnel syndrome Characters of Naruto Humphrey Bogart Utilitarianism The nature of God in Western theology Twelve Swords of Power Microeconomics Neon Genesis Evangelion glossary Nine Inch Nails The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy EastEnders Slayers Surveillance The Amber Spyglass Play piercing Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Jon Secada Daredevil Archery Futurama (TV series - season 5) MapleStory Alcoholics Anonymous The Fairly OddParents Killian documents Spanking Glen Jacobs Drill bit Traumatic brain injury Nipple piercing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Redundant array of independent disks Embedded system Marilyn Monroe Knots Landing Kryptonite Anthroposophy Oral sex Kim Possible Blackjack Wallflower (comics) Methamphetamine Adjoint functors Simone Weil Female genital cutting Guinea pig Springfield Elementary School Massage Joke The Cyberiad Barbell (piercing) Growth hormone treatment Craps Jean Schmidt Sin City Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Identity Crisis (comics) A Day in the Life Professional wrestling holds Electrophysiology Martial art Herpes simplex virus The Shining (film) Pain Terminal ballistics Breastfeeding Calvin and Hobbes Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Epistemology Naruto jutsu Hypnosis Capital punishment Bullet

why do some people have half moon like markings on their fingernails where your skin meets the fingernail some people have a white or light colored half moon or circle some don't and i have them only on my thumbs why is this everyone has half moons on some people they don't show because they are hidden under the cuticle i only have them on my thumbs also if you get in the habit of pushing back the cuticles every time you wash your hands eventually they will stay back and reveal the half moons i just never think about it because i wear nail polish most of the time never push them back with harsh instruments as you can really cause a bad infection that is also very painful the cuticles are a sensitive area of the nail bed  Manicure Nail (anatomy) Hair Milton H.

how do you apply a self tanner i've tried twice and it comes out looking horrible i'm using a gradual self tanner the first time i just applied it as if it were regular lotion to my legs which turned out streaky then i applied it in slow gradual circles same effect any ideas also how do you quickly remove the self tanner exfoliate exfoliate exfoliate take a shower and use those little scrubby exfoliation gloves scrub all over really hard focus on the elbows knees and other rough parts of your body when you get out and dry off your skin will be even and accept the spray better use a self tanner with a tint so you don't go over the same spots more than once that causes streaking stand around until the tanning dries if you get impatient and dress to soon your clothes could rub the spray off on certain areas which will result in blotches  Manicure Psoriasis Aerial (dance move) Soap Mixed martial arts Leather Tanning Wound Sento Puberty Pubic hair Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling aerial techniques Eczema Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Comanche Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Horse Swimming Tai Chi Chuan Massage Breaststroke Sunlight Decompression sickness Woodworking Laws of cricket Sunscreen Hand washing Chair Hyperthermia Equine conformation Fecal incontinence Spanking Diving suit Stomach cancer Pottery Wood Laser hair removal Nudity Physical attractiveness Leopard Scrubs Fire fighting Professional wrestling attacks Marching band Skateboarding trick Ice hockey Bacon Kepler's laws of planetary motion Trousers Barry Bonds Barbie Drill bit Muay Thai Volleyball Boxing Figure skating Human skin color Carbon dioxide Hypothermia Phenol Color theory Childbirth Fencing Tattoo Fast bowling Upholstery Tourniquet Urticaria Urinary incontinence Weathering Pepper spray Professional wrestling throws Japanese tea ceremony Pittsburgh Steelers Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Skunk First aid kit Vitiligo Ultraviolet Shaving Backstroke Tango (dance) Field hockey Paint Scabies Rottweiler Casting Astrodynamics Prostate cancer Cricket Breastfeeding Undergarment Land mine Terminal ballistics Mesothelioma Yosemite National Park Wok Champagne (beverage)

should i cover my acne scars with make up or let them be i have a lot of acne scars on both sides of my cheeks i've been dealing with acne for about years now and now by some miracle it's starting to settle down the only problem is that these old scars don't seem to fade i've been using mederma but i'm not seeing improvements it feels like everyone's looking at my scars when they talk to me should i cover up my acne scars with make up or just leave them alone i have a set of special make up made with teatree oil that's supposed to give a clean cover without blocking pores or making acnes worse but it looks somewhat weird since some of my acne scars left indentations in my skin t t how do i get rid of these lasering away scars really work best answer will be rewarded before committing to any specific method of treatment for your scarring make sure you do a lot of research first every treatment option has pros and cons and every treatment option will improve the appearance of some people s scars while worsening the appearance of others these treatments can also be very expensive which means you need to be very selective about your dermatologist sometimes they re in it for their patients other times they re in it for the money here are some tips to help you pick the right skin doc for you when initially selecting a dermatologist visit several different ones contrast what the different doctors tell you and follow it up with a little research of your own to determine which one is really the best for you beware of doctors that pressure you to commit on the first visit and push new and expensive procedures on you search for the doctors name with quotes in a search engine like google and see what you find if you re not comfortable with any of them move on and keep looking get each doctor to tell you very specifically what course of treatments they would prescribe for your scarring and then get them to explain to you in plain english exactly why they are prescribing that particular course if you think you may forget write it down or bring along a voice recorder follow up their advice with your own research and if you receive opposing treatment plans bring them up to other dermatologists and see how well they respond insist on seeing before and after pictures of their previous patients how many of the people in the before pictures have scarring that resembles yours can you contact any of these people how long have they been practicing dermatologists what treatments do they have experience prescribing and performing there is certainly no shortage of creams and balms that claim to cure everything from impotence to scarring but do they work creams containing cocoa butter and vitamin e help keep your skin soft elastic and healthy regular use of such creams may help scars diminish naturally over time i would recommend combining this with an overall healthy lifestyle apply a x solution of medical grade hydrofluoric acid or a product which contains it to the scarred area twice daily for one to two weeks do this only under the supervision of your dermatologist because this can damage your skin best of luck babe and remember don't try to cure his is cheap stuff from stores i doubt any of them work so save up some cash or whatever you need to do and go visit a good dermatologist so he can help you with that  Fecal incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Eczema Dermatology Cancer Homeopathy Baldness treatments Radiation therapy Malignant melanoma Chronic fatigue syndrome Pneumonia Urinary incontinence A Course In Miracles Rosacea Chocolate Stuttering Breastfeeding Expert system Multiple sclerosis Skin Tocopherol Migraine Isotretinoin Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cirrhosis Transsexuality Theory of conduct Bipolar disorder Microeconomics Herpes simplex virus Medical analysis of circumcision Lupus erythematosus Autism Scientology beliefs and practices Insomnia Nutrition Quackery Antidepressant Tuberculosis Milk Smallpox Physical therapy Church of Christ, Scientist Gastroesophageal reflux disease Fibromyalgia Osteoarthritis Dialysis Psychiatric hospital Clinical depression Dairy Retinol Medical prescription Ultraviolet Graduate school Chlorpromazine Diabetes mellitus Milton H.

can i get some shaving tips for shaving my legs i'll need like step by step instructions because i'm really confused and my mom doesn't teach me these kinds of things here are some tips for shaving your legs do it during or right after a warm shower so the pores that have the hair follicles are larger remember the barbers use warm towels for that very reason use something to make the skin smoother such as special shaving foam or gel or just soap bubbles use a high quality razor that is in good shape it does not have to be the most expensive but it has to be in perfect condition prepare your razor by running warm or hot water before starting before starting comb the hair with your hand and see how the hair grows apply the gel or foam following the hair growth lines follow the hair growth line when using the razor if you do not do it you may get ingrown hairs they look like bumps and they can be painful many women shave doing the exact opposite it gives a closer shave if it works for you that is fine but it is not the best method for women with sensitive skin also if you get frequent ingrown hair follow our advice after shaving rinse with colder water you do not have to freeze but colder than the one you used in the beginning of your shower preferably you should use some cream without fragrance or color after shaving let it dry before getting dressed good luck  Shaving Pubic hair Sento Hair Razor Manicure Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Depilation Baldness Haircut Pseudofolliculitis barbae Leg shaving Menstrual cup Beard Coffee Waxing Psoriasis Tofu Violin Soap Shampoo Acne Brewery Casting Textile manufacturing Diving suit Volleyball Customs and etiquette of Japan Japanese tea ceremony Knife Leather Wood Tarantula Fecal incontinence Skin Wound Gay bathhouse Puberty Comanche First aid Stage lighting Upholstery Leaf Laser hair removal Nitroglycerin Hyperthermia Breastfeeding Global Gillette Baldness treatments Nail (anatomy) Swimming pool Sauna Chlorophyta Head shaving Agarose gel electrophoresis Chinchilla Embalming Dreadlocks Fluoride therapy Cannabis cultivation Skinhead Mattress Aloe Dialysis Tea Swimming Sewage treatment Happy Tree Friends Social rule Toilet paper Car washing techniques Eczema Hard water Scar The Legend of Zelda series enemies Saxophone Towel Cell (biology) Prostate cancer Malignant melanoma Massage Tanning Brush Instant coffee Katana Hasidic Judaism Dry cleaning Condom Dairy 613 mitzvot Dog Hair color Boil Occam's Razor Physical attractiveness

help with the hair down there ladies onlyy should i wax or should i use nair the bikini creme i can decide because i heard that if you wax you get ingrown hairs help me please okayy no answers like why would you do that or omg thats soo wrong your not in my position and im not going to get rid of all of it nair may irritate your bikini area and shaving will produce short lasting results and can be pretty painful waxing is your best option with the best results for the first time go to a professional so you can get a basic understanding of how it works but after that you can do it yourself that's what i did unlike what most people say it's not even painful especially after you get used to it and the results are great say goodbye to bikini hair for up to weeks after waxing for a while the bikini hairs appear less frequently and you will see that the hair becomes thinner and less of it comes back i have been waxing myself for a year now and i definately recomend it  Waxing Depilation Pubic hair Brazilian waxing Swimsuit Bikini Guinea pig Kodocha Haircut Prostate cancer Leg shaving Hair Pseudofolliculitis barbae Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Nair Three Stooges Shaving Theory of conduct Phonograph cylinder Cross-country skiing Singlish Ski wax Baldness Moustache Tarantula Laser hair removal Beard Callus Wax Grief Puberty Otitis externa Psoriasis Undergarment Jacqueline Moore Swimming Carpal tunnel syndrome Human sexual behavior Androgen insensitivity syndrome BASIC programming language Alexander Technique Professional wrestling match types Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Kurt Angle Hair metal What's My Line?

has anyone ever used maui babe browning lotion does it actually work i bought it yesterday and i was wondering how you use it no duh you have to rub it in your body but like how long until you can get into water after use is there any place on the body you shouldn't use it thanks a zillion my wife got and used some when we were in hawaii a few years ago it has some kind of ingredient smells like cinamon and brown sugar that is supposed to help your skin become browner with exposure to the sun i don't know if the stuff worked but it is very sticky and you'll smell like a cinamon roll for a couple of days it's probably not worth the money since we didn't really notice any results it's got an oil base so it doesn't readily wash off in the water and it seemed to be all natural ingredients so i don't think it will hurt to use it anyplace sensitive on your body like anything though avoid getting it in your eyes it might burn or sting a bit  Sunscreen Sushi Maui Hamster Eczema Massage Shark Sunlight Mosquito Shampoo Spider Tarantula Social rule Formic acid George Burns Perfume Ammonia Hay fever Leather Potato Smoke-screen Jellyfish Diving suit Pok__mon Abilities Shaggy dog story Tocopherol Obsessive-compulsive disorder Tattoo Soap Acne Shit Sin City Babe Ruth Psoriasis Breakfast Sperm Whale Diving Aloe Tofu Surveillance Hydrogen sulfide Manicure Human skin color Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Japanese cuisine Sauna Aerial (dance move) Scabies Phoebe Buffay's songs Neighbours Kurt Cobain Ultraviolet Rice pudding Rice Solvent Dandruff Piccolo Junior Saga Microeconomics Milton H.

whats the best product for acne prescription medications for treating acne a variety of prescription medications are used today to clear acne topical applied to the skin medications may be prescribed for mild to severe acne systemic works internally therapy is needed to treat severe acne and may be used for moderate cases these medications which play an important role in acne treatment attack the different factors that lead to acne to achieve long term control and resolution dermatologists may combine therapies the following describes the prescription medications used in the united states to treat acne interlesional corticosteroid injection when an acne cyst becomes severely inflamed there is a good chance that it will rupture and scarring may result to treat these severely inflamed cysts and prevent scarring dermatologists may inject such cysts with a much diluted corticosteroid this lessens the inflammation and promotes healing an interlesional corticosteroid injection works by melting the cyst over a period of to days isotretinoin isotretinoin is a potent oral retinoid that is reserved for treatment of very severe cystic acne and severe acne that has proven itself resistant to other medications for more information about isotretinoin see treating severe acne oral antibiotics for patients with moderate to severe and persistent acne oral antibiotics have been a mainstay of therapy for years like topical antimicrobials oral antibiotics work to reduce the p acnes population a contributing factor in acne which in turn decreases inflammation treatment with oral antibiotics usually begins with a higher dosage which is reduced as acne resolves generally antibiotics are prescribed for six months or less over time the p acnes bacteria can become resistant to the antibiotic being used to treat it when resistance occurs acne is no longer controlled another antibiotic or alternative treatment can be prescribed numerous studies support the effectiveness of the following oral broad spectrum antibiotics which are used to treat acne in the united states erythromycin it is effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria including p acnes the most common side effect is irritation of the gastrointestinal tract tetracycline and derivatives tetracyclines reduce the papules and pustules inflammatory lesions of acne these medications should not be taken by children younger than years of age because they can affect growth and stain teeth they should also not be taken by a woman who is pregnant or breast feeding during pregnancy and breastfeeding tetracyclines can affect the development of the child s bones and teeth leading to skeletal defects a typical tetracycline regimen for treating moderate to severe acne starts with a dose of to milligrams a day which is decreased as improvement occurs long term low dose tetracycline therapy may be continued for many months to suppress acne higher doses may be prescribed for very severe acne two synthetic derivatives of tetracycline used to treat acne are doxycycline and minocycline doxycycline proves especially effective in treating inflammatory acne it can cause sun sensitivity in some patients minocyline has a long history of use in treating acne it is often effective in treating acne that has not responded to other oral antibiotics minocycline also seems to produce fewer incidents of antibiotic resistance oral contraceptives oral contraceptives have been shown to effectively clear acne in women by suppressing the overactive sebaceous glands and can be used as long term acne therapy however oral contraceptives should not be prescribed to women who smoke have a blood clotting disorder are older than or have a history of migraine headaches without the advice of a gynecologist topical antimicrobials topical antimicrobials work to inhibit the p acnes populations and are used to treat patients with mild to moderately severe inflammatory acne they may be used alone or combined with a medication that works on another factor that leads to acne aside from p acnes a dermatologist can determine whether a topical antimicrobial is appropriate for a patient and if so which topical antimicrobial should be prescribed prescription topical antimicrobials used to treat acne vulgaris in the united states include azelaic acid naturally occurring in the skin azelaic acid is used to treat mild to moderate inflammatory and non inflammatory acne it is believed that azelaic acid clears acne by reducing the populations of p acnes decreasing the abnormal shedding of skin cells and reducing inflammation this medication has also proven effective in treating the dark spots that develop in some acne patients with skin of color azaleic acid is well tolerated by most people and can be safely used for years side effects may include skin dryness and lightening of the skin where applied benzoyl peroxide benzoyl peroxide works by killing p acnes however it does not have anti inflammatory abilities it is available in a wide range of strengths and can be found as a gel lotion cleanser cream and wash many acne preparations include benzoyl peroxide because research shows that benzoyl peroxide increases the effectiveness of some medicines such as erythromycin and clindamycin when used in combination with antibiotics benzoyl peroxide also reduces the likelihood of a patient developing resistance to the antibiotic the most common side effects are skin irritation the potential to bleach hair and fabrics as well as possible allergic reaction clindamycin a semi synthetic antibiotic topical clindamycin has a long history of successfully treating acne it works by reducing p acnes and decreasing inflammation in topical form clindamycin has proven safe and is well tolerated skin dryness and irritation are possible side effects it is important to use as directed to decrease bacterial resistance that can occur with antibiotic use erythromycin this topical antibiotic is active against a broad spectrum of bacteria including p acnes topical erythromycin which is an antimicrobial and anti inflammatory is used primarily to treat acne when topical erthyromycin is combined with benzoyl peroxide the combination proves to be quite effective as the patient gets the effects of two antimicrobial agents like topical clindamycin erythromycin may cause skin dryness and possible irritation it is important to use as directed to decrease bacterial resistance that can occur with antibiotic use sodium sulfacetamide a topical antibiotic that inhibits p acnes and opens clogged pores sodium sulfacetamide is effective in treating inflammatory acne many products containing sodium sulfacetamide include sulfur some patients do not like the smell of the sulfur or its grittiness usually the newer products that contain sulfur do not have these problems topical retinoids prescribed to treat acne ranging from mild to moderately severe topical retinoids are a derivative of vitamin a and considered a cornerstone in acne treatment retinoids work to unclog pores and prevent whiteheads and blackheads from forming topical retinoids can irritate the skin and increase sun sensitivity so it is important to use sun protection and follow the dermatologist s directions to maximize effectiveness an added benefit in using topical retinoids is that they may help diminish the signs of aging such as fine lines and wrinkles topical retinoids currently prescribed for acne treatment in the united states include adapalene a synthetic retinoid applied as a gel or cream adapalene unclogs pores and possesses moderate to potent anti inflammatory abilities improvement is usually seen in to weeks side effects include minor skin irritation and dryness tazarotene a synthetic retinoid available as a gel or cream it works to keep the skin s pores clear and has proven effective in treating acne this medication should not be used by women who are pregnant and effective contraception is needed while taking tazarotene because the medication has produced birth defects in animals skin irritation is a possible side effect tretinoin the first retinoid developed for topical use tretinoin is a natural retinoid it works to gradually unclog pores and keep them unplugged in the past many patients found tretinoin too harsh for their skin however the newer forms are proving less irritating side effects include redness scaling dryness itching and burning if these occur talk with the dermatologist who prescribed tretinoin as these side effects can be managed by adjusting the amount applied and when it is applied reference thiboutot d new treatments and therapeutic strategies for acne archives of family medicine

hey i need your help i have recently gotten my belly button pierced it is healing fine i just have one small problem i tan in a tanning bed which causes my skin to become somewhat dry my skin around my piercing is beginning to look like it could peel i clean it often but my question is is there any product that i can put on my piercing to moisturize the area without interferring with the healing process such as vaseline aloe gel nonscented lotion or neosporin don't use vaseline or petroleum based products this traps bacteria and creates a breeding ground for infection use straight up vitamin e gel get it from the health food store aloe is fine too and clean your piercing with bactine or betadyne no alcohol or peroxide and avoid liquid soaps because they contain more glycerine which can be drying for the skin good luck stay healthy  Aloe Body piercing Psoriasis Shaving Glycerin Acne Eczema Halitosis Tofu Hemp Skin Fecal incontinence Hydrogen peroxide Hamster Manicure Food preservation Stomach cancer Antiseptic Tattoo Sunburn Biodiesel Fancy rat Wound healing phases Dry cleaning Sunlight Vitamin D Soap Tocopherol Zinc Herpes simplex virus Earring Personal lubricant Cheese Shampoo Milk Nitroglycerin Anthrax Escherichia coli O157:H7 Gelatin E number Scar Vermicompost Domestic rabbit Vitamin Gout Ultraviolet Dandruff Nipple piercing Food Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Veganism Dairy Potato Pneumonia Knife Ethanol Nutrition Urinary incontinence Tlingit Anal sex Guinea pig Polyethylene terephthalate Homeopathy Benzoyl peroxide Acetic acid Dietary fiber Breastfeeding Otitis externa Fire extinguisher Fluoride therapy Peanut Hand washing Cancer Chocolate Menstrual cup Date Palm Bedbug Bacon Disinfection Prostate cancer Traumatic brain injury Folic acid Swimming Crohn's disease Cirrhosis Polymerase chain reaction Vinegar Lactobacillus acidophilus Foodborne illness Riboflavin Coffee Water Diseases of the honeybee Scabies Comfrey

whats a good way to get rid of zits before school starts hi i have like a million zits and its so annoying my registration picture day is the of august i need to have a clear face by then i would also like to keep up with having clear skin so if you can help that would be great thank you so much tempting as it is don't try to pop the pimple by squeezing pinching or picking at it this will just inflame the pore and spread the oils that caused the pimple apply ice to the area for minutes every half hour this will help shrink the pimple and possibly reduce it to an invisible size apply a flesh tinted acne medication that contains benzoyl peroxide salicylic acid or sulfur since these medications dry out the skin apply only to the pimple area if you'd like use an oil free powder to cover up the medicated area and reduce any shine if the pimple is already coming to a head and it's too late to use the ice treatment use heat wash the area with soap and water apply a hot damp compress to the pimple for seconds this increases circulation and helps bring the pimple to a head remove the compress and apply gentle pressure to drain the pimple do not squeeze if the pimple does not drain reapply heat and try again do not force the pimple to drain wash the area with soap and water after pimple drains here are some kitchen spot treatment cut a clove of garlic in half and no kidding dab on your pimple once or twice a day garlic kills bacteria and also kills pimples mix a teaspoon of red wine vinegar into a cup of water and dab on spot blemishes but not on open pimples place a thin slice of potato on the pimple at bedtime secure it with a band aid and remove it in the morning cover a blemish with a dab of honey place a band aid over it and it will be gone by morning goodluck  Vinegar Tofu Psoriasis Dairy Carbon dioxide Tea Sulfuric acid Tattoo Eczema Jewish cuisine Massage Halitosis Chili con carne Thermal power station Urinary incontinence Sewage treatment Hydrogen peroxide Gilding Cuisine of the Philippines Sento Professional wrestling holds Sterilization (microbiology) Mouth ulcer Casting Fecal incontinence Hyperthermia Wound Menstrual cup Rosacea Botulism Diving suit Bread Common cold Fossil fuel power plant Garlic Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Food preservation Water purification Sulfur Wood Drill bit Diseases of the honeybee Knife Hindenburg disaster Potato Milk Japanese cuisine Kosher foods Mosquito Cleanser Dialysis Cocaine Bengali cuisine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dry cleaning Champagne (beverage) Traumatic brain injury Soap Fire extinguisher Coffee Wart Scar Intracranial pressure Intravenous therapy Manicure Internal combustion engine Agar plate Cantonese cuisine 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Skin Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Brewery Haggis Bacteria Rice Cuisine of Denmark Sugar Glass Transformer Cheese Rice pudding Benzoyl peroxide Aloe Keloid 1957 World Series German cuisine Insulin Fire fighting Internal ballistics

what is your beauty regimen i'm starting university this fall and i want beautiful skin a fresh start what is your beauty regimen first drink lots of water when your body is even slightly hydrated the first place it takes water from is the outer layer of skin this can make the difference between having glowing skin and dull skin i drink at least cups a day and i notice if i go a day without drinking much water my skin looks noticeably drier if you work out you will need more i have always used the clinique step system and it works great not too harsh and it can be customized to your skin type however you don't necessarily have to buy the clinique system per se just remember three steps cleanse exfoliate tone moisturize always start with a mild facial cleanser clinique or try cetaphil which cleanses without irritation or dryness next use an exfoliating toner like clinique clarifying lotion or try neutrogena pore refinining toner follow with an oil free gentle moisturizer that is formulated for your skin type if your skin is oily try a light gel moisturizer most importantly listen to your skin i usually do three steps in morning and evening however if my skin seems dry in the morning i will skip the toner and just cleanse and moisturize or if my skin is oily i will just cleanse and tone you get the idea try different products and methods and see what works best for you be gentle limit the harsh scrubs to once a week and use sunblock if you must scrub use a soft cloth and gently buff skin to remove makeup and dead skin that can dull the only exception is if you have acne that is more than just a few pimples once in a while i get acne sometimes still its hormones but if acne is more severe you may have to try something stronger to treat it otherwise it always pays to be kind to your skin sorry to go on so long hope this helps  Psoriasis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tofu Fecal incontinence Rosacea Shampoo Soap Wood Cosmetics Urinary incontinence Skin Moisturizer Shaving Manicure Tattoo Weathering Dry cleaning Sunscreen Radiation therapy Eczema Androgen insensitivity syndrome Explosive material Upholstery Dialysis Hemp Sunburn Rice Sento Knife Ultraviolet Aloe Cancer Testosterone Diaper Cheese Body piercing Puberty Urticaria Dietary fiber Breast cancer Scar Massage Coffee Brewery Fasting Smoke-screen Dairy Scarification Herpes simplex virus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hamster Hypoglycemia Menstrual cup Glycerin Chocolate Social rule Hiking Mouth ulcer Champagne (beverage) Portland cement Embalming Milk Onion Dehydration Antiseptic Prostate cancer Bong Sulfuric acid Keratosis pilaris Polyethylene terephthalate Weather lore Human skin color Smegma Polycystic ovary syndrome Personal lubricant Antiretroviral drug Hydrogen peroxide 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Customs and etiquette of Japan Mummy Otitis externa Clothing Scabies Keloid First aid Baldness treatments Tenjiku shogi

people with cartlidge piercings i got the cartlidge of my ear pierced about a year ago but it is still swollen and sore i don't have or time to see a doctor so i really need your help what is wrong and what can i do to stop it next question i used to have my nose pierced with a needle i let it grow back when i lost my gold nose ring is it safe to re pierce over scar tissue i had my upper ear pierced in highschool and when i thought it was healed i quit cleaning it as i should have and it became infected with pussy stuff and a hard bump in the back part of my problem was that i stopped cleaning it but it was also because my ear had been pierced with a gun at claires not with a needle by a professional which makes cartilidge piercings more prone to infection and swelling because the gun can shatter the cartilidge rather than only pierce it also because it was done at claires i had a post in it and not a ring here's what i did i took out the post and immediately put in a surgical steel ring that was a thin gage the post was collecting the puss and stuff behind the backing and the backing was also putting pressure on the bump not good then i was religous about cleaning my ear a couple times a day i would take the ring out clean the spot really well with antibacterial soap put a small dab of neosporin on both sides of my ear washed the ring real well and put it back in then slid the ring back and forth in the piercing a few times and left it alone not touching at all til i cleaned it again sometimes i put iodine on it after washing and let it sit for a few seconds then washed it again and so on it was months before my ear fully healed but it was not that hard of a routine and i saved the piercing but as one of the other answers said maybe you have an allergy to metal make sure it's a surgical steel ring bar the next piercing i made sure i had it done with a needle and ring right off the bat and cleaned it as long as he told me i was supposed to clean it and i had no problems or pain at all i hope you heal well  Earring Tattoo Ear piercing instrument Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Violin Professional wrestling holds Acne Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Penis Textile manufacturing Prince Albert piercing Skin Suture Medicine Sin City First aid The Inside Drill bit Nipple piercing Stomach cancer Menstrual cup Wound Hip fracture Condom Methamphetamine Babe Ruth Equine conformation Diving Scarification Dialysis Keloid Sento Radiation therapy Volleyball Knife The Empty Child Tongue piercing Shaggy dog story Tuberculosis Breastfeeding Hepatitis C Antiseptic Carpal tunnel syndrome Social rule Skateboarding trick Urinary incontinence Allergy Knots Landing Ebola Massage Eddie Guerrero Otitis externa Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Mosquito Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Play piercing Mattress The Contender (television series) Prostate cancer Neighbours Upholstery Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Herpes simplex virus Piccolo Junior Saga Humphrey Bogart Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Professional wrestling match types Time Out of Mind 2000 Australian Grand Prix Phimosis Coeliac disease Group A streptococcal infection Barbell (piercing) Naruto jutsu Domestic rabbit Body modification Professional wrestling attacks Adjustable gastric band Ric Flair Childbirth Chronic fatigue syndrome YuYu Hakusho Jala neti Otitis media Vegeta Tenshinhan Strap-on dildo Fecal incontinence

double tongue piercing can anyone please tell me if it's true that you get a lisp from having two tongue piercings or even one i am aware of the other risks and issues i'm just wondering about this specific thing thanks does anyone who has a double tongue piercing have any tips for me i'm thinking of getting one soon p i am a body piercer and you can get a double tongue piercing if your tongue is long enough it doesn't cause a lisp although at first it might seem so because you have to have a larger tongue bar in to accomodate for swelling and this can sometimes cause a bit of a lisp but it goes away after four or five days and once you get a smaller tongue bar put in there should be no problem one question tho do you have your first piercing yet as you will not be able to get both at once you'll need at least weeks between both and you will need to keep your longer bar from first time around to wear in the first piercing when you get the second one anyway i've had my tongue pierced and i never had any lisp at all this is something that rarely happens and is only due to a bit of swelling if you do get a lisp it is definately not permanentl and will last days max happy piercing  Body piercing Tongue piercing Lisp programming language Earring Traumatic brain injury Common Lisp Drill bit Ear piercing instrument Stuttering Penis Computer numbering formats Nipple piercing Navel piercing Variable Oral sex Cat Social rule Franklin Pierce Vowel Group A streptococcal infection Dylan programming language Barbell (piercing) Condom Lambda calculus Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Prince Albert piercing Vampire Intravenous therapy Terminal ballistics New Morning XML Programming language Non-native pronunciations of English Python programming language Spider American Psycho Old Tongue M16 (rifle) Sesotho language Archery Scheme programming language Floppy disk Lip piercing Object-oriented programming Double bass Tattoo F.

how long do you have to wait untill you can change a eye brow ring and put a clear one in as soon as its healed good indication of that is if its not sore to touch we all heal at different rates some quicker or slower than others so there is no specific time limit just be aware that you may get some allergic reactions to certain materials if this should occur it usually becomes itchy or infected within a few days if this happens remove it immediately if you are not comfortable replacing your new eyebrow jewelry go to the peircer who performed the peircing and they will change it for you if you are doing it yourself make sure you have washed your hands the new jewelry is sterilised and that you use whitch hazel or antiseptic lubricant on the jewelry to avoid snagging and a smooth transition good luck  Body piercing Tattoo Hay fever Earring Psoriasis Eczema Allergy Herpes simplex virus Condom Conjunctivitis Sterilization (microbiology) Common cold Jewellery Antiseptic Baseball Eye Bone fracture Casting Barbell (piercing) Coeliac disease Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hygiene E85 Mouth ulcer Benzene Welding Cornea transplant Diamond Violin Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Asthma Scabies Upholstery Prince Albert piercing Wood Cytomegalovirus Refractive surgery Intersex surgery Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Salute Marathon (sport) Skin Betting (poker) First aid Stuttering Massage Social rule Traumatic brain injury Diamond cut Father's Day (Doctor Who) Dynamic random access memory Anus CPU cache Speed of light Dialysis Milton H.

do pro active skin care products work well and hav lasting result i know its kinda random p nope doesn't work it either has no effect on your skin at all or it works but once you stop using it you break out like crazy again or it becomes worse proactiv contains soap which causes it to dry out your skin with your skin producing more oils to compensate for the oil loss in the end your skin will become both dry and oily which is just kinda sick using soap on your skin also will age your skin and make you look older in no time i say you just ditch the idea of using proactiv and start researching for other good facial products i recommend dr pierre products http www pierrechenxu com i swear by it and so does everyone else using it read their testimonies  Dandruff Cleanser Eczema Soap Aloe Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fecal incontinence Shaving Puberty Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Baldness treatments Soap opera Prostate cancer Oily fish Dry cleaning Shampoo Chlorpromazine Procter & Gamble Sulfuric acid Radiation therapy Tocopherol Glycerin Clinical depression Leather Smoke-screen Essential oil Moisturizer Tattoo Yarrow Transformer Carbon dioxide Gross domestic product Manicure Diabetes mellitus Diving suit Mosquito Menstrual cup Vitamin D Wound healing phases Creosote Tuberculosis Scar Scarification Microeconomics Culture jamming Cancer Animal testing Wok Atkins Nutritional Approach H2G2 Olive oil Tofu First aid Physical attractiveness Urinary incontinence Razor Kasparov versus The World Aromatherapy Palm oil Flax Knots Landing Wound Skin Testosterone Electronic commerce World Wide Web Human skin color Anthrax Randomness Body piercing Omega-3 fatty acid Friends Medicine Surveillance Transmission Control Protocol Bacon Methamphetamine Diseconomies of scale Biodiesel Carl Barks Pepper spray Superman: The Movie Fire fighting Yugo Sperm Whale Roswell UFO incident Oral contraceptive Childbirth Spyware Hillary Rodham Clinton Evidence-based medicine Spina bifida Lupus erythematosus SOAP Decompression sickness Keynesian economics EastEnders

how can you hide hickies i heard that you can freeze a spoon or toothpaste might work don't tell me to use make up turtle necks comb my hair over it or not to do it at all apparently i know that lol but things happen anyways if you know if the spoon thing or toothpaste works or something like that works let me know thanks hickies are bruises so u need to ice them if you catch the hickey soon enough your can minimize the mark by immediately applying ice surface stimulation will help disperse the blood gently rub and massage the area using a comb or a hairbrush to massage the area works better than fingers and hands using any tubular object with a domed end apply steady pressure over the hickey and twist it will hurt but it will help lipstick caps pen caps and blistex caps work the goal is to work the blood deeper into the skin make the hickey worse if you use a curling iron have your friend reshape the hickey to match the pattern that it would make if you had burned yourself accidentally this can work with any likely burn or bruise scenario do not burn yourself reshape the hickey with more suction utilize turtleneck sweaters scarves or makeup to cover it up rub vitamin k into the area apply a warm moist used tea bag as a hot compress repeatedly re wet and re warm it as needed until the hickey disappears i copied it from a website so sorry about the turtleneck stuff  Salad Fingers Breastfeeding Diving Happy Tree Friends Bong Tattoo Casting Carbon dioxide Internal ballistics Carnivorous plant Tea Vitamin C Water Aloe Ice core Sento Shampoo Textile manufacturing Drowning Professional wrestling match types Professional wrestling holds Magic (illusion) Tire Erogenous zone Carpal tunnel syndrome The Shining (film) First aid Violin Cocaine Motor oil Fountain pen Knife Brush Professional wrestling slang Reflexology Acne Aerial (dance move) Dialysis Pervertible Embalming Manicure Airsoft The Inside Urinary incontinence Laserdisc Bleeding Shaggy dog story Electrophysiology Campfire Diving suit Comanche Columbine High School massacre Naruto jutsu Thermoregulation Cannabis (drug) Stomach cancer Tlingit Blood on the Tracks Diseases of the honeybee Traumatic brain injury Lake Glossary of climbing terms Plastic Blood (computer game) Tobacco Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hyperthermia Jet engine Basic English Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner Chopsticks Triage Skin Drawing Terminal ballistics Welding Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards Mouth ulcer Harmonica Brian Close Dreadlocks Ice age Items in the Metroid series Pressure point Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Tooth Callus Milton H.

what are your favorite products for treating acne i have used a brand of cream called acnefree terminator which i found in the drug store and it comes in an orange tube it is really effective because it is stronger than most others benzoyl peroxide and is time released so it keeps working long after you put it on when i use it regularly it will get rid of zits in only a couple of days i have also used both aveeno brand and clean clear brand of foaming cleanser to wash my face every day that seems to help too because they contain small percentages of salicylic acid which also treats acne  Acne Benzoyl peroxide Psoriasis Isotretinoin Chocolate Rosacea Hydrogen peroxide Wart Tattoo Vinegar Dairy Cleanser Aspirin Salicylic acid Crohn's disease E number Antiseptic Ice cream Coffee Minoxidil Mattress Olive oil Scar Paracetamol Acetone peroxide Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Haloalkane Milk Flour Cathode ray tube Fecal incontinence Sterilization (microbiology) Retinol Genital wart Rooibos Sulfuric acid Soft drink Shampoo Puberty Sunscreen Citric acid Prostate cancer Guinea pig Folic acid Athlete's foot Strap-on dildo Common cold Yarrow Androgen insensitivity syndrome Dandruff Artemisinin Fibromyalgia First aid Urinary incontinence Eflornithine Dairy Queen Anthrax Dialysis Pond's Creams Cocaine Allergy Pharmaceutical company Amineptine Anabolic steroid Babe Ruth Egg white Alcoholic beverage Genericized trademark Hydrochloric acid Hoffmann-La Roche Alzheimer's disease Water (molecule) Diarrhea Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Tofu Textile manufacturing Soap Vodka Menstrual cup Cheese Mouth ulcer Vitamin Toothpaste Botulin toxin Lightstick Gastroparesis Pringles Agricultural wastewater treatment Casting Donovan Procter & Gamble Radical polymerization Vitamin C Acid Methylphenidate Plastic

eyebrow piercing i got my eyebrow pierced in may and i believe its infected its tender still and hurts sometimes what do i do to heal it as apparently it was never fully healed in the first place if its infection which im sure it is how do i get rid of it it has pretty much been tender ever since because of the dirt which gets into eyebrow piercings movement and the amount of hair follicles near the wound eyebrow piercings are prone to infections you must be diligent with cleaning to prevent infections however if an infection does occur it can turn nasty very quickly because there is no tissue under the skin of the eyebrow the infection can quickly turn into a large cyst the area of the piercing can become very red and tender and there can be a large amount of discharge from the wound the easiest method to remove infection from the wound is the application of a hot compress get a clean hand towel or paper towel and hold it under very hot running water test the heat of the compress so that you can just bear the heat on the wound be careful not to apply it when it's too hot as this can result in a bad burn hold the hot compress on the wound until you feel the heat dissipate altogether remove the compress and gently bathe the wound with warm salty water don't squeeze the piercing to remove any infection just apply very gentle pressure with a clean tissue repeat the hot compress a couple of more times until all residue is removed from the wound follow this process twice a day until the wound settles down if this doesn't alleviate the infection you will have to see a doctor for antibiotics the doctor may tell you to remove the ring don't do this as the jewelery allows any exudate to come out of the wound if you remove it there will be no way of allowing the pus out of the wound if antibiotics fail to stop the infection you have no choice but to remove the ring however in my experience this is very rare hope it helps  Tattoo Body piercing Acne First aid Urinary incontinence Massage Common cold Wound Sauna Group A streptococcal infection Welding Prostate cancer Psoriasis Earring Eczema Boil Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Manicure Wound healing phases Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Energy development Sewage treatment Dialysis Menstrual cup Scar Cellulitis Intravenous therapy Inflammation Sento Breastfeeding Terminal ballistics Brewery Abscess Stomach cancer Transformer Hyperthermia Sterilization (microbiology) Fecal incontinence Allergy Rosacea Eye Hydrogen economy Internal ballistics Movie projector Bone fracture Bleeding Dairy Electrophysiology Carpal tunnel syndrome Keloid Fire fighting Escherichia coli O157:H7 Chronic fatigue syndrome Carbon dioxide Domestic rabbit Diseases of the honeybee Menstrual cycle Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jet engine Snake Ear piercing instrument Billboard Hot 100 Nuclear fallout Tesla coil Professional wrestling holds Gonorrhoea Traditional Chinese medicine Puberty Medical analysis of circumcision Scarification Violin Chinchilla Condom Anthrax Chalazion Staphylococcus aureus Strap-on dildo Agar plate Spacecraft propulsion Spark plug Pharyngitis Fusion power Conjunctivitis Axial compressor Seismic retrofit Survival skills Pneumonia Foodborne illness

how to make fingernails become strong i have been a nail biter most of my life and everytime i try and grow them they are weak soft and break all the time any ideas don't use nail polish because that means using nail polish remover and think about it nail polish and the remover have to contain strong enough chemicals to adhere to your nails and then strip more chemicals from your nails plus it dries out your skin moisturize them with lotion or olive oil just do a mask whenever you remember it's important that they stay moisturized because think of what happens when skin isn't it gets brittle and flaky avoid washing your hands too much or doing dishes wear gloves while washing and cleaning also moisturize after showering etc soon your nails will be strong white and healthy  Manicure Eczema Nail (anatomy) Upholstery Knife Leather Psoriasis Soap Rice Shampoo Urinary incontinence Pedicure Tofu Solvent Acne Textile manufacturing Hand washing Wound Cosmetics Certified Nursing Assistant Social rule Sulfuric acid Hygiene Drill bit Horseshoe Dishwasher Wood Stomach cancer Durian Moisturizer Gelatin Jute Diaper Diving suit Urticaria Cheese Smoke-screen Pottery Vlad III Dracula Menstrual cup Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaving Hard water Hamster Earwax Foodborne illness Smegma Seismic retrofit Skin Domesticated turkey Happy Tree Friends Acetone Gilding Ringworm Towel Carbon dioxide Tea Tattoo Callus Polyethylene terephthalate Dandruff Pepper spray Nine Inch Nails Customs and etiquette of Japan Scabies Water Pubic hair Eastern Orthodox Church Ultraviolet Clothing Tanning Tire Ethyl acetate Glycerin Washing machine Houseplant Thermal power station Bacon Anemia Bong Alopecia areata Dishwashing Glove Toilet paper Tooth enamel Crucifixion Weathering Sword making Milton H.

is it norml for aging skin on a woman to start to get larger pores and if so what helps that my mom wants to know thanks guess ur mom at her age is experiencing oily complexion on the skin's surface but dry inside it's normal for her skincare regime use a soap free cleanser how to tell ur using a cleanser that is suitable for u results after cleansing skin should feel soft and not tight stretched or itchy use a toner that is alcohol free to further remove traces of dirt and always remember to remove all traces of make up with a gentle and effective make up remover as for make up always always prep skin by using a moisturiser that is oil free and has spf to block uv rays for the face also use a eye balm to moisturise the delicate eye area lastly use a primer it is especially good for shrinking pores and control oil and ensures even foundation application later remember that contrary to most beliefs a good moisturiser does help to even out sebum production and not add oil to the face this is because when our skin is dry the skin automatically produces more oil which results in extra sebum lastly to give the illusion of smaller pores use a liquid foundation which can contain skin good vitamins than powder foundation which can look cakey liquid ones also contain light reflecting pigments to give a dewy and radiant complexion apply the foundation only where necessary like the t zone never put too much foundation on older women unless ur mom wanna look like the ge tais the trick to looking good is to show off skin and not cover up under thick layers of powder finish up with a light dust of loose powder blusher for a rosy complexion and a creamy lipcolor with shine for that added oomph for fuller lips if she is attending dinner or functions to further boost the skin a trick is to use a mask to tighten pores for taut skin to ensure a smooth make up application hope the above helps  Cleanser Acne Skin Tattoo Psoriasis Eczema Fecal incontinence Ultraviolet Tofu Soap Drill bit Cosmetics Shampoo Brewery Knife Mattress Wood Paint Aluminium Upholstery Carbon dioxide Transformer Leather Casting Internal ballistics Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fire extinguisher Pottery Sewage treatment Dry cleaning Leaf Glass Thermal power station Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Handloading Corrosion Manicure Sunscreen Puberty Hydrochloric acid Hamster Human skin color Sento Poker jargon Sulfuric acid Champagne (beverage) Explosive material Coffee Tobacco Hair Physical attractiveness Scar Nuclear explosion Sebaceous gland Ceramics Textile manufacturing Smoke-screen Essential oil Terminal ballistics Lip balm Drawing Milk Cracking (chemistry) Laser Glycerin Violin Shaving Dairy Seismic retrofit Dialysis Floppy disk Sand casting Welding Mosquito M16 (rifle) Tire The Legend of Zelda series enemies Cartridge (firearms) Tocopherol Ice core Stereoscopy Hemp Plastic Laser engraving Tesla coil Rice Bullet Lionel Corporation Physical characteristics of the Buddha Chocolate Coal Liquid crystal display Printed circuit board Printmaking Cancer

what products would you reccomend for combination oily skin my skin is a bit more on the oily side but only in the t zone area like after i wash my face or get out of the shower it goes from slightly shiny to shiny um regularly shiny i guess you can say in about minutes i use proactive cleanser toner and moisturizer every night and a gentle face wash or sometimes dove moisturizing body soap in the morning i really hate my skin looking like this because it gets real oily if i don't check on it every couple of hours also my pores are big especially in the nose area how can i make them go away my face is pretty clear except for a couple pimples every now and then i just turned so i'm not really sure if i'm ready to use foundation or powder on my face yet oh and some home made remedies would be nice too thanks so much try no to use the dove soap it tends to dry out the skin when you dry out the skin the pores try to compensate for the lost moisture and they produce more oil then you have more shine use a cream cleanser decleor and caudelie make a great cream cleanser i think clinique has a gentle cleanser too smashbox makes a great mattifier that helps take the shine away by just patting a bit on the oily areas stila makes a great tinted moisturizer for a little bit of coverage instead of a foundation  Cleanser Psoriasis Fecal incontinence Soap Acne Cosmetics Shaving Eczema Dry cleaning Tattoo Dandruff Skin Sento Dialysis Tofu Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Dairy Glycerin Rice Textile manufacturing Massage Hemp Jute Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Shampoo Wood Smoke-screen Scabies EastEnders Urinary incontinence Urticaria Soap opera Instant coffee Vinegar Diaper Weather lore First aid Wok Aloe Antiseptic Straw-bale construction Diving suit Diving Pepper spray Futurama (TV series - season 5) Manicure Bart chalkboard gags Michael Jackson Social rule Est__e Lauder Inc.

is it bad to use different brands of face cleansers not at the same time but like using neutrogena foaming cleanser and then later on using some peel thing would that cause more zits to pop up it could possibly dry your skin out to clean it more than once or twice a day drying out the skin can make more zits appear remember to tone and moisturize and give your skin time to recover in between cleansings on another note it is good to switch cleansers once in a while to give skin time to normalize and not completely adjust to the one you are using if your skin adjusts to a deep cleanser for example it might start to produce more oil and the deep cleanser is no longer effective  Cleanser Psoriasis Fecal incontinence Skin Dialysis Mattress Strap-on dildo Shampoo Drill bit Eczema Dishwasher Social rule Antiseptic Tofu Shaving Manicure Transformer Dietary fiber Dandruff Soap Rosacea Fire extinguisher Ultraviolet Upholstery Limonene Moisturizer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Smoke-screen Sulfuric acid Diaper Hypothermia Diving suit Apollo Command/Service Module Weather lore Human skin color Brewery Straw-bale construction Carburetor Fluorescent lamp Aloe Daylight saving time Childbirth Hemp Humidity 1957 World Series Timpani Popcorn Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Vinegar 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Scarification Knife Tanning Dry cleaning Thermal power station Saxophone Wok 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Fluoride therapy Fancy rat Sterilization (microbiology) Scar Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cantonese cuisine Toxic mold Casting Salah Bacon Urinary incontinence Sand casting Baldness treatments First aid WindowBlinds The End of the World (Doctor Who) Father's Day (Doctor Who) Massage Wound healing phases Michael Jackson Urea Hair Maprotiline Breathing gas Razor Baking Violin L'Or__al Sulfasalazine Carbon dioxide Haloalkane Bubble Bobble Smegma Puberty Olive oil Pump It Up Yarrow Bart chalkboard gags Tocopherol Fire fighting

i have scars from acne how do i get rid of it stop popping it's tempting but honestly it make things worse if you absolutely must pop make sure that the area and your fingers are clean and disinfected after you pop gently clean the area with warm water and a washcloth then cover the popped pimple with ice for a minute or two this will reduce the swelling with a cleaner pop and a smaller area to infect you greatly reduce your chances of getting a scab or scar keep with your regular acne treatments continue your twice a day face washes and applications of astringent if you don't have a very regulated method of treating and preventing acne then it's time to start one keep in mind that moisturizing isn't always best in all honesty you want these little scratches and scabs to stay dry this in a sense causes the scab to wither away and fall off on its own which reduces scratching and irritation thus reducing scars allow to heal naturally sometimes the best method of dealing with acne scars and cuts is just to let your body do the works keep the irritated area clean and dry and use as little make up on the area as possible avoid touching your face your hands can transfer additional oil and dirt to an infected area scars tend to be more noticeable on pale skin you can combat this with a safe self tanner not to be confused with tanning booths and or sun tanning which are unhealthy for your skin you could also buy a natural redness countering concealer neosporin is ideal for speeding up healing time thus causing lesser scarring there is also neosporin scar solution picking at the scabs and scars will only make things worse if your acne ruptures even when you don't touch it you need to see a dermatologist bleeding or excessive acne is not natural and may be the result of an infection or allergies get treatment as soon as possible acne is caused by a bacterial infections more times than not so understand that popping zits only spreads the infection  Tattoo Scar First aid Psoriasis Rosacea Keloid Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Conjunctivitis Dandruff Scarification Herpes simplex virus Allergy Malignant melanoma Common cold Skin Puberty Smallpox Tuberculosis Group A streptococcal infection Fecal incontinence Shaving Hydrogen peroxide Otitis externa Sterilization (microbiology) Cancer Rash Knife Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Upholstery Traumatic brain injury Water purification Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Carpal tunnel syndrome Diving Urinary incontinence Aloe Escherichia coli O157:H7 Isotretinoin Homeopathy Cleanser Mosquito Gonorrhoea Syphilis Pneumonia Dialysis Smegma Computer virus Antiseptic Asthma Manicure Ulcer Breastfeeding Scabies Sewage treatment Equine conformation Gramophone record Hay fever Coeliac disease Cat Medicine Circumcision Callus Lupus erythematosus Chronic fatigue syndrome Halitosis Dry cleaning Mouth ulcer Sunburn Menstrual cup Swimming Tofu Hearing impairment Hip fracture Medical analysis of circumcision Piccolo Junior Saga Myxobolus cerebralis Astringent Malaria Safe sex Anthrax Jock itch Earwax Bleeding AIDS Decompression sickness

what are those things called that cover your eyes when you tan they just cover the eyes on your face b c it's quite bright any ideas also do i have to buy a special lotion for when i tan how does that work so do i apply the lotion right before i tan or the night before they are called tanning goggles or peepers and they don't just protect your eyes from the bright light they also protect them from the uv rays the rays emitted from the sun or from the tanning booth can damage your eyes and lead to serious eye diseases like cataracts so you must wear eye protection when you tan you don't have to buy a special tanning lotion to tan i have tanned for a while and i've never bought tanning lotion you can put it on right before you tan and it is supposed to make you darker than you would be without the lotion but it's not neccessary you do want to moisturize with regular lotion at night or afer you shower because tanning can make your skin dry out lotion also helps you keep your tan longer if you go to a tanning salon they will most likely have goggles there that you can use or you can buy them for like which i would recommend you can also buy tanning lotion there if you decide you want to use it  Sunscreen Ultraviolet Sunlight Sunburn Upholstery Tocopherol Psoriasis Sunglasses Leather Diving Eczema Physical attractiveness Tanning Glasses Fecal incontinence Shaving Aloe Manicure Color Cosmetics Light Pubic hair Vitamin D Combine (Half-Life 2) Camouflage Skin Laser safety Malignant melanoma Urinary incontinence Goggles Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fluorescent lamp Albinism Imperial stormtrooper Welding Dragon Booster Comanche Wolfrider Battle of Long Tan Cathode ray tube Laser hair removal Social rule Scabies Paintball Massage Comet Sun tanning Acne Human skin color Sin City Diabetic retinopathy Dog Apparent magnitude Tire Osteoarthritis Diving suit Sun Arc welding Urticaria Houseplant Beret Parallax Smoke-screen Stomach cancer Naked eye Fluoroscopy Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Phoebe Buffay's songs Betting (poker) Light-emitting diode Melanin Health insurance Mattress Plame affair Herpes simplex virus Tobacco Mummy Bicycle lighting Color theory Diode Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Cyberspace The Wildhearts Eye Guan Yu Eye color Solar eclipse Happy Tree Friends Traffic light Electromagnetic spectrum Jon Secada Common bean Neighbours DEET Iris (anatomy) Criticism of Mormonism Grape seed oil Observational astronomy Only Fools and Horses Dyson sphere

any advice going to tanning salon hi i recently went to it and got red not sunburn tho bc its back to normal after a day weird but anyway when iu go back what should i do i used www hollywoodtans com the ht booth is wat i used well first of all you do know the risks of tanning right the people at the most risk for skin cancer are those who have pale skin freckles and a family history of skin cancer regular or prolonged exposure to uv rays can also cause premature aging of the skin sunspots and wrinkles if you still think it's worth it you need to develop a base tan first so go for a low amount of time until you get tan enough to where you can get as dark as you want depending on the power of the booth and how light skinned you are to begin with i would say don't go the maximum amount the first few times i have been tanning a lot and even though i tan in a bed which isn't as strong as the booths when i first started i made sure to go no more than minutes which is about halfway to the maximum time you can go you can gradually go more often and up the amount of time you go but try not to go too frequently or you could pay the consequences and another tip make sure you wear tanning goggles the uv rays can also cause eye damage like cataracts and you want your eyes to be protected good luck  Ultraviolet Sunburn Sunscreen Melanin Human skin color Sunlight Tocopherol Malignant melanoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psoriasis Cancer Physical attractiveness Ionizing radiation Welding Ozone depletion Puberty Sun tanning Leather Paintball Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ozone hole Swimming Androgen insensitivity syndrome Prostate cancer Decompression sickness Albinism Incandescent light bulb Solar variation Mobile phone radiation and health Light pollution Cephalic disorder Fluoroscopy Skin cancer Cryptorchidism Diving Stereoscopy Ozone layer Thimerosal Dragon Booster Intravenous therapy Human adaptation to space Herpes simplex virus Sleep Nuclear power Vitamin D Black Poker jargon Cheetah Sun Breastfeeding Ra (board game) Tobacco smoking Polycystic ovary syndrome Red hair Sunglasses Poison Hypoglycemia Birthmark Arc welding Betting (poker) Childbirth Elephant Redneck Smoke-screen Tropical cyclone Actinic keratosis Doxepin Electroshock gun E85 Chlorpromazine Scar Tattoo Uranium DNA repair RuneScape Colorectal cancer Weight training Laser safety Insurance Leopard Radiation poisoning Winning Streak Eczema Jaundice Rosacea Battle of Long Tan Cat Equine conformation Combine (Half-Life 2) Condom AIDS Fecal incontinence Armored Core 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate RuneScape skills Theory of conduct

my face has started to break out my face has started to break out nothing severe but it does bother me i have tried several things i always wash my face whenever i wear makeup what is a good product that is also inexpensive that would help with the breakouts and also get rid of the black heads on and around my nose they are not real noticeable but they do bother me thanks when removing your makeup always use a makeup removal instead of your daily cleanser follow by your toner etc there is so many products out there for breakouts and i'm not sure its for me to say what is good for me might not work on you if you are worried best to see a dermatologist for a cream which you apply only when you have a break out remember all products that for pimples are very drying to the skin so remember to put on a good moisturizor as for the blackhead you could get in the market pores strips to removed them but this is only a temporary method the best way to clear blackheads would be to have a facial at least twice a month don't worry too much cos maybe you are under some stress that causes the sudden break out i've the same problems wherenever i'm too stress or didn't get enough sleep hope this helps and take care  Psoriasis Tattoo Cleanser Eczema Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fecal incontinence Dialysis Cosmetics Diagon Alley Urinary incontinence Social rule Dandruff Traumatic brain injury Diving Unemployment Dairy Malignant melanoma Battle of Halbe Drill bit Waxing Theory of conduct Depilation 2000 Australian Grand Prix Surveillance FoxTrot Rosacea Piccolo Junior Saga Herpes simplex virus Shaggy dog story Shaving Cephalic disorder Dermatology The Amber Spyglass Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 1957 World Series Bicycle lighting Wart Battle of the Bulge Halitosis Stomach cancer Coffee Wood The Ashlee Simpson Show Socrates Avenue Q Scar Weezer Breastfeeding Lupus erythematosus Childbirth Printed circuit board Salah Insomnia Microeconomics Sento Pok__mon Live!

acne medication breaking out skin i recently have been using clean clear blackhead clearing scrub it is a saliglic acid acne medication i have noticed that my face turns a little pink after using it i also noticed that my forehead has broken out well i have heard people said that after using acne medications like pro active and others you break out because the product is drawing out the pores or something and then the product will start working is this true i have sensitive skin so does should i stop using this blackhead clearing scrub from clean clear proactive sucks and yes there are certain acne medications where you break out for a month and then the rest is history lol however for over the counter products no your skin is very sensitive the salyicic acid's purpose is to dry out your skin so the oil doesn't give you pimples but you should never use it in a scrub even if they say it's okay because it's not the fact that it's in scrub form is just more harsher on your skin it's peeling your skin and making it raw you are definately allergic to this product i reccomend natural products such as booth's arbonne etc these are the companies that make nice scrubs that will do nice things for your skin loool i think you should just try a regular face wash if you want to use a scrub you're only suppose to use it once a week twice at the most  Acne Psoriasis Skin Scar Puberty Tattoo Soap Rosacea Sulfuric acid Eczema Aloe Insulin Correlation implies causation (logical fallacy) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Glycerin Jute Surveillance Hay fever Fecal incontinence Hand washing First aid Moisturizer Spider Urinary incontinence Protein Textile manufacturing Kurt Angle Avenue Q Obsessive-compulsive disorder Sento Essential oil Urticaria The Legend of Zelda series races Keloid Acid Chocolate Leather Tofu Manicure Wood Dairy Hydrogen peroxide Shampoo Allergy Glen Jacobs Vince McMahon 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Boom Town (Doctor Who) TLC Retinol Dandruff Flue gas desulfurization Oral sex Potato Hydrogen chloride Social rule Clothing Smegma Body piercing Dexamethasone Tanning Wart Azelaic acid Tuberculosis Isotretinoin Nuclear fallout Benzoyl peroxide Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 2000 Australian Grand Prix Anabolic steroid Snake Doxepin Wok Thermal power station Theory of conduct Tarantula Hemp Animal testing Herpes simplex virus Microeconomics Extreme Programming Scrubs (TV show) Raney nickel The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Plastic Milk Psychosis Kevin Trudeau Cosmetics Baldness treatments Naval mine Multiple chemical sensitivity The Legend of Zelda series enemies World War Three (Doctor Who) Menstrual cup Salicylic acid Glucocorticoid

i swim a lot and yesterday i noticed my face was really dry so i tryed putting the face lotion i have clean and clear morning glow and it burned so i tryed some nivea stuff my mom had and it burned too the only thing that doesn't burn is aloe but it doesn't moisturize very well i don't want to put any regular lotion on my face either because my face has been breaking out a lot lately and i think that would probably just make it worse does anyone have any suggestions on a product i should try make sure to use products that are unscented and have a label that says dermatologist recommended my aunt is a dermatologist and she usually tells people that have dry irritated skin to use purpose moisturizer it is a brand of face products so choose the moisturizer for sensitive skin it is very gentle and won't irritate your skin i have used it before after getting sunburned and it feels great on my skin you can find it in any drug store like walgreen or cvs or eckerds aloe vera is also very good for your skin but i would recommend going to a health food store and buying natural aloe vera gel it will really heal your skin fast  Aloe Psoriasis Eczema Acne Sunburn Tattoo Shaving Scar Malignant melanoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tofu Sunscreen Skin Shampoo Dandruff Body piercing Dietary fiber Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Onion Ultraviolet Upholstery Medical prescription CVS/pharmacy Houseplant Wound healing phases Hemp Zinc Herpes simplex virus Scabies Vitamin D Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cleanser Sunlight Personal lubricant Avenue Q Hypoglycemia Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Walgreens Scarification Bulk vending Theory of conduct Stomach cancer Saki Manicure Food preservation Multiple chemical sensitivity Mattress Social rule Cosmetics Irritable bowel syndrome Urticaria Animal testing Massage Laser hair removal Explosive material Dairy Mosquito Hamster Lupus erythematosus Michael Jackson Motion picture rating system Tocopherol Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gelatin Hemorrhoid Baldness treatments Hydrogen peroxide Glycerin Piccolo Junior Saga Textile manufacturing Essential oil Shaggy dog story Keratosis pilaris Diving suit The Amber Spyglass Neighbours Sampling (music) Otitis externa Trans fat Atkins Nutritional Approach Diving Comet Great Teacher Onizuka Chronic fatigue syndrome Est__e Lauder Inc.

are mud masks good for ur skin i've heard they can shrink pores and make your skin soft and less pimply is this true it always depends on your skin type if you have super dry skin a mud mask may not be ideal for you instead find a hydrating mask to use once or twice a week and exfoliate daily if you have combination or oily skin mud masks are great they can detoxify the skin by pulling out impurities and calm the skin it also tends to dry out your skin so follow up with an herbal mist on your face or a light moisturizer only use a mud mask once a week and exfoliate every nd or rd day  Psoriasis Diving suit Soap Tofu Skin Weathering Eczema Urinary incontinence Tire Weather lore Mud People Cleanser Mummy Wood Fecal incontinence Leather Anchor Smoke-screen Professional wrestling match types Kanohi Ultraviolet Dialysis Portland cement Radiation therapy Sulfuric acid Shaving Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Smegma Building material Toa Group A streptococcal infection Polyethylene terephthalate The Legend of Zelda series enemies Thermoregulation Aloe Prostate cancer Diaper Alien races from the Godzilla films Chlorpromazine Frogman Leaf Earthworm Stomach cancer Naruto jutsu Material properties of diamond Depilation Bionicle MUD Cantonese cuisine Houseplant Malignant melanoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hemp Esophageal cancer The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Desert Physical attractiveness Goldfinger Full face diving mask Bacon Link (Legend of Zelda) Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Climate of the United Kingdom Collectibles in Bionicle Upholstery Use of poison gas in World War I Insulin Shampoo Urticaria Onion Brick Dandruff Dehydration Oceanic trench Monster Rancher monsters Tutankhamun Green tea Mud volcano Kanoka Mask Gas mask Glycerin Transformer Hair Sebaceous gland The Electric Company Carbon dioxide Otitis externa The Caves of Androzani Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Supernova Katana Concrete RahXephon Sugar beet Ceramics Human skin color The Legend of Zelda series races

a good treatment for pores recommend me a good once or twice a week treatment for closing pores cleanse and rinse natural oils can build up beneath pores and cause bacteria to grow wash your face thoroughly but not aggressively use a mild cleanser that is meant for your skin type dry normal oily or combination skin make sure to rinse skin completely to eliminate soapy residue use a toner on your skin to diminish blemishes delicate rose water toners smell beautiful as well as do the job exfoliate the dead skin cells a gentle scrub with a grainy texture will remove dead skin which could clog pores exfoliating also allows other products to penetrate your skin more effectively mask it apply a mask to your face to draw out dirt from deep within the pores don't rub harshly or the skin could become damaged and develop further skin complications try mixing almond meal with water to make a natural mask and let it sit for approximately minutes before rinsing draw in pore size have a professional facial and or extraction to minimize overall pore appearance eliminating blackheads can tighten pores and give the visible appearance of shrinking use additional products like antioxidant creams to reduce the effects of over exposure to sun and pollutants you'll feel rejuvenated too maintain your skins restoration with a regular cleansing and moisturizing regime healthy skin makes you look radiant and feel great  Psoriasis Cleanser Tofu Tattoo Skin Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Eczema Upholstery Halitosis Dialysis Shampoo Insulin Fecal incontinence Wood Ultraviolet Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Decompression sickness Corrosion Nutrition Dandruff Vinegar Urinary incontinence Sewage treatment Tooth Diving suit Leaf Cancer Pneumonia Shaving Stomach cancer Chlorpromazine Malignant melanoma Water Body piercing Manicure Leather Urticaria Smegma Sterilization (microbiology) Dairy Mesothelioma Radiation therapy Traumatic brain injury Scar Rosacea Diseases of the honeybee Cheese Hard water Prostate cancer Embalming Cephalic disorder Massage Thermal power station Moisturizer Tea Essential oil Dishwasher Herpes simplex virus Tocopherol Energy development Pulmonary alveolus Biodiesel Sento Carbon dioxide Mattress Diabetes mellitus Dead Sea Brewery Water purification Bong Smoke-screen Baldness treatments Fugu Hypoglycemia Tissue engineering Rice Allergy Otitis externa Fancy rat Textile manufacturing Menstrual cup Mosquito Stem cell Welding Common cold Clinical depression Sugar Coffee Sunburn Drill bit

what should i do about my razor bumps everytime i shave i get razor bumps and sometimes it even starts to bleed a little what should i use do so i dont get any bumps especially on my armpits thanks make sure you use a clean and sharp razor ideally you shouldn't use a razor more than a dozen times or so i find it helps to wipe it down after every shower with a cotton ball soaked in rubbing alcohol i think it keeps them from getting dull shave with the hair grain so shave in a downward motion never up shave only on wet skin and only after the hair has been throughly wetted with warm water so the skin opens up i've found dove or even hair conditioner just a cheap kind works best for me as opposed to shaving gels and the like  Shaving Razor Pubic hair Hypothermia Leather Global Gillette Diving suit Pseudofolliculitis barbae Tanning Happy Tree Friends Hair Manicure Knife Strap-on dildo Barber Haircut Beard Hyperthermia Leg shaving Shampoo Depilation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Violin Toilet paper Head shaving Textile manufacturing Aerial (dance move) Scabies Acne Ron and Fez Psoriasis Baldness Caving Aloe Internal ballistics Skin First aid Tofu Wound 613 mitzvot Sento Callus Professional wrestling throws Urinary incontinence Swimming Mosquito Goose bumps Tarantula Joker (comics) Towel Hair color Earwax Soap Menstrual cup Jock itch Otitis externa Hazing Volleyball Gay bathhouse Bong Occam's Razor Clothing Breastfeeding Genericized trademark Diving Thermoregulation Gilding Barley Samson Poodle Mattress Leaf Drowning Hamster Sauna Russian joke Hiking Laser hair removal Tattoo Three Stooges Diaper Upholstery Smallpox Coffee Social rule Carnivorous plant Ethanol Professional wrestling match types Boil Waxing Stomach cancer Fecal incontinence Brush Wet and messy fetishism Frogman King C.

just got my tongue pierced jad my tongue done days ago it didnt hurt but now i have a sharp pain in the very tip and from the ball underneath to the tip when i try to curl it up or stretch it out is that normal and will it go away and why does it do that well you asked the question days ago so hopefully the pain will have died down a little i've had mine done days ago and noticed a sharpish pain when i tried to curl the tongue around the piercing but that was also because the swelling had gone right down and the bar was able to slide up and down quite a lot if yours is still swollen i'd say swill some salty water a teaspoon of salt in half a cup of hot water topped up to a full cup with cold water should do it also invest in some mouthwash that's not alcohol based and swill that times per day that will reduce the risk of infection and hopefull take the pain away in a day or two if your tongue's still swollen make sure you have some crushed ice and allow it to melt around the tongue which will help the swelling to come down lastly try some ibuprofen which might help with the swelling and pain a little good luck  Body piercing Mouth ulcer Glacier Halitosis Professional wrestling holds Glossitis First aid Tongue piercing Nipple piercing Carpal tunnel syndrome Tea Group A streptococcal infection Sodium chloride Traumatic brain injury Penis Dehydration Tattoo Water (molecule) Trumpet Sea ice Coffee Intravenous therapy Gout Happy Tree Friends Breastfeeding Bruise Corrosion Diving Naruto jutsu Lip piercing Cramp Menstrual cup Curling Mosquito Spark plug Tongue Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Earring Death Valley National Park Harmonica Acupuncture Cocaine Internal ballistics Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Baseball Paracetamol Decompression sickness Ice cream Sunburn Piccolo Junior Saga Franklin Pierce Osteoarthritis Beer Pong Trapping Oral sex Manicure Soldering Natural disaster Deluge (prehistoric) Surfing Phimosis Mayonnaise Swimming Violin Nasal congestion Tsunami Cancer Casting Bong Effects of global warming Angioedema Hepatitis Sea level rise Methamphetamine Hip fracture Dead Sea Fast bowling Shark Dental caries Chocolate Salty Balls Psoriasis RuneScape weapons Equine conformation Creatures in Bionicle Metroid Prime Radiation therapy Prince Albert piercing Common cold Ear piercing instrument Salt Pharyngitis Cat Thermal power station Gonorrhoea Vinegar Otitis externa Snooker Malaria Weight training Snake

playboy bunny tattoo i am unsure as to why people would find a tattoo of the playboy bunny offensive i feel that by getting that tattoo in a area like your back or belly you are showing that you are in touch with your sexuality and comfortable with the way you look i just wanted to get some people's opinions thanks alright well first of all i like your attitude about it i feel that people who warn others against getting certain tattoos or whatever done because they'll regret it later in life should just shut it i believe that if you want to do something to your body then do it you don't want to get old and look back on life and regret not living and doing the things that you wanted with that being said i'm going to be completely honest with you i think the playboy bunny is such a cliche symbol it doesn't really hold a lot of meaning anymore i think tattoos should be more personal and have a lot of meaning but don't listen to my opinion just do what you want to your body and screw what others say  Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist One Tree Hill (TV series) Sexual revolution Sexual orientation Playboy (magazine) Joke Homophobia Tattoo Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Anderson Cooper Sluggy Freelance Self-harm Theory of conduct Britney Spears The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Social rule Anya Jenkins Earth Girl Arjuna Irezumi Clothing Straight edge Shaggy dog story Marilyn Monroe Friends Criminal tattoo Kender Past teachings of Prem Rawat Stewie Griffin Sexually-transmitted infection Current teachings of Prem Rawat Pip (South Park episode) Highway 61 Revisited Gay Capital punishment Treehouse of Horror XV Cliff Richard Body piercing Earring The Death Gate Cycle Patricia Ford Honey and Clover Rick Santorum Human sexual behavior Super Mario 128 Karen McDougal Autobiography (Ashlee Simpson album) Jon Secada Laws of Singapore Characters in the Smurfs Pamela Anderson Transactional analysis Ed Wood, Jr. Goatse.cx Homunculi of Fullmetal Alchemist Ron and Fez Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Ty Cobb One Piece minor characters Big Brother UK series 6 Sharon Tate Brian Griffin Amy Dumas Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Real Love (song) Time Out of Mind EastEnders Skin of Evil (TNG episode) Weezer Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Gesture Smallville (Season 4) Yoko Ono Strap-on dildo Lie Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Ion Davidov Laura Schlessinger Lonely Among Us (TNG episode) Wonderland (McFly album) Motion picture rating system True Crime: Streets of LA Year of the Spider Herbert Garrison Rape A Hard Day's Night (song) Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Abortion debate Repentance Polyamory Transsexuality Sex and the City Coming of Age (TNG episode) Love Maison Ikkoku Batman Elijah Wood I Want to Hold Your Hand Ouroboros Liam Gallagher

cartilage piercing i am in months and my mother agreed that if i still want one when i am i can get my cartilage pierced i was thinking of getting a regular helix piercing in my right ear and when that heals up a midhelix on my left ear maybe of them one after the othr i was wondering if this would hurt a lot and if it would be possible for me to get a freezing spray or something to lessen the pain it is possible to use a freezing spray if your worried about the pain but some people say that it can slow down the healing process i prefer not to use it its only for a few short seconds that you will feel it being pierced thats all the freezing spray can reduce then it will be sore for a couple of weeks if that the freezing spray cannot stop that however its not an unbearable feeling as long as you look after the piercing and keep it clean you have plenty of time to research into it and find information on aftercare good luck  Body piercing Earring Breastfeeding Myxobolus cerebralis Social rule Cartilage Tattoo Equine conformation Ear Piercing migration Childbirth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Ear piercing instrument Traumatic brain injury Paget's disease of bone Mouth ulcer Piccolo Junior Saga Nose piercing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Contender (television series) Team Fortress Classic Blood (computer game) Tongue piercing Dobermann Swimming Milton H.

if i could handle a lip piercing very well could i handle a tongue piercing i got my lip pierced and i didn't feel a thing alright i have both of those piercings among many many others so i feel i can talk intelligently about this the tongue piercing is somewhat more painful than the lip piercing at the actual time of piercing however the healing time is much worse it will be very swollen almost impossible to eat very painful and very irritating the majority of people who take out their tongue piercings do it within the first week because they can't handle the healing process but if you think you can handle it then by all means go for it  Tongue piercing Garfield Nipple piercing Piercing migration Stuttering Tattoo Janet Jackson American Psycho Oral sex Ear piercing instrument Earring Keloid Penis Scientology beliefs and practices Barbell (piercing) Body modification Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tongue Carpal tunnel syndrome Trumpet Book of Isaiah Tooth Traumatic brain injury Lip piercing Twelve Swords of Power Hemorrhoid Mouth ulcer Irritable bowel syndrome Frenulum Bruise The Amber Spyglass Prince Albert piercing Hawkeye Pierce Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Inflammation Wisdom teeth Frank Burns M*A*S*H (TV series) Emo fashion Play piercing Stomach cancer Spider Navel piercing Marilyn Monroe Oral cancer Nine Inch Nails Cocaine Cliff Richard Kender Knife Chiropractic Debugging HAL 9000 Milton H.

disposable razors how do you use them ive never used a razor before you need shaving cream or something or can you just shave your legs like that details are appreciated thnx to those who answer heey well i would buy quite a good razor not really cheap cause most of them end up giving you nicks and they don't give you a nice shave buy a brand that is quite big and be prepared to pay a little extra for a good one ooh i have also found that mens shavers work really well your legs look like they have been proffesionally waxed gillete's mens works well also some shaving gel cream would work but if your short on cash a really good alternative is hair conditioner it is good when you shave it works best in the bath because the steam opens up your pores and you can do it sitting down put the gel cream conditioner whatever on the area where you are going to shave and keep it off the water shave in the opposite direction of hair growth for example leg hair grows downwards so shave upwards be careful on the knees and joints you don't want any nicks they aren't painful but boy do you bleed a lot when finished pat yourself dry and put some lotion on the area where you've shaved for extra silkiness a tan makes those pins look even hotter go by the pool for a tan or some lotion that builds a gradual tan nivea works well do not shave your face or anything like that it's just wrong for a girl but yeah if you want to shave armpits sure but wax sometimes cause you don't wanna be left with dark pits extra hope that helped ox lotsa love vicky x  Shaving Pubic hair Razor Leg shaving Sento Professional wrestling holds Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Depilation Professional wrestling throws Haircut Hair Puberty Waxing Manicure Beard Poker jargon Dairy Professional wrestling slang Upholstery Ren and Stimpy Aerial (dance move) Psoriasis Hiberno-English Comanche Ron and Fez True Crime: Streets of LA Powerbomb Jon Secada Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Happy Tree Friends Little Britain Guinea pig The Ashlee Simpson Show Humphrey Bogart Billboard Hot 100 Textile manufacturing Strap-on dildo Care Bears Menstrual cycle 613 mitzvot Sin City Coffee Tanning Professional wrestling match types 2000 Australian Grand Prix Leather Tarantula Gay bathhouse Tofu Shaggy dog story Stomach cancer The Adventures of Pete & Pete Theory of conduct Joker (comics) Skinhead Wound Fecal incontinence Singlish Keeshond Full House Kurt Angle Shawn Michaels Knife Teen Girl Squad The Beach Boys Timmy Turner Cuisine of Denmark Gelatin Casting Fast bowling Friends Sunlight Osteoarthritis Dog Moustache Acne Joe Namath Swimming Leaf Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers About a Boy Diving Barber Laser hair removal Codename: Kids Next Door The Fairly OddParents Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Physical attractiveness Hall & Oates Backstroke
