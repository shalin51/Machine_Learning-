is there a formula for calculating the estimated price i should spend on buying a home k yr i am looking for a formula that will give me the price range i should be looking at based off of my annual salary of per year there is one rule of thumb and one more complicated formula rule of thumb is between x your annual salary so between and would most likely be ok rules of thumb are just that and could vary significantly depending on many factors downpayment amount credit score history other debt etc the better calculation is the rule this means that no more than of your gross income should go for your housing payment in your case that is about per month that is usually referred to as piti principal interest taxes and insurance principal and interest are dictated by price of home rate on mortgage size of downpayment etc taxes and insurance vary greatly by region so look at it closely the part of the rule is that all of your debt payments shouldn't exceed of your monthly income in your case this means any car loans credit card payments student loan payments etc the rule will keep you reasonably happy about your debt load banks used to use this ratio and were strict about it in the past years or so they seemed to relax quite a bit and now that is coming back to haunt them so i would imagine that it is returning to these types of standards good luck  Mortgage Annuity Insurance Student loan Real estate bubble Gross domestic product Tax Personal finance Interest Economy of Russia Credit card Social Security (United States) Microeconomics Inflation FairTax Taxation in the United States Life insurance Bank Money Unemployment benefit National Insurance Debt Economy of India Cost of capital Capital accumulation Islamic banking Surplus value United Kingdom corporation tax Monetary policy Great Depression Gold standard Measures of national income and output Auto insurance History of the United States (1918-1945) Derivative (finance) Deflation (economics) Bretton Woods system Economy of the United States Hyperinflation Primerica Financial Services Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Federal National Mortgage Association 401(k) U.S. public debt Security (finance) Health insurance Economy of Pakistan Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Education in the United States Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Government debt Estoppel Pension Government National Mortgage Association Credit derivative Compensation of employees History of post-Soviet Russia Income trust Leasing Donald Trump Euro Economy of Romania Mortgage-backed security Collateralized debt obligation Municipal bond Dividend Annual percentage rate Weighted average cost of capital Savings and loan association Unemployment Productive and unproductive labour Short selling Finance Corporate finance Supply and demand Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Arthur Laffer Small business Explosive material Property tax Solar cell Publicly funded medicine Marshall Plan Social Credit Monopoly (game) PE ratio Free trade Subsidy Income tax Economic relations of Japan

what is all this about mortgages on the news i hear all this stuff about mortgages on the news this weekend what does it all mean i am not very familiar with mortgages so please explain it thoroughly thanks for your help i just don't like not knowing what they are talking about on the news and was wondering if it would effect any people i know who have mortgages during the housing boom of the last few years lenders issued mortgages to many buyers who were stretching themselves financially to buy a home to make it possible for the buyers to make the mortgage payments the lenders issued adjustable rate mortgages on which the interest rate and monthly payments are very low during the first few years then increase in future years requiring higher monthly payments on the mortgage many speculators bought houses with such loans in the hope of selling them for a higher price now the housing market is in a slump and a lot of the mortgages are hitting the time when monthly payments are increasing home buyers who cannot make the higher payments are having trouble selling their homes and many of the loans are going into default that means that the banks that issued these mortgages now have to repossess the homes on which payments are not being made mortgages are in the news now because the number of defaults and repossessions is much higher than normal lenders are in financial difficulty getting study with houses that are not selling and buyers are losing their homes because they cannot make the monthly payments  Financial markets Debt Federal National Mortgage Association Student loan Monetary policy Predatory lending Real estate bubble Interest Interest rate Mortgage-backed security Derivative (finance) Real estate broker Islamic banking Deflation (economics) Finance Personal finance Insurance Housing cooperative Privatization Life insurance Annual percentage rate Central bank Credit card Annuity Microeconomics FairTax Great Depression Citigroup Government debt Security (finance) Economy of Russia Futures contract Collateralized mortgage obligation Short selling Savings and loan association Economy of the United States Supply and demand Leasing Bretton Woods system Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Primerica Financial Services Hire purchase Foreclosure Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation British property bubble Irish Property Bubble British residential property market Rational pricing Taxation in the United States Mergers and acquisitions Arbitrage Federal Reserve History of the United States (1918-1945) Hong Kong Monetary Authority Stock market Inflation Money Internet fraud Real estate 401(k) Consumer finance Price discrimination Asian financial crisis Hyperinflation Credit score Mobile home U.S. public debt Temasek Holdings Credit derivative Yield curve Donald Trump Islamic economics Gross domestic product Free trade Securitization DBS Bank Concurrent estate History of post-Soviet Russia Call option Argentine Currency Board Municipal bond Conveyancing Capital accumulation Unconscionability Harlem Economy of India Dot-com

is it legal for my apartment complex in los angeles to only allow me to use one cable installing company i am moving into a new place and the only way to get cable and internet is to use this company called consolidated smart systems they only do direct tv and charge an extra dollars a month to maintain the service which sounds like a total scam to me is it legal for an apartment building to not only limit me to having to use direct tv instead of any cable provider but to have to use this sneaky company that will install it and add extra chargers for example i can't call direct tv and have them install it i have to use these middle men that only install direct tv i assume the company has some deal going with the landlord where they get cutbacks or something is there anything i can do i've already signed the lease so i am stuck actually it is against the law to prohibit any tenant from choosing their own cable or direct tv provider go to the fcc website for all the rules a landlord cannot tell the tenant who they will use even if it is in the lease its against the law his lease is invalid because of it being against the law so call the cable company you want and use it let this landlord tell you that you broke the lease then show him the fcc website print it out and tell him that he broke the law and if he tries to throw you out of your house you will contact the attorney general the fcc and the city inspectors and turn him in you would have a heck of a law suit i have just gone through this with one of my tenants only difference is my tenant is a lawyer and not a very good one she did everything wrong including attaching a dish satillite to my outside roof against fcc and my rules and did not use the existing dish provided for this very thing she lost and ended up paying to have it removed and the roof repaired print out those laws on the fcc com  Cable television Leasehold estate Federal Communications Commission United Kingdom corporation tax WWOR-TV Broadband Internet access Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Barrister Leasing Rental agreement Apartment Estoppel Trademark Eviction Poker jargon Islamic banking Appeal North American Numbering Plan New York Central Railroad American Broadcasting Company Intellectual property Media in Canada Housing cooperative Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Kazaa Japanese law Elevator New Hampshire Supreme Court Obscenity Property (ownership right) Property law Serfdom Public domain Prostitution in Germany First-sale doctrine Public transport 9-1-1 Television in the United States Insurance Waste (law) Contract Article One of the United States Constitution Boston and Lowell Railroad Credit repair Universal Serial Bus Rent control Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Modem Freedom of speech Digital television ITV Make money fast Plame affair World Trade Center Concurrent estate Land tenure Amateur radio Home Box Office AT&T Solar power Sealand Wi-Fi Voice over IP Strategic lawsuit against public participation Attorney General Babylonian law Fixtures Direct marketing Real property Ethernet Teletext Copyright law of the United Kingdom Lawyer Trust (Law) USA Pirate decryption Tennessee State Constitution Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Oscilloscope Government of Maryland High-voltage direct current Confidence trick Concentration of media ownership Judiciary of Hong Kong Scots law Same-sex marriage in the United States Manorialism Public housing Television Monopoly (game) Copyright Naval Station Norfolk High-definition television United States Postal Service French nobility Easement Eminent domain

when your home is in foreclosure can you sell your home when your home is in foreclosure can you sell your home two ways get a buyer with enough money to pay off your mortgage the title company will set it all up and the bank will be thrilled to drop the foreclosure to get a check for the full amount you owe at the closing or you could try for a short sale you agree to let the house be shown without notice at any agreed upon times you agree to get out with no rights of redemption immediately at the closing which will be when the bank can find a buyer at any price you agree to stay to maintain the house and keep it safe until said closing you may get the bank to agree to not report you to the credit reporting bureaus the bank will only report that the mortgage has been discharged paid banks agree to this for a few reasons they don't have to pay to secure the house they pay less in legal fees they don't have to worry about vandalism since they are probably losing money anyway why not limit the loss a little in exchange for less legal hassles and the waiting that foreclosure means sometimes you can even get them to agree to give you some money for moving expenses typically to you may get to live free as the 'caretaker' for several months while they find a buyer of course this only works in an area that is saturated with foreclosed houses and when you owe more that the house is worth and if your property is well maintained currently if you owe far less than the house is worth or your property is a pig sty or your property is desirable this ploy might not work get with your mortgage holder and start negotiating good luck  Foreclosure Bond Government National Mortgage Association Security (finance) Predatory lending Allodial title Microeconomics Short selling Credit card Insurance Debt Capitalism Contract Internet fraud Derivative (finance) Mutual fund Islamic banking Gold standard Taxation in the United States Great Depression Tax Real estate broker Deflation (economics) Monopoly (game) Poker jargon Hyperinflation Money Futures contract Supply and demand Copyright Conveyancing Unconscionability Bank Concurrent estate Leasing Financial markets U.S. public debt Option Gold as an investment Advance fee fraud Cheque Student loan Mergers and acquisitions Corporation MMORPG Intellectual property Estoppel Fractional-reserve banking Bretton Woods system Public domain Arbitrage Housing cooperative Temasek Holdings Enron Corporation Monopoly 401(k) Inflation Dividend Wal-Mart Capital accumulation Labor theory of value Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Child support Anarchism and capitalism Annuity Price discrimination United Kingdom corporation tax Copyleft Primerica Financial Services Title insurance Fiat money Interest Auction Investment bank Call option Economy of Russia Federal National Mortgage Association Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Commodity markets Monetary policy Mortgage-backed security SCO-Linux controversies Real estate bubble Health insurance Construction Life insurance ITV Mobile home GNU General Public License Privatization Lehigh and New England Railroad American individualist anarchism Craps Option style Identity theft

is it true a person can't pay cash for a house in texas my grandfather thinks so thats seems odd to me can give me any information about this several years ago there were laws that prevented you from taking out a mortgage on a home you already owned it was designed to protect you from borrowing against your homestead and maybe losing it to foreclosure i remember a lot of brokers telling people it was a risky idea to pay cash for a home because they could not borrow it back out if they needed to later i am guessing this is where your grandpa got that idea of course you have always been able to pay cash for a house here  Mortgage Insurance Predatory lending Allodial title Bond Life insurance Warren Buffett Finance Stock Foreclosure Real estate broker Intellectual property Mortgage-backed security Johnny Cash Bank fraud Poker jargon Debt Rational pricing Theory of conduct Surveillance Citigroup Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Craps Adverse possession Savings and loan association Betting (poker) Personal finance Margin (finance) Copyright Annuity Piccolo Junior Saga Mergers and acquisitions Mutual fund Money Keynesian economics Squatting Derivative (finance) EastEnders History of the United States (1918-1945) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Fixed income Property (ownership right) Tom DeLay Microcredit Universal Studios Financial markets Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Interest The writing of Principia Mathematica Abraham Simpson Housing cooperative Homestead exemption ACORN Debt consolidation Password Short selling Oakland Athletics Concurrent estate Corporation Construction Dave Ramsey Great Depression Irish Property Bubble Tax Socrates Variable universal life insurance Islamic banking Savings and Loan crisis Easement Personal property Bankruptcy in the United States Credit card Habitat for Humanity International Inflation Joseph Smith, Jr. She Loves You Real estate bubble Capital accumulation Liability Rent (musical) Wheel of Fortune Home insurance New Deal Plame affair Municipal bond Big Brother UK series 6 Modern portfolio theory Collateralized mortgage obligation Nashville Skyline Mobile home Corporate finance Supply and demand Government National Mortgage Association Deflation (economics) Child support Tithe PE ratio Gambling Social Security (United States)

how can i sell a town house without a realetor im trying to sell my townhouse without a professional if you have no real estate knowledge then it will be difficult but not impossible if you are willing to do the work and research a little you can sell your home yourself remember that selling a home is not easy and extremely time consuming especially in the current state of the real estate market if you have very little time and an inflexible schedule then i would recommend getting a realtor if you do have the time and some money to spend on advertising then give it a shot you can always get a realtor later if it doesn't work out i once had a seller call me and asked me if i could talk to some of my pre qualified clients there is nothing worse then agreeing with a buyer and finding out later that they did not qualify for the loan to buy it hope this helps  Real estate broker Microeconomics Mortgage Internet fraud Real estate Real estate bubble Technical analysis Life insurance Option Capitalism Mergers and acquisitions Supply and demand Privatization Economics Insider trading Citigroup Marketing research Stock market Gross domestic product Islamic banking Joseph P.

when the housing market declines how does that affect the rental market as far as rental prices and if your going to guess please don't bother because i can do the same thanks there are a couple case scenerios when a housing market declines prices will fall as some people will still need to sell and can only accomplish that with a price reduction some tenants that can now afford to by a home will do so on the flip side some people will continue to rent because inability to buy a home lack of desire to care for a home or in the case of a poor economic situation might opt to rent because they are uncertain about the job status or similar after years as a landlady basically in an unstable market i chose not to raise my rents to existing or new tenants in the case of an apartment turnover essentially rents are set as a result of supply and demand if there's a shortage of apartments in your area you're in a better position to raise rents good luck  Housing cooperative Supply and demand Leasehold estate Rent control Microeconomics Public housing Renting Value added Apartment building Monopoly (game) Inflation Surplus value Real estate bubble Economic shortage Estoppel Economy of Russia Economic rent Mobile home Intermediate consumption Gentrification Apartment American individualist anarchism Capitalism Free trade First-sale doctrine Real estate economics Unemployment Law of value Economic inequality Leasing Monopoly Publicly funded medicine Labour economics Say's law Rental agreement Protectionism Famine Harlem Sharecropping Externality Prices of production Health insurance Economics Labor theory of value British residential property market Black market Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Great Depression Progressive tax Economy of Africa Economy of Nigeria Overpopulation Laserdisc Babylonian law Stuyvesant Town Exchange value Economy of Haiti FairTax Monetary policy Exchange rate Probability Economic equilibrium Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Council house Poverty line Superprofit Bond White flight Videocassette recorder Network effect Prostitution in Germany Forward contract Newtown, New South Wales Monopsony Neoclassical economics Economic calculation problem Public policy Anarchism and capitalism Natural monopoly Geolibertarianism Minimum wage Eviction Money Efficiency wages Economic relations of Japan Parasite singles Common Agricultural Policy Privatization United Kingdom corporation tax Price discrimination Supply-side economics Asian financial crisis Annuity Canadian and American health care systems compared Commodity Arthur Laffer Gold standard New Urbanism

can the landlord legally do this just a few questions and i need quick answers and if anyone recommends me taking this to court we had a diff landlord before and we lost our jobs so he gave us time to get things striaghtened we were on the last month to pay up before this new guy started once he was gettin ready to take over he told us he wanted us to catch up with things as we were down to last month we were short bucks told him we have it the next day and he tells us well u got days to be out and only pay or i will get a evictin notice and i will take u to court making you pay and you will not win the case because of a late payment even thou we said we could pay it and would have the dollers the next day or the same day for the rest comes to find out our naighbor downstars had been envolved with out evicting complain of problems with us u cannot stop a anf yr old who been on a hour ride to settle down right away we caught her at his place and we caught hinm talkin to her about us isnt tha against privacy act when you tell another tendent about all your business as being evicted when you have to move he hasvnt giving us a evicting notice and keeps harassing us legally he has to give us one before we are evicted i think this who business isnt fair when he told me he wants us to be caught up and then turns around and wants to throw us out and then tells anothet tendent all of our business i dont think tha legal he wants us out monday because the cleaners are coming but he just cant boot us out when he feels unless he took it to court right or wrong do you think i should get a lawyer because the day he came to get his money we had the money he just didnt wanna see if we could get the tha day or tomarrow which we could have gotten it tha day if he gacve us a chance i think it manly because of her complaining of things we have never done and of course being late tha time didnt help but he stated to us he wanted us caught up please help i know i can be evicted for not paying but wha im saying is he offered me to get caught up which i was doing was down to my last month of gettin caught up he came to collect i had the money for him just short bucks was gonna ask her mother or ask him to wait till tomarrow and i will have the rest he right away wanted to evict me even thou he said he give me time to get caught up and hopes we get caught up and so forth wha i meaning with the neighbor downstairs can he legally tell my personally buiness with me and the landlord about me being evicted and wha for to her isnt tha against privacy act and she filed complaints of noise since we first moved her and the landlord before ignored her because he new she was being rediculas about everything and making false statments but this new landlord is taking everything way to far with her and tha more of the reason why he wants to evict us i have the money to pay the late tha i owed him i also have the money to pay for this month right now if i needed to but he didnt even give me a chance i was only bucks short i told him i have it today or tomarrow the bucks and i will have the rest before the tha is do for next month but he told me because of noise and past i cant but i never really made noise only when i moved in and when my sister visted for days i dont party or nothing like tha i go to work come home and watch tv and the only thing tha was in my past was when i lost my job and once i got another one months later i paid all my dues i owed like the landlord before this one requested but i still dont see how he can just evicted me on his terms without no papers and no so forth even thou i had the money and everything was fine he still wanted me out dosnt make sense tha wha im askin wha can i do cuz i cant find anything in the time i have thanx i'm not here to look for sympathy im looking for answers if you dont have anything nice to say then please do not respond to what im asking if you cannot comprehend what im typing then please dont bother im looking for answers not critizim this to me is serious and im needed serious help and there not my kids they were my sisters nd she visted for days the first day she arrived was the only time they really made noise everyday before o clock which is the time on the lease the children were in bed and even the landlord said one time he came when she had called and never heard a sound but as far as him going downstairs and talking with her about why and wha im being evicted for dosnt sound right to me she has caused me problems since i first arrived west virginia i dont want to stay here the the last thing on my mind but he keeps wanting to push me out in a few days and i cant do it untill i find sumthing he told me days or to court but i packed everything just cant do it in

moving in a roommate who is not on the lease my boyfriend is in need of a place to stay and i've offered up my place but would i get in trouble with my apartment since he's not on the lease or could i add him as just an occupant without having to have my cosigner sign it my cosigner is my dad and i'd prefer him not to know most landlords would require the basic screening to be done on anyone that would live in their building he should be able to be added to the lease as an occupant only but not a lease holding resident this means that the occupant would not be financially responsible for any of the rent amount if you add anyone as an occupant there is no reason the cosigner would be informed of this the cosigner is only contacted if you default on payments so your dad would not find out hope this helps  Leasehold estate Student loan Housing cooperative Leasing NorthBridge Apartment Complex Chatham Square Vista Way Apartment Rental agreement Life insurance The Commons Mortgage Eviction Donald Trump Prostitution in Germany Estoppel 401(k) Rent (musical) Annuity Avenue Q Anarchism and capitalism Credit card Domain Name System Gross domestic product Insurance Taxation in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Legal system of Hong Kong United Kingdom corporation tax Airline Free trade Squatting Income trust Islamic banking Money Contract Octopus card Hani Hanjour Gender-neutral language Child support Terri Schiavo Gentrification Oplan Bojinka 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Social Security (United States) Accounting methods Bratislava Castle Nawaf al-Hazmi Babylonian law Public housing Friends Social rule Hong Kong Family name Economic inequality Ponzi scheme Education in Japan Derivative (finance) Rest area Renting Boston and Lowell Railroad Mary Jane Kelly GunBound Mohamed Atta al-Sayed Father American individualist anarchism Public transport Lend-Lease Irish Land Act American Dad!

a question for agents homebuyer i am in the process of waiting on a counter offer from a seller it is a forecloser the home is in great condition no water damage clean etc on the listing it says the seller will not turn on electricity does this mean there's a problem with the wiring that they don't want to disclose or is this common for them not to turn it on the previous tenants were renting to own they did not pay so they were kicked out also is it possible for the previous renters renting to own can come back and claim the property if they pay what they owe i will not be renting to own i will have a loan outright any advice appreciated when you enter a contract to purchase a home the property must be 'free of incumberances' which means that the seller needs to bring taxes up to date outstanding utility bills and end any leases rent to own or other contracts on the property also most purchase offers include a contingency that a home inspection must be satisfactory to get a thorough home inspection most inspectors will need the power water and gas turned on so that they can test all the household systems plumbing air heat for function and leaks they might not turn on the power just for you to walk thru the property but need to for an inspection a 'satisfactory' inspection does not mean the house 'passes' or 'fails' it just means that whatever the inspector turns up is ok with you you might be ok with fixing some drywall but not ok with mold in the basement you as the buyer gets to decide what is satisfactory enough for you the previous renters potential purchasers can't claim the property if the seller followed their contract and evicted them properly ask the seller to document that the rent to own contract is void or terminated if the property was a simple rental then the family who got evicted don't have any rights to the property at all  Mortgage Contract Rental agreement Leasing Leasehold estate Real estate broker Microeconomics Renting Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Security (finance) Monopoly (game) Conveyancing First-sale doctrine Capitalism Economics Allodial title Electrical wiring Oil-for-Food Programme Supply and demand Plame affair Tax Housing cooperative Manitoba Hydro Intermediate consumption Surplus value Islamic banking Assignment (law) Land reform Annuity United Kingdom corporation tax Public housing Short selling Irish Land Act Property (ownership right) SCO-Linux controversies Concurrent estate Blockbuster Video 2004 World Series Eviction Public domain Legal system of Hong Kong Hire purchase FairTax American individualist anarchism Guantanamo Bay Money Home repair Estoppel Title insurance Toyota Prius Property tax Neville Chamberlain Nuclear power STS-61 Explosive material Robert Walpole Free market Satchel Paige Copyright law of the United Kingdom B__rgerliches Gesetzbuch Downing Street memo Operating surplus Iran's nuclear program Stuyvesant Town Article One of the United States Constitution Enron Corporation History of the British constitution Economy of Nigeria Kitchen Autonomous building Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Squatting Common criticisms of Microsoft Option Thermal power station Home insurance Trademark Copyright infringement of software Economic rent Taxation in the United States Oakland Athletics Real estate bubble Central processing unit Apartment Asbestos Stock Karl Rove Anarchism and capitalism Gentrification Appeal

tax siezed homes i called my local county accessor today they told me that after someone wins an auction the person who won has to wait two years for the deed why does it take so long and is there a shorter process you are not winning the house when you get a tax lien you are only winning a lien against the proerty which is a legal debt that must be paid to you if during the next two years the property owner pays off the tax lien you will get the money plus the interest mandated by law or the auction this can be anywhere from to over depending on the state if it has not been paid within two years you will then have the option to foreclose on the property to enforce your lien if you are able to go through the foreclosure after paying the foreclosure costs then you will own the property then it becomes a tax siezed property although in some jurisdictions it doesn't end there in many states there is a further redemption perios where the original property owner can redemm the property back from you generally a month period by paying the tax lien and foreclosure costs plus interest many people go into tax liens as thinking that they will buy a property for while it does happen actually over of all tax lien properties are redeemed before foreclosure although in most places the interest rate often you get for these makes them a good investment you do need to do your homework though on the laws and redemptive rights of the original property owner before you become involved in investing in tax liens in a different county  Foreclosure Bond Allodial title Personal property Concurrent estate Insurance Tax Life insurance Leasing Capitalism Property tax Property (ownership right) Deflation (economics) Corporation Mechanics lien 401(k) Taxation in the United States Trust (Law) USA Microeconomics Estoppel Social Security (United States) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Money Annuity Title insurance Sheriff Gold standard Surplus value Capital accumulation Economy of Russia Gross domestic product Intellectual property FairTax Warren Buffett Fiat money Trademark Political subdivisions of New York State Keynesian economics Easement Eminent domain American individualist anarchism Tennessee State Constitution Monopoly (game) Government debt Flat tax Auction Real property Government of Maryland Personal finance Dividend Municipal bond Free trade Microcredit Government National Mortgage Association Interest Public domain Education in the United States Variable universal life insurance Anarchism and capitalism Donald Trump California Proposition 13 (1978) Divorce Great Depression United Kingdom corporation tax Politics of the United States Bankruptcy in the United States Credit card Treasury security Inflation Gambling Predatory lending Property law Short selling U.S. public debt Corporate governance Hyperinflation Fractional-reserve banking Islamic banking Health insurance Express trust Paul Martin Progressive tax Ponzi scheme Assignment (law) Public good Externality Capital gains tax Contract Food Stamp Program

i have two houses one about to go foreclosure i have two houses and im about to lose one because i cant pay it will the bank add the balance to the one im currently paying or what will happen i know i need to get in touch with the bank but wanted to get some input here please help if the two mortgages are somehow tied together i guess they could add one to the other but i have never heard of that in texas the norm is they file a lien on you for the shortfall after foreclosure that shortfall includes huge fees for legal issues and late charges it will save you thousands of dollars if you contact them and ask them to help you sell on a compromise sale or as some people call it a short sale if you can't do that for some reason then explore signing the house back to them directly so that you at least avoid the expense of a foreclosure other states may have far different laws and you should talk to a lawyer to find out what would be best for you  Foreclosure Predatory lending Allodial title ACORN Life insurance Taxation in the United States Deflation (economics) Credit card Citigroup Plame affair FairTax Mutual fund Bank Insurance Personal finance Euro Enron Corporation Mergers and acquisitions Government National Mortgage Association Great Depression SCO-Linux controversies Value added tax Wheel of Fortune Concurrent estate Leasing Lawyer Copyright Monsanto Title insurance 401(k) Social Security debate (United States) Social Security (United States) Bretton Woods system Software patent debate Intellectual property Islamic banking Copyleft Israeli settlement Trust (Law) USA History of the United States Constitution Tom DeLay Internet fraud Read my lips: no new taxes Dave Ramsey Wal-Mart Karl Rove Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Bond Legal tender United Kingdom corporation tax Real estate broker ROC presidential election, 2004 Supreme Court of the United States Microcredit Child support Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Short selling Supply and demand TLC Barrister PNG Student loan 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Password Personal property Ponzi scheme Security (finance) Gold standard Microeconomics CPU cache Automatic teller machine London Congestion Charge Tax Housing cooperative MMORPG Democratic Party (United States) Capital accumulation Donald Trump Pretty Good Privacy Law of costs John F.

where in line can i get a mortgage lease on line to ensure i will get my rent from my tenants for sometime now my husband's family have our property for some home group business this people haven't paid rent to us every sense this whole thing started and they have the house on foreclosure so many times i decided to make this legal and demanded rent is being more than four years and they haven't gave us nothing out of this business but bad credit i demanded rent enough to pay the mortgage on time and some for us i need to make a legal contract that obligates them to pay us rent sense this house is in my husbands name this way we would pay our own mortgage and the house won't be in foreclosure again this people they are bad people they don't care about our needs they say we don't deserve money out of the business because we didn't invest any money in the business but haven't being for my husband signature they would not have a business so they refuse to pay rent i know i could take this to court and i will but first i need a mortagage lease where can i find one it sounds to me that the first problem is that you have no written instruments with these renters if so the law provides for you to evict them and sue for back rent if indeed there is no written lease in place they are month to month tenants and as such all states that i know of require you to give them a day notice to vacate the premises then if they do not vacate you will be required to sue them in magistrate court or district court for a writ of restitution eviction payment of back rent and damages caused you for having to take this action after the judge signs the orders then if they do not vacate you take the order to the sheriff and they will remove the tenants if they do not pay the amounts stipulated in the judge's order you will need to reduce your judgement to a collection by asking the court to order so and you can collect your money through various ways including garnishment of any wages of the tenant best of luck to you  Leasehold estate Mortgage Eviction Appeal Estoppel Contract Concurrent estate Rental agreement Leasing Divorce Babylonian law American individualist anarchism Article One of the United States Constitution Taxation in the United States Great Depression Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Allodial title Squatting Housing cooperative ACORN Judiciary of Hong Kong Theory of conduct Renting Property (ownership right) Deflation (economics) Foreclosure Child support Waste (law) Islamic banking Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 FairTax Government National Mortgage Association Monopoly (game) Intellectual property Unemployment Sheriff Money Terri Schiavo Life insurance Property tax Capitalism Annuity Microeconomics Scots law Barrister Student loan Tort Public housing 2005 trial of Michael Jackson New Hampshire Supreme Court Capital accumulation Negligence Thomas de Littleton Charles I of England Schabir Shaik Trial Debt Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Same-sex marriage in the United States Economy of Russia Supreme Court of the United States Interest Anarcho-capitalism National Kidney Foundation Singapore Civil rights Government of Maryland Fixtures Parliament of the United Kingdom Minimum wage Bailiff 613 mitzvot Manorialism CPU cache Copyright Personal finance Royal Assent Eminent domain New Deal Domestic partnerships in California Grover Cleveland Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Public good Surplus value Notary public Rosa Parks Legal fiction National Football League Derivative (finance) Trust (Law) USA Public policy

should my mom rent her house out in ca or sell it my mom who's and on a fixed income is currently living with me in boise waiting for her house to sell in northern california she wants to have her own place but is kind of in limbo right now because of the market some family members think she should just rent it out and wait for the market to turn around which i know may take a while instead of selling it for what she would get for it right now her home is paid for so she could afford to lower her price and still pay cash for one here there are a ton of homes flooding the market here in boise too so she could still get a great deal on a home here eventually as well if she rents it out she would have to rent something for herself here when the market does turn around and she was to sell then wouldn't she lose a big chunk of it to taxes anyways if it was rented out longer than years thanks for any advice she would not earn a profit from it the rent she gets would have to pay her rent here by the way my mom is way into her health is isn't going anywhere for a long time my parents are in the same situation in southern ca and they want to move out of state to be near me so i've been doing lots of research as far as taxes are concerned she could have a capital gains tax exclusion even if she rented but she'd have to sell it within years to qualify in the years prior to the sale of the house you need to have lived in the house for at least months in that year period it sounds like your mom is single or widowed so she'd get up to k profit untaxed it's k for married folks if she refinanced her house in ca and took some money out to put down on a house in boise she could rent out the ca home the rent would cover the refinaced amount of money and i'm assuming her mortgage payment in boise be sure to save some money for unexpected troubles plumbing a c roof etc if you go this route i'd recommend getting a property management company to take care of the ca home trying to be a landlord out of state is not going to be easy of course mgmt is going to take a portion of the rent too so do your math to see if this works out for your mom the easiest thing is to sell now but if you're willing to do a little work it could mean a huge difference in profits good luck to you and your mom  Insurance Mortgage Taxation in the United States Life insurance Microeconomics Bond FairTax Tax Monopoly (game) Capital accumulation Economic rent Leasehold estate Warren Buffett Annuity Progressive tax Capitalism Productive and unproductive labour Economy of Russia Real estate bubble Property tax Money Islamic banking Housing cooperative Flat tax Babylonian law Intellectual property Great Depression Income statement Leasing Renting Profit Value added Health insurance Divorce Credit card Keynesian economics Estoppel Derivative (finance) Treasury security Variable universal life insurance Privatization Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Bank Mergers and acquisitions Investment bank PE ratio Intermediate consumption Illegal drug trade Health care in the United States Poker jargon Airline Public policy Public housing Dividend Mortgage-backed security Debt Primerica Financial Services Economy of the United States Gold standard Labor theory of value American individualist anarchism Prostitution in Germany Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Public good Article One of the United States Constitution Citigroup 401(k) Price discrimination Law of value Arbitrage Monetary policy First-sale doctrine Publicly funded medicine Value product Copyright Donald Trump Rent (musical) UK Singles Chart Social Security (United States) Security (finance) Euro Capital gains tax Trust (Law) USA My Little Pony

how does house flipping work i love watching these shows about house flipping i see the headaches and problems they encounter but still seem to think it would be fun and a great way to make money what i can't figure out is how seemingly ordinary people i e not already rich can afford their own residence while also buying another house and sinking as much as k in renovations into it if you already own your own home do you just go to the bank and get another home loan i would think the bank wouldn't approve such a risky venture at first and even if you do get approved how do people get in liquid cash to be able to do the renovation i just don't undertand i can understand how someone does it if they have investors lots of personal money or know construction workers who can do the work for cheap but for others flipping who are doing their first house how do they do this that's why a lot of these have teams who do this three or four get together often including a real estate agent who can scout for and sell the properties a money person accountant banker or mortgage broker who can arrange financing a contractor type to supervise do the actual work and often a money partner a person like a doctor or lawyer with money they need to invest normally at least one and preferably several need good credit to pull off the financing almost all of these scenarios involve the flipping investor s to get temporary financing which is normally at a high interest rate this gets them going for a few months while they do the renovations that is one reason they are often talking about getiing things done quickly and worrying about delays every day delayed costs them hundreds if not thousands of dollars there is a lot of profit in these things but if you get over your head or delayed or the renovations go over budget you can easily lose money there are other ways to do it sometimes you can buy from a bank reo real estate owned department and they will be so happy to sell they will provide financing also the va has a program for investors of their va foreclosed homes they have a vender financing proghram where anyone including nonvets can buy foreclosed homes with little down at a good rate and no worry about credit scores all ou have to do is show proof you have income to pay the mortgage those who will live in the house can get a loan for zero down investors the same but down you can get a streamlined loan process for down good luck  Deflation (economics) Bank Insurance Bond Citigroup Economy of Russia Islamic banking Construction Gross domestic product Money Derivative (finance) Finance Capital accumulation Security (finance) Donald Trump Annuity Stock Government National Mortgage Association Life insurance Mergers and acquisitions Capitalism Economy of the United States Investment bank Monetary policy Microcredit Predatory lending Real estate developer Gold standard Short selling FairTax Corporate finance Federal National Mortgage Association Financial markets Universal Studios Corporation Privatization Warren Buffett Bretton Woods system Surplus value Real estate broker PE ratio Financial services Great Depression Charles Ponzi Interest Hyperinflation Personal finance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Student loan Toronto-Dominion Bank Money supply Economy of Nigeria Real estate economics Enron Corporation History of the United States (1918-1945) Margin (finance) Sears Holdings Corporation Inflation Yield curve Advance fee fraud Concurrent estate Anarchism and capitalism Bulk vending Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Primerica Financial Services Usury Cooperative Economy of Cuba Taxation in the United States Tax Arbitrage Credit card Bank fraud Dividend Supply-side economics Savings and Loan crisis Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Ponzi scheme Berkshire Hathaway NASDAQ U.S. public debt Central bank Savings and loan association Government debt Monopoly (game) MMORPG Housing cooperative Coalition Provisional Authority Law of value Timeline of the Enron scandal

i took a class on state tax liens on homes can the average investor make good money on tax liens the class told us all we needed was two hours a week for a large fee the company would stear us to the best liens do i need this company or could i obtain good liens on the internet for free almost all of these online website won't do you any good they sell knowledge for huge fees that you can get on your own with a little sweat in fact this is an area where doing your own research introduces you to the major players and gives you valuable resources these internet sites can never give the question is what state to work in in some states the interest you get and restrictions on foreclosing on property are very bad for the investor so you want to avoid those other places like california florida and texas are excellent but there are thousands of investors who flock there expecially the big counties where there are lots of properties in some places like dade county florida banks and financial corporations show up and buy millions of dollars of tax liens for investments if you can it is best to work your own state in your own county and the counties around you it is best if you know the area and have a sense of property values i've seen people buy tax liens and foreclose to get the property only to find it was a toxic waste dump so you have to do your research on what you are bidding on most tax liens go through the counties so you can contact your local county to find out how it works what are the legalities and where the tax liens sale are held only a very few places hold their tax lien sales on line but many counties do provide websites that announce lien sales and list the properties that are expected to be available most counties hold tax lien sales either every or months so if you work several counties you could be going to tax lien sales times a year another good advice is to go to your first tax lien sale without wanting to bid just observe get a feel for what things sell for and what the process is then on the next one register as a bidder and get your feet wet good luck  Mutual fund Mortgage Donald Trump Foreclosure Mergers and acquisitions Temasek Holdings MMORPG Microeconomics Capital accumulation Corporation Investment bank Auction Bank FairTax Capitalism Warren Buffett Internet fraud Economy of Russia Insurance Bond Tesco Security (finance) Wal-Mart Privatization Construction Hedge fund Finance SCO-Linux controversies Education in the United States Taxation in the United States Advance fee fraud Credit card Allodial title Citigroup London Congestion Charge Software patent debate Free trade Life insurance Gold as an investment Michael Milken Stock Short selling Berkshire Hathaway Microsoft ITV National Kidney Foundation Singapore MG Rover Group Surplus value Poker jargon America Online ROC presidential election, 2004 Tax Monopoly (game) Electronic commerce Personal property Neopets Property (ownership right) Politics of the Republic of China Kuomintang Trademark The Standard Income trust Productive and unproductive labour Asian financial crisis Universal Studios $ale of the Century Supply and demand Unreformed House of Commons Make money fast Ford Motor Company UK Singles Chart Minimum wage Municipal bond Dividend Bretton Woods system Concurrent estate Mikhail Khodorkovsky Economy of the United States Capital gains tax Erling Dekke N__ss Air New Zealand Nintendo United Kingdom corporation tax Anarchism and capitalism YUKOS Copyright Hyperinflation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Corporate governance Lottery Contract bridge Expert system Canadian and American economies compared Commodore International Galactic Civilizations Bank fraud

rental agreements after june i thought my tenancy had become month to month but now that i am trying to move out my landlord says that my lease is year to year so i cannot move out until the end of the new lease even thought at the end of my lease he never gave me another lease he told me to read my lease and this is what it says this agreement will in effect from june until june unless renewed or extended pursuant to the terms herein and is based on a yearly term last year on sept he raised my rent but now i am thinking if my lease is year to year he had no right to raise my rent because on june we had entered into a new year of the contract so i feel that i have been overpaying him rent and now want to sue him for the overpayments am i rigth laws vary from state to state so for any of us to really comment is great and a starting point but in the end you are going to have to talk to a lawyer if i was you i would just move and let him keep my security deposit he might take you to debtor's court you can appear for your self and the judge will assist you in your case i really don't think that he would file in most states to extend a lease one must sign a new lease the facts as stated above doesn't indicate a open ended lease there by the lease would extend on a month to month basis i would fill the squares i would give him notice that i was going to move and that i expected my deposit returned to me once the inspection is done clean it really well and take photos of every thing if he says you are locked in to another year tell point blank show me where i have signed another lease he no doubt is going to say i told you before to read your lease say i have and there is nothing that says i can't move you then tell him that you are going to file suit and very well may file criminal charges against him for fraud he has done this to other folks along and has gotten away with it so he figures that he can do this to anyone an additional thought come to mine keep a short diary of events dates and conversations with him if he says that he is going to take you to court tell that is fine and i will counter and pray for the overage that you have been charging me and court costs i would then give him my new address i will also tell you that when you go hunting for another place to live tell the new landlord what is going on if you don't he might call this guy and ask about you we both know that your landlord is a a hole and will do what ever to keep you there so he isn't going to say anything nice about you  Leasing Plame affair Rental agreement Contract Estoppel Public domain Babylonian law Appeal Eviction Schabir Shaik Trial Karl Rove Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Barrister Trademark United Kingdom corporation tax Property (ownership right) Lawsuit First-sale doctrine International Criminal Court Judiciary of Hong Kong Annuity 2005 trial of Michael Jackson 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Islamic banking Intellectual property Conspiracy Enron Corporation Copyright Article One of the United States Constitution Lawyer SCO-Linux controversies W.

what is the difference between rent and lease what is the difference between rent and lease kindly enlighten the circumstances under which the rent is used and under what circumstances the lease is used kindly educate me with the examples and illustrations with legal positions when you rent out a property you will need to decide if you wish to offer your tenants a lease or a rental agreement although these terms are often used interchangeably they are not the same a lease for a rental property has a finite term such as six months or a year for which a tenant will agree to rent the property during this time period also known as the duration of the lease the tenant and the landlord are bound to uphold the terms of the written agreement having a lease means that neither party may change any terms of the agreement until the lease expires unless both parties agree to the change for example if the current amount of rent is per month you may not increase this amount until the lease expires under a lease tenants are obligated to make monthly rent payments as agreed upon as well as follow any code of conduct or other stipulations in the lease while it's in effect it also means that a tenant may not vacate the property without breaking their lease in some cases the tenant may be held liable for the remaining amount of rent due under the lease or they may be required to find another person to fulfill their end of the lease a lease is generally used for landlords who prefer the stability that comes with locking in a tenant for a specified period of time if you have a mortgage payment to meet having this set amount of income can help you budget your expenses most tenants are familiar with long term leases and will not have a problem committing rental agreements differ from leases in a number of ways standard rental agreements are month to month and there is no set period of residence both the landlord and tenant are free at the end of each day period to make changes to the rental agreement subject to any rent control laws these changes may include a rent increase modification of terms of the rental agreement or a request to vacate the property however in most states both landlord and tenant are required to give days' notice before any changes can be made if your state does not require a notice you are free to change any part of the rental agreement at your discretion rental agreements are useful for landlords who are having difficulty attracting new tenants especially if they are in areas that cater to students or professionals on the move they appreciate the freedom a month to month agreement provides and landlords who offer these arrangements may have an edge over landlords who require long term leases a rental agreement is typically auto renewed without notice after each day period has elapsed as long as neither party has stated that the tenant will vacate the premises before you rent out your property you will need to take into account the differences between a lease and a rental agreement this will allow you to make the best decision for your needs  Eviction Estoppel Concurrent estate Housing cooperative Waste (law) United Kingdom corporation tax Intellectual property Insurance Microeconomics Renting Public domain Mortgage Annuity Property (ownership right) Divorce Treaty Barrister Babylonian law American individualist anarchism Islamic banking Copyright law of the United Kingdom Life insurance Trust (Law) USA Taxation in the United States Real property Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Article One of the United States Constitution Copyright Monopoly (game) Capitalism Anarchism and capitalism Education in the United States United States Constitution Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Serfdom Eminent domain Judiciary of Hong Kong Property tax Modding Student loan New Hampshire Supreme Court Standard form contract Public-key cryptography Domestic partnerships in California Child support Intermediate consumption Squatting FairTax Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Bond Negligence Bretton Woods system International law Patent Free trade Allodial title Rent control Kyoto Protocol President of Germany Economy of Russia Geolibertarianism Copyright infringement of software Personal finance European Convention on Human Rights Credit card Same-sex marriage in Canada Thomas de Littleton Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Unreformed House of Commons Slander and libel Land reform Apartment building Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India SCO-Linux controversies Passport Bailment Football (soccer) Consensus decision-making Gentrification French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools International Criminal Court Economic rent Harlem Euro Board of Cooperative Educational Services International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict Poker jargon

bad credit home loans my wife and i want to get out of our apartment in febuary but we did a debt relief program that we are still in and will be in in feb we both have terrible credit now under is it possible to get a home loan we are going to hope fully buy in the k range any advice would help with the current state of the market it will be almost impossible to predict what will be available to you in february i will however give you some advice and a little inside info the amount of money you can stash away for a down payment should be your top priority in your case you will need one the more you put away the better your chances of getting a loan your lender will require that you have some down payment usually down and you will probably need a little help there are lenders out there that will lend up to to of the purchase price of a home at a very high interest rate if you are lucky you might even get up to but that depends if those lenders are still around in february you will also have to ask the seller to carry a note for the amount you can't cover with the loan and the down payment we'll take the worst case scenario other than being flat out turned down you get a loan for of the purchase price that would be about in your case you have down hopefully which is you would ask the seller to do a seller carried second mortgage this means that the seller would be willing to take payments on the remaining balance at a certain interest rate over a certain term in the form of a second mortgage usually or years best case probably is you get financing that would mean that your seller would only have to do a seller carried second mortgage everything else stays the same so every month you would have mortgage payments one to the institutional lender on your first mortgage and the second to the seller on your second mortgage impossible you would be surprised it happens all the time and most of the nation is looking at a tremendous buyers market so sellers are willing to get very creative you could also do whats called a lease to own they are usually heavily in the sellers favor but can be used to puchase a home there is also what are called wrap around mortgages that allow you to pay an actual mortgage payment every month without having to get a institutional loan in many states they actually allow you to be on title when the transaction is complete many counties cities and non profit organizations have what are called down payment assistance programs they will loan you funds to purchase a home and in some cases the loans do not have to be repaid if those are not viable then there is always acorn housing i attached the link be sure to check with your attorney or a good mortgage broker in your area since laws very from state to state hope this helps  Student loan Short selling Security (finance) Government National Mortgage Association Financial markets Debt Deflation (economics) Gold standard Stock Monetary policy Money Credit card Federal National Mortgage Association Title insurance FairTax Bretton Woods system Economy of the United States Savings and loan association Citigroup Derivative (finance) Government debt Mutual fund Great Depression Real estate bubble Annuity Money supply Economy of Russia Life insurance Mortgage-backed security Economy of Pakistan Credit derivative Tax Capitalism History of the United States (1918-1945) Supply and demand Microeconomics Usury Leasing Annual percentage rate Internet fraud Primerica Financial Services Microcredit Central bank Unconscionability Arbitrage Islamic economics Hyperinflation ACORN Intellectual property Subsidy Housing cooperative 401(k) Stock market Financial services Municipal bond Gross domestic product Marshall Plan Price discrimination Call option Donald Trump Rational pricing Collateralized mortgage obligation Conveyancing United Kingdom corporation tax Taxation in the United States Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Free trade Bank fraud Interest rate Mergers and acquisitions History of post-Soviet Russia Surplus value Real estate Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Economic relations of Japan Collateralized debt obligation Inflation Personal finance Wells Fargo Credit score Social Security (United States) Payday loan Babylonian law Temasek Holdings Privatization

rent in california please help understand the law i have had an oral agreement to rent an appartment i have completed an application and made a security deposit i have not signed a lease agreement for this place yet because i was not sure if it was a right place for me my move in date was later in the month now i have found another place which is great and i want to get back my security deposit from the previous place which i do not want to rent anymore what are my rights thank you very much for advise it was just about a week since i orally agreed to rent the place and i was not even supposed to move in until later in the month why should i be liable for month rent the security deposit is a security to the landlord to have him take the apartment off the market for you the thing is it depends on what was signed and receipted as whether it is a refundable or a nonrefundable deposit if nothing was specified in writing most area laws would automatically consider it a refundable deposit however some states would consider that a nonrefundable because the owner did something for you took the home off the market check your receipt and application to see if there is any mention of a nonrefundable deposit if there is none then you should inform the landlord and ask for the deposit back of course the landlord will feel stiffed by you understandably so the problem with operating like this is that you make people feel you used them and wasted their time in their mind they could have been looking for someone who was serious about renting from them so they will not do anything more than they absolutely have to do for you be prepared for the owner to fight you on this they will feel they are morally in the right even if you are legally in the right  Leasehold estate Leasing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Estoppel Octopus card Housing cooperative Mortgage Taxation in the United States Credit card Contract Intellectual property Annuity Public domain Rent control First-sale doctrine Property (ownership right) Renting Cyprus dispute Insurance Hire purchase Copyright Stuyvesant Town Patent Chatham Square Blackburn Rovers F.C.

general contracting advise are there any good tips or guidelines to stick to when hiring or dealing with a contractor when renovating a home how is the best way to keep a good repore with a contractor to make sure he keeps up his side of the deal i e shows up on time completes projects on time and on budget what kind of thing do i want to avoid saying to a contractor that would make him not want to take on the job i already know that i should interview and get estimates from reputible contractors that are registered with bbb and make my decision based on that but what is to follow i want to make sure that i don't have to hire multiple companies to do the same job due to any problems with a contractor after you check with the bbb make sure to check with the contractors licensing board to make sure that no complaints have been filed on the contractor also it is very important that the scope of work is detailed other wise you will be paying extra cost under change orders submitted by your contractor if you want to save some money it is best to subcontract parts of the work so lets say you need the kitchen remodeled move some walls electrical plumbing drywall cabinets painting etc the carpentry demolition drywall plumbing and electrical can be given to the contractor but the cabinets you can have another contractor perform along with painting its a little more work for you but the savings can be substantial as most contractors only self perform portions of work and subcontract out the rest on which the charge you is added to your bill so depending on your cash situation this could be something to consider  Construction The Apprentice 2 CPU cache Coalition Provisional Authority National Health Service Unemployment ITV SCO-Linux controversies Compiler optimization Oil-for-Food Programme FairTax Spring operating system Insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Poker jargon Mach kernel Crew Exploration Vehicle Wal-Mart Extreme Programming Microeconomics Bulk vending Advance fee fraud Home repair Theory of conduct Electricity meter Sweatshop Risk management Medicare (Canada) IPod Dynamic Systems Development Method Mutual fund Drill bit Corporate finance CPU design Computer 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Information Services Procurement Library Public domain F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Better Business Bureau Space Shuttle program United States Postal Service United Kingdom corporation tax Drug test Winter of Discontent Betting (poker) Table saw Seismic retrofit Government of France Gross domestic product C programming language Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina SAS System C plus plus Copyleft Internet fraud Florida Central Voter File Presidential system Pretty Good Privacy Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Raytheon Copyright law of the United Kingdom Affirmative action Work for hire Commodity markets Life insurance Appeal Redundant array of independent disks Solar cell Value added tax Health insurance Economy of the United States Contract Software patent debate Drywall Classified information Bruce Johnson Baseball Richmond-Airport-Vancouver Line Marshall Plan Equine conformation Home improvement Labour economics Virtual memory Collision detection Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Karl Rove Principal-agent problem Child support Bank Kitchen Schabir Shaik Trial Central processing unit Efficiency wages Bechtel Corporation

sellers did not go for st appt for sale of hdb unit what are the legal financial consequences property agent did not wait for hle letter and rushed the sellers to sign the unconditional otp without even giving them time to think for days the hle was rejected bacause sellers cannot move from rm to rm and the sellers back out from st appt because they are currently serving bank loan fluctuating and hefty and they do not want to go for second one they only decided to sell after being convinced by the agent about their eligibility to sell a rm and buy a rm all the while the agent had been giving wrong infos misguiding and misrepresenting facts sellers had been busy in work and study so had given complete responsibility to her trusting her they just complied following her instructions without doubting her a bit the case was mishandled and it all happened due to the agents negligience the buyers have sent a legal letter to complete the deal the agency is not helping and suggesting to carry on with the sale but through bank loan please advice and suggest options it is impossible to give any reasonable answer what advice do you need are you the buyer are you the buyer's agent are you a terciary party seller of the second property or assuming you are the buyer then it sounds like there was a deal pressed together with the flimsiest of grounds and it has toppled i have never yet seen an unconditional otp ever through a real estate agent the forms they use are chock full of outs and conditions for instance with the hle if the otp was based on an hle that is a general agreement but you still have to agree on the details of the hle if the two parties do not agree to the details then there us no deal you can try to force the sellers to sell under the original terms but you would have a huge amount of court time involved in taking them to court and getting a judge to agree with you i would suggest that if you can do bank financing do it if you can't start looking for another deal if you are not the buyer then say what your standing is so people can give appropriate advice either way good luck  Contract Real estate broker Islamic banking Mortgage Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Life insurance Microeconomics Internet fraud Security (finance) Capitalism Option Short selling Economics Trademark Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Debt Appeal Scots law SCO-Linux controversies Stock Babylonian law Tax Trust (Law) USA Royal Assent Insider trading Warranty Student loan Price discrimination Surplus value Gold standard Futures contract Divorce Investment bank Theory of conduct Supreme Court of the United States Consideration Coercion Hire purchase Mediation International Criminal Court Arbitrage Call option Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 7 Annuity Leasing Deflation (economics) Conveyancing Intellectual property Patent Civil unions in the United Kingdom One-time pad Financial markets Money Schabir Shaik Trial Derivative (finance) Australian constitutional law Citigroup Standard form contract Bank fraud Privatization United Kingdom corporation tax Causality Mutual fund Inventory Monetary policy Capital accumulation 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Estoppel Polyamory Property (ownership right) Housing cooperative Enron Corporation Jury GNU General Public License Real estate Law of the People's Republic of China Poker jargon Agency (law) Advance fee fraud Epistemology Consensus decision-making Same-sex marriage in Canada Unlawful combatant Free market Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Sales UK Singles Chart Put option President of Germany Productive and unproductive labour Copyright Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal

is rent to own a house a good idea it can be since you can usually set the purchase price now even though you won't actually buy until later be sure that your contract clearly indicates what amount of your rent will be applied as a down payment and be aware that lenders will only consider the amount paid over typical rents in the area as down payment keep good records for your future mortgage application it is also a good idea to talk to a local mortgage broker or bank now since you want to be sure you will qualify for a loan when the time comes have an attorney look over the paperwork as well good luck  Mortgage Insurance Bond Islamic banking Title insurance Real estate bubble Short selling Predatory lending Bank Housing cooperative Taxation in the United States Interest Monopoly (game) Mutual fund Life insurance Debt Deflation (economics) Money Student loan Federal National Mortgage Association Financial markets Monetary policy Savings and loan association Derivative (finance) Islamic economics Anarchism and capitalism Annuity Intellectual property Renting Finance Personal finance Leasing Estoppel Collateralized mortgage obligation Annual percentage rate Government National Mortgage Association Stamp duty Inflation Microeconomics Citigroup Interest rate History of the United States (1918-1945) Economic rent Subsidy Health insurance Mobile home Security (finance) Primerica Financial Services Home insurance Corporation Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Futures contract Wells Fargo First-sale doctrine 401(k) Margin (finance) Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Payday loan Mortgage-backed security FairTax ACORN Social Credit Supply and demand Auto insurance Babylonian law Central bank Mergers and acquisitions Gold standard Irish Property Bubble Harlem Los Angeles Clippers Donald Trump Conveyancing Gross domestic product American individualist anarchism Capital accumulation Economy of the United States Rental agreement Government debt Foreclosure Real estate Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Tax Concurrent estate Commodity markets Leasehold estate Allodial title Copyright Credit card Internet fraud Credit score Value added Construction Economics British residential property market Capitalism Publicly funded medicine

if sellers make counter offer a house listed as i made an offer of and the seller pays closing prepaids today i not sure if she heard through the grapevine or not that the sellers are going to offer to pay half of the closing costs only and counter that is fairly reasonable to me but it's not quite where i need to be to feel comfortable w the monthly payments etc i have financing on loan can i negotiate w the mortgage company for a lower rate also what is a good counter offer to the sellers counter offer actually this was questions thanks for your replies for one thing you need to set a limit that you can live with in other words with closing costs etc at what amount is it that you are comfortable with the loan at this time most mortgages are going at around but money is getting very tight in fact the central bank is pumping a lot of money into the economy right now so that the mortgage market doesn't go nuts so you can shop around and you might get a lower rate but right now i would simply assume i can get the if that rate has been guaranteed by the lender so i would just work with the make the amount you need to be at your top price now assuming the price is somewhere between seller pay all and seller pay i would counter half way between the amount you need with seller paying and and seller let's say that number you must have is seller pays all costs ideally i would still insist on seller paying of costs but you raise your price a bit and for an odd number like seller pays all closing costs let the real estate agent know you are right at your limit chances are the seller will accept but even if they counter they will know you are at your limit if they counter again recounter at seller pays for all costs etc which is only a fraction more if they want to sell they will if they deadlock and refuse your offer then you can give in with a big show of desperation for or hope this helps  Mortgage Insurance Supply and demand Real estate broker Microeconomics Interest Bond Short selling Deflation (economics) Capitalism Islamic banking Government National Mortgage Association Financial markets Price discrimination Economics Monetary policy Debt Security (finance) Student loan Gold standard Life insurance Federal National Mortgage Association Predatory lending FairTax Contract Annual percentage rate Credit card Surplus value Title insurance Unconscionability Mutual fund Inflation Mortgage-backed security Money Stock Tax Subsidy Annuity Primerica Financial Services Capital accumulation Economy of Russia Option Derivative (finance) Bretton Woods system Supply-side economics Tariff Monopoly Real estate bubble Federal Reserve Central bank Gross domestic product Value added tax Real estate Taxation in the United States Intellectual property Keynesian economics Usury Donald Trump Privatization Social Credit Money supply History of the United States (1918-1945) Housing cooperative Futures contract Monopoly (game) Poker jargon 401(k) Arbitrage United Kingdom corporation tax Rational pricing MMORPG Economy of the United States Conveyancing Call option Personal finance Airline U.S. public debt Salary cap Blackjack Law of value Internet fraud Final Fantasy XI Interest rate Collateralized mortgage obligation Economy of Chile Stock market Common Agricultural Policy Anarchism and capitalism Citigroup Corporation Great Depression New Deal Wal-Mart Euro

world market slump and me what effects will the current world market slump have on mortgages i am applying for one to buy a house for the first time the current mortgage market has become very strict in regards to qualifying for a mortgage as a result of the high number of foreclosures nation wide lenders are requiring borrowers to have higher credit score or come to the table with more money if you don't it is still a good time to buy we are in a buyers market because interest rates are still low prices have gotten softer inventory is high therefore there are more homes to choose from and sellers are more willing to negotiate it is best that you speak with a reputable lender regarding the loan options available to you and the type of loan that will work best for your situation http www actionjacksonhomes com  Mortgage Predatory lending Bond Financial markets Interest Government National Mortgage Association Real estate bubble Great Depression Real estate broker Deflation (economics) Life insurance Bank Supply and demand Insurance Monetary policy Usury Central bank Finance Islamic banking Derivative (finance) Security (finance) Mortgage-backed security Annual percentage rate Title insurance Subsidy Microeconomics FairTax Futures contract Rational pricing Short selling Privatization Gold standard Money Corporate finance Money supply Foreclosure Price discrimination Asian financial crisis Taxation in the United States Credit card Gross domestic product Debt consolidation Inflation Real estate Argentine Currency Board Call option Economics Repurchase agreement Economy of Russia Unconscionability Mergers and acquisitions Annuity Microcredit Bretton Woods system Supply-side economics Yield curve Monopoly Mobile home Lender of last resort Hyperinflation Housing cooperative Margin (finance) Business cycle Monopoly (game) Technical analysis Stock market Ford Motor Company Citigroup Economy of Pakistan 401(k) Internet fraud Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Savings and loan association Commodity markets Contract Commodity Labour economics Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Payday loan Mutual fund Tax Collateralized mortgage obligation Federal Reserve Keynesian economics Put option Personal finance Economic relations of Japan Economy of India

question about buying a flipped house the seller bought the house in april for they maybe put into fixing it up and now want to sell for is this justified can i lowball and get a much better price houses in the area sell for about less and in response to the person who said that they thought this price was low and should have asked for more you are an asshole and do not know what you're talking about it turns out that the owner of the house owns rental properties across the city the average price of a house sold in the area is it has been listed since april and the seller originally posted it for but changed it after only week hi if comps are k less than the that they are asking you can counter with a lower offer but the flipper is into the house for at least before you calculate in his closing costs on both sides of the deal and holding costs for a couple of months so based on market values no the price isnt justified even if they have done a gorgeous rehab job the neighborhood is not going to support the price if the true value of the property is and they are into it for they the flippers have screwed up because they are going to have a hard time selling it at the price they need to get to make the deal worthwhile as an investor i would go find another deal if i was an end user and really liked the house i would offer and see what they counter with but i wouldnt spend a lot of time on it the flippers need to get more than market value on the house they are better off holding if they can make it cashflow as a rental or they may be able to get close to the price they need if they offer owner financing on it if you are not in love with the house and they dont accept the offer look for a better deal they are out there best of luck to you barbara www therealestatebirddog com  Supply and demand Microeconomics Technical analysis Capitalism Mutual fund Economics Short selling Stock Mortgage Futures contract Leasing Warren Buffett Wal-Mart Real estate broker Stock market SCO-Linux controversies Price discrimination FairTax MMORPG PE ratio Airline Inflation Monetary policy Security (finance) Bond Berkshire Hathaway Google Temasek Holdings First-sale doctrine Economy of Russia AMD Enron Corporation Gold as an investment Poker jargon Tax Commodore International ITunes Music Store Ford Motor Company Capital accumulation Supply-side economics Day trading Illegal drug trade United Kingdom corporation tax Eircom Donald Trump Labor theory of value Derivative (finance) Atari 8-bit family Internet fraud Citigroup Monopoly (game) Islamic banking Hyperinflation Transformation problem Blackjack Consumption of fixed capital Externality Rational pricing Economy of the United States Air New Zealand Law of value Margin (finance) American individualist anarchism Surplus value Insurance __lectricit__ de France Estoppel Betting (poker) Tesco Extreme Programming Economic inequality Property tax IPod Economic rent Interest Modern portfolio theory General aviation Yield curve Amway Deflation (economics) Public housing Debt Laptop Inventory Intellectual property The Apprentice 2 Credit derivative Goodness and value theory Wealth MG Rover Group Nintendo GameCube

exiting a commercial lease early will affect my real property how my ex general partners want to close the business and exit the lease early i am still on the lease with them i have tried to get off of the lease but the landlord won't allow it because my partners have no assets therefore they are a greater risk i listed all of my assets on the lease agreement which us partners personally signed my main question is can i lose my condos over this if yes how what happens can i claim bankruptcy if i do will i lose my condos or will i be able to keep them will i need to hire a lawyer how will i pay my lawyer with what money the business is not making any money the partners do not have money for next month's rent your main question is can you lose your condo's over this no the worst that'll happen with the condo's is that a lien may be placed on one of them only after a judgment against you which would have to be paid at the point of selling the condo if you file bankruptcy will you lose them no bankruptcy destroys your credit but it protects your property at this time of a record number of foreclosures there is also a record number of bankruptcies from people stopping the mortgage companies from taking their homes away from them i will tell you that the landlord has a responsibility to mitigate the damages meaning he must make every reasonable effort to re lease the property he must run ads post signs show the property to perspective tenants and not turn away qualified tenants once the land lord does re lease the property you are only on the hook for the amount of time that the property sat vacant not for the duration of your lease if he can not find a new tenant you are on the hook for the balance of your lease the previous answer was sound that the company should consult an attorney but only regarding the dissolution of a corporation not even a good lawyer will get you out of a lease unless you can demonstrate that the property became inhabitable causing you to move your partners should be jointly liable but the landlord can sue who they wish and it's you that have the assets so if you're the only one sued and you lose you would then have to sue your partners to recover their fair share of the damages  Mortgage Leasehold estate Leasing Insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus SCO-Linux controversies Capitalism Concurrent estate Divorce Intellectual property Islamic banking Corporation Housing cooperative United Kingdom corporation tax Waste (law) Taxation in the United States Software patent debate Bond Eviction Deflation (economics) Appeal Trademark Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Capital accumulation Wal-Mart Lawyer Babylonian law Donald Trump Debt Timeline of the Enron scandal Trust (Law) USA Schabir Shaik Trial Property (ownership right) Allodial title Bankruptcy Oakland Athletics Article One of the United States Constitution Rental agreement Domestic partnerships in California Irish Land Act Liability Medical malpractice Slander and libel Security (finance) Contract 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Condominium United Airlines Derivative (finance) Surplus value Microeconomics Interest Stamp duty Anarchism and capitalism Asbestos Mutual fund Citigroup Property law Airline Commodore International Delta Air Lines Sears Holdings Corporation Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code Los Angeles Clippers Asian financial crisis Great Depression Law firm Mikhail Khodorkovsky Wealth American individualist anarchism Renting Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Mortgage-backed security Title insurance Bankruptcy in the United States Real property Tort reform Fixtures Lawsuit Foreclosure Pacific, Missouri Warren Buffett BAE Systems Incorporation (business) Free trade Labor theory of value Personal finance Bruce Johnson Video game crash of 1983

can you lose your house in a bankruptcy filing even if you are not late on your mortgage payments you can be foreclosed even if you make every payment on time it's rare but it does happen if you break any terms of the mortgage not just the payment terms the lender has the right to accellerate the loan and require you to pay the entire outstanding balance however judges do not like to grant foreclosures on people who are current on their loans so there has to be a good reason for the lender to do this traditional banks almost never foreclose unless payment is not made banks are in the money lending business not the real estate owning business however non traditional lenders individuals investment companies etc may find owning a property tempting especially if the property is worth far more than the loan this is how it usually happens bill borrower tells lucy lender he wants to buy a house to live in and that he has a large downpayment lucy lends bill the money needed to buy the house at a lower interest rate than she would have if bill had told her he was a landlord and that he was going to rent the house out lower interest rates for people who will live in a house compared to people who intend to rent a home out are common bill never lives in the house he rents it immediately a term of the mortgage states bill must live in the house lucy finds out about it and forecloses she was damaged because she gave a lower interest rate than she would have if she had known the truth bill ripped lucy off even though bill is current on all his payments the judge would grant the foreclosure because bill ripped off lucy in the last real estate bubble this set of circumstances was fairly common  Deflation (economics) Insurance Bond Bank Government National Mortgage Association Debt Real estate bubble Predatory lending Islamic banking Real estate Finance Donald Trump Financial markets Student loan Allodial title Foreclosure Security (finance) Concurrent estate Annual percentage rate Federal National Mortgage Association Real estate broker Debt consolidation Money Microcredit Mortgage-backed security Leasehold estate Annuity Housing cooperative Leasing Monetary policy Taxation in the United States Economy of the United States Capital accumulation Personal finance Title insurance Interest rate Mobile home Great Depression Savings and loan association Microeconomics Islamic economics Estoppel 401(k) Wells Fargo Subsidy Federal Reserve Monopoly (game) Economy of Pakistan Gross domestic product Citigroup Credit card Harlem Intellectual property Short selling Economy of India United Kingdom corporation tax FairTax Credit score Privatization Renting Surplus value American individualist anarchism Payday loan Anarchism and capitalism Corporation Bank fraud Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Business cycle Tax Supply-side economics Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Hyperinflation Real estate developer Schabir Shaik Trial Ponzi scheme History of the United States (1918-1945) Money supply Derivative (finance) Savings and Loan crisis Bankruptcy Babylonian law U.S. public debt Personal property Municipal bond Keynesian economics Free trade

i want to buy a house in houston how can i find a good real estate agent i am a first time buyer i need a real estate agent how would i know if the agent is good there are so many on the internet does it matter if the agent belongs to well know companies like remax first off finding a realtor is kind of like finding a shrink you have to find one who you feel comfortable with and who is trustworthy for that reason you should talk to as many as possible instead of trusting the first one you meet one way to do this is to look for houses in your price range in good neighborhoods get in contact with the real estate agents who are selling those tell them what you like about the house in question and ask them if they will help you find other houses that have those same characteristics find out which agents are cooperative and which of those you like and keep working with them obviously the for sale by owner guys won't help you find other houses and obviously the larger companies like remax and red carpet are generally more trustworthy than nifty ned's real estate still you should find out about an agent's creds how long they have been working their specialty continuing education certifications awards etc and even google for complaints about them usually the good agents with large companies will be quite open about their credentials good luck  Pretty Good Privacy Internet fraud White flight Mortgage Microeconomics Real estate Mutual fund Insurance Auction Contract Mediation Life insurance Deflation (economics) Trusted computing Tax Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act SCO-Linux controversies Dividend Citigroup American Broadcasting Company Ford Motor Company Babylonian law Multiple Listing Service Housing cooperative American Psycho Concurrent estate GNU General Public License Stock Sears Holdings Corporation Supply and demand Plame affair Publishing Enron Corporation Mergers and acquisitions Real estate bubble Maryland General Assembly Election, 2006 Trademark Economics Islamic banking Mid-levels Capital accumulation Productive and unproductive labour Naming rights Retailer Google Avenue Q Monopoly (game) Surplus value Oakland Athletics Title insurance Station wagon Public-key cryptography Estate agent (United Kingdom) Price discrimination Donald Trump Intellectual property Harlem Sears Catalog Home Monetary policy Best Buy LiveJournal The Emancipation of Mimi Council house My Little Pony Advance fee fraud Gold as an investment Marketing Real property RuneScape economy Tesco Insider trading Karl Rove Crystal Lake, Illinois Erling Dekke N__ss UK Singles Chart Warranty Airline American Football League Property (ownership right) Option Eaton's Vehicle registration plate Ford Falcon Inventory Real estate economics Sport utility vehicle Short selling Restrictive covenant Microsoft Government National Mortgage Association W.

how is a double closing done i wish to buy a home but complete a double closing with me purchasing and another buyer paying the owner how is this done i also wish to refinance and take cash out how do i do this i already have a contract for and i need the refinance money most people who are looking to sell and buy aren't looking to refinance to cash out money usually the money they need will come to exist when they sell their house less their loan amount which is used in whole or part on their next home sometimes a seller can time it so that the sale of their first home closes on the same day as the closing of their new home but it really isn't necessary since you can allow yourself extra time between the two transactions to move when you don't have a contract on your house for sale and wish to buy another house you merely write an offer on the new house contingent upon the sale of your old house your existing contract on the old house give you as much bargaining power as anyone else but you still must include the same contingency because the sale has not closed  Real estate broker Microeconomics Mortgage Islamic banking Insurance Contract Stock Tax Mergers and acquisitions Illegal drug trade Short selling Futures contract Price discrimination Life insurance Credit derivative Unconscionability Option Warranty Supply and demand Security (finance) Monetary policy Margin (finance) Dividend FairTax Derivative (finance) Internet fraud Financial markets Capitalism Money Arbitrage Investment bank Conveyancing Oakland Athletics Day trading Money supply Hire purchase Babylonian law EFTPOS Call option Credit card Enron Corporation Auction Corporation SCO-Linux controversies Rational pricing Privatization Inventory B__rgerliches Gesetzbuch Sales Primerica Financial Services $ale of the Century Dot-com Predatory lending Bulk vending Put option Wal-Mart Closed-end fund Consideration Hyperinflation Amway Poker jargon Oil-for-Food Programme MMORPG Variable universal life insurance Leeds United F.C.

can anyone tell me where to get help for residential energy theft i have lived in a fourplex in a bdrm apt for the past three years i have paid well over for electricity after receiving an elec bill i had an electrician come out and check my lines only to find out that the lines have been spliced and i' m paying in part fot the whole fourplex my landlord told me good luck in proving it i'm gonna need tath and then some i live in long beach ca and have checked with the elec co and they say that they cna't help cause its from the meters to the house and that makes it a civil matter help this thing is driving me crazy i have lived in a bdrm apt in a fourplex for the past three years and have been paying astronomical elec bills since moving in after receiving an bill this after paying a month for the past months on a level pay plan i have had sce investigate and they say that the meter reads are correct so i had aqn electricain come in and check out my lines there are lines that feed into my meter but only three that reach my elec panel in my apt plus there is a breaker box attached to my meter that probably powers the garage in which lives a guy with an elec wheelchair the electricain says that there is another junction box and a splice somewhere in the house and that i am definately absorbing other tenents usage to some degree my landlord jsut laughed at me when i brought this to his attention and told me to prove it as he knows that will be no easy task in my getting back approximately that he owes me for stealing my power help this is driving me crazy it may cost some money but before you start alerting everyone in the world about what you discovered or what you were told you must have positive proof i am not an attorney or an expert on your situation but i think you can get the ball rolling by doing the following a videotape or take pictures of the box and the lines make sure the pictures are very clear and very detailed b date and sign those photgraphs a if you have to it might be to your benefit to get a licensed registered and insured electrician who does work in that municipality to come in and explain to you where the lines are going and which apartment is being charged for electricity used by the other apartment who did the splicing and who is committing the theft please do not telephone or e mail the folks at city hall each every day the wonderful ladies and gentlemen working at city hall get bombarded with requests b the best way to do this is to go to the municipal building and ask for a list of registered electricians which that municipality recognizes and who probably paid the municipality a fee for a license and or registration in order to be able to do work in that municipality c you must make a physical appearance you must actually go to the municipal building and ask to speak with someone in the building codes or licensing and inspection office this is what those offices are referred to in pennsylvania i don t have a clue what they would be called out there if that municipality does not do that particular aspect or they don t have a department as i mentioned ask the person on duty if he she can recommend about five electricians who do work on a regular basis in that municipality d write down those names e ask that person working at city hall if its okay with him her if you can mention his her name when you make the calls to the electricians if its okay it may help to get your foot in the door with that company or that person a when you get home begin calling the electricians on that list b don t forget to ask the person answering the phone what his her name is knowing a person s name even if its only a first name goes a long way to getting in touch with the powers that be when a person has a difficult sounding name spell it out phonetically if you possibly can avoid it do not leave your name or phone number with any message on a voice mail or answering machine use this only as a last resort c briefly explain your situation to the receptionist ask the receptionist who it would be you would be speaking with or if he she that person isn t in ask when would be a more convenient time for you to call back to speak with that person call at the appointed time and briefly explain the situation to that person ask if he she can come out and give you a professional opinion about the situation if he she isn t able ask if he she can recommend someone or a company who does that work you may have to call an electrical inspection or electrical certification service company or individual all day long all these ladies and gentlemen do is inspect electrical systems and certify them as being up to code a when that person comes out inspects the system and provides a professional opinion about the situation and its discovered there is theft going on due to splicing or whatever is being done to run up your electric bill ask if he she will write his her opinion on his her company's letterhead and b if you will prepare a statement on your computer if he she will go with you to a notary public and get that statement notarized a when these steps are accomplished here s what your next step is b telephone e mail and write letters to all of the following b your landlord tell him her you have proof positive about the theft of the electricity each and every month that theft is causing you to pay a lot of extra money on your electric bill at this time its not necessary to tell him her how you got that information and proof demand an immediate correction of the situation as far as an adjustment to your bill i simply don t have a clue how this should be handled other than alerting the electric company give the landlord a reasonable amount of time about fifteen to thirty days to correct the situation stress to your landlord how much of an extra financial burden this is causing you i know this is a very slow time consuming aggravating costly and frustrating process if your assumption proves to be fact it should work in your favor b if the landlord does not correct the situation by that last day of that time period write to the electric company you should write different letters to your landlord and the electric company using the same facts stress to the electric company how much of an extra financial burden this is causing you b if the landlord doesn t do the right thing by you and correct the situation the next step is to write to the electric company or you may wish to consult with a knowledgeable competent attorney familiar with public utility matters b the county city district attorney carbon copy cc the exact same letters you sent to your landlord and the electric company to this office b the california state attorney general s office carbon copy cc the exact same letters you sent to your landlord the electric company the district attorney s office to the california state attorney general s office b the california state public utility commission or whatever the state governing body is who controls utilities in the state b when you write letters to these entities or officials please get an exact name with the correct spelling and correct address for your correspondence to that person when you simply type or address a letter and or envelope to the office of the attorney general sacramento ca or another generic name or department your correspondence might just sit on the bottom of that pile until someone decides to open your correspondence and look a little bit deeper into your letter and its accusations c please don t shortcut or skip any steps i know this is going to take time thank you for asking your question you did a great job not only for your information but for every other person interested in reading a sensible answer my answer tyvm i wish you well vty ron b  Expert system Theory of conduct Identity theft Taxation in the United States

how can i sell my house my house has been for sale since june of are there any ways to sell it besides a realtor any websites or other places where i can advertise my house if you've been on the market for over a year something is wrong you probably are not using a realtor and that is probably your main problem my second guess is that you're priced way too high and your home is not show ready of the time you may need to fix some things a few of the major turn offs are clutter and odors such as smoking and pets if you are going to stand firm on your price make sure you do the repairs and clean your home thoroughly especially if you choose not to use an agent revisit your price as there's no reason why your home should be on the market for over a year by the way only of homes that are fsbo actually sell and the ones that do the homeowners actually tend to net less than if they used an agent i know the fee seems high but after you are done paying for your advertising time and lack of knowledge you end up paying the anyhow selling a home without an agent is like going to trial without a lawyer you might think my comments are typical coming from an agent but i am an agent who has tried to sell my home on my own as well before getting my license to save the fee and after months i just stopped trying and got my license it's very difficult  Mortgage Microeconomics Insurance Mutual fund Supply and demand Monetary policy Short selling Intellectual property FairTax Economics Mergers and acquisitions Capitalism Neopets Auction Nintendo Entertainment System Windows XP Commodore International Broadband Internet access Publicly funded medicine Filling station Government National Mortgage Association Advertising Principal-agent problem MMORPG Inflation Video game crash of 1983 Monopoly Atari 2600 Search engine optimization Law of value Real estate bubble The Apprentice 2 Enron Corporation Best Buy Hard disk Technical analysis Topps Illegal drug trade Lawyer Predatory lending Blockbuster Video Financial markets Gross domestic product Pharmaceutical company Inventory Plame affair Cable television Opera (web browser) Stock broker Primerica Financial Services Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Taxation in the United States Dairy Variable universal life insurance Food and Drug Administration Public good Day trading Videocassette recorder Productive and unproductive labour SCO-Linux controversies Internet fraud Bond CPU cache IBM PC compatible Sento Social Security debate (United States) Airline Bank Arguments for and against drug prohibition Microsoft Windows Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis NeXT National Kidney Foundation Singapore Network effect Externality Citigroup AMD Wal-Mart Radar Capital accumulation Economy of Russia The Price Is Right Contract MOS Technology Copyleft Gold as an investment Sears Holdings Corporation NFL on television Inkjet printer Heinkel He 112 Atari 8-bit family Privatization Theory of the firm Surplus value Television in the United States Mediation Bulk vending Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus White flight

how can i sue my mortgage broker for lying me my loan officer for the nd time has approved me for a loan and it failed the st time we moved in on her word we were closing on such and such date on the way to the closing i recieved an email the deal was no longer no reason why then she quit her job leaving us in debt with the seller this time she sent the gfe and the preapproved letter and told us to put down the earnest money we were suppose to meet with her x's this wk and she never showed either time nor did she call we are suppose to close this wed or we lose the earnest money and are homeless with a yr old what should we do please help most of the answers so far talk about filing claims and that might sound nice but it won't protect your purchase and your deposit which is what your question was i would talk to the broker owner of the mortgage company if you were approved for a loan another person in the office can take over and finish it if you weren't approved the broker can discuss your options with you even if you didn't have a real loan yet you can most likely get approved within a week talk to the seller explain what happened how you acted in good faith that you want to buy the house you are doing everything possible to make it happen as quickly as possible etc you should do this through your agent if you have one if the seller is flexible they might be willing to delay the closing for a few weeks so that you can get a new loan yes it is certainly possible to move in to the new house before closing it's called being a renter we also call it tenant in possession likewise it is also possible for the seller to stay in the house after selling it's called seller in possession these are not always the best choices but they do happen and there are standard real estate forms for these situations if the seller cannot will not accommodate you by extending the escrow so that you can get your new loan they still might not automatically get your deposit money in california for example i've never had a buyer lose their deposit money even though one or two have had to back out after removing all contingencies the trick is this in order for the seller to keep the deposit they need the buyer's agreement to release it the buyer not wanting to lose the money sues the seller cost and files a lis pendens which means that not only is the seller being sued they cannot sell the house either the seller wanting to sell the house and not tie it up in litigation for several months will cancel the purchase contract and give the buyer their money back in return for dismissing the lawsuit this is not really fair to the seller but it does work and any real estate attorney will do it this way talk to your current landlord about extending your stay for another days document what happened so that later when the dust has settled you can file a claim against the loan company if you get to that point ask a question here again and you'll get plenty of help there are so many honest mortgage people out there don't stand for this crap get referrals to a good real estate agent and a good mortgage broker and you'll do fine good luck  Contract Islamic banking Short selling Insurance SCO-Linux controversies Plame affair Stock Advance fee fraud Babylonian law Security (finance) Option Life insurance Internet fraud Oakland Athletics Mutual fund Leasing ITunes Music Store Annuity Unconscionability Concurrent estate Margin (finance) Money Futures contract Bond Conveyancing Housing cooperative Federal National Mortgage Association Estoppel Derivative (finance) Wells Fargo Capitalism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Donald Trump EastEnders Article One of the United States Constitution Public domain Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Economics Citigroup 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Schabir Shaik Trial Supply and demand Financial markets Inventory Intellectual property Theory of conduct Hyperinflation Oasis (band) Enron Corporation Warranty Timeline of the Enron scandal Monopoly (game) Karl Rove Trademark Katelyn Faber Taxation in the United States FairTax Los Angeles Clippers Hire purchase Real estate Patent Real estate bubble New Deal Primerica Financial Services Rental agreement Tennessee State Constitution Gold standard Craps Plame affair timeline Real estate economics Leasehold estate Allodial title Social rule Big Brother (USA TV series) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Poker jargon Knots Landing Government National Mortgage Association Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy World Championship Wrestling Wheel of Fortune Spice Girls Tax Avenue Q Wal-Mart TLC Animal Crossing

should people who mortgaged more than they should have and they knew it be bailed out vs bankrupcy i've always wondered how people who are just starting are miraculously able to afford a house well of course they went for the extremely risky loans that were being offered to them left and right no income verification interest only variable rate etc when interest rates were really low so is it now our fault and we're supposed to bail them out or else it will affect the economy nonsense they took and knew the risk and recent 's history warned them what could happen and they ignored it i mean am i the only one who opens a history book any more but then there will be a glut of overpriced houses on the market so it will be a temporary thing believe me people who really can afford it will buy up those houses at discount prices and reap the rewards as they should should people who live beyond their means expect sympathy from those of us who play by the rules sacrifice wait and save up for things what do you think before i weep for any banks let them sell the pricey properties that they own huge mega skyscrapers in the most expensive acreage in major cities there's no reason in today's electronic age for any bank to occupy a mega skyscraper in manhattan chicago l a miami or any other major city they could have a building out in dogpatch kansas and consumers could care less in fact they owe it to their customers to do just that save money by moving to depressed areas thereby helping that local economy and cutting their bottom line costs passing higher interest rates along to their depositors i agree completely no bail out for the customers or the lenders let them all sink for making bad decisions it's called personal corporate responsibility  Mortgage Bank Credit card Monetary policy Debt Capitalism Bond Deflation (economics) Citigroup Interest Microeconomics Inflation Predatory lending Student loan FairTax Privatization Life insurance Mutual fund Finance Central bank Supply and demand Annuity Islamic banking Federal Reserve Gross domestic product Microcredit Health insurance Asian financial crisis Economy of the United States Rational pricing Capital accumulation Taxation in the United States Economy of Russia Arbitrage Say's law Corporation Hyperinflation Price discrimination Wal-Mart Gold standard Savings and Loan crisis Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Toronto-Dominion Bank Supply-side economics Money Government debt Keynesian economics Corporate finance Sport utility vehicle Federal National Mortgage Association Temasek Holdings Money supply Financial markets History of the United States (1918-1945) Free trade Subsidy Tax Security (finance) Real estate bubble Great Depression Derivative (finance) Intellectual property Publicly funded medicine Housing cooperative Usury Mergers and acquisitions Interest rate Income trust Labor theory of value Anarchism and capitalism Modern portfolio theory Tariff New Deal Short selling Flat tax Capital asset pricing model Yield curve Donald Trump Education in the United States Wall Street Investment bank Eugene Fama Futures contract Wells Fargo Auto insurance Risk Arguments for and against drug prohibition Sears Holdings Corporation Mobile home Surplus value CPU design Criticisms of socialism Tesco Leasing

is this lease valid michigan lease was signed by two students manager accepted of deposit anticipating rd student to sign students cannot return to school and cannot afford apartment detail lease did not specify unit number of apartment only general address for all units only of required deposit was taken by manager is this lease valid probably not but you are going to spend more in legal fees to get your money back than the value of the money itself i would recommend finding a new roommate if you are one of the ones who is not coming back you might want to kiss your deposit goodbye it is unlikely the landlord will come after you for the lease particularly if you explain the errors on it and the rental market is hot in your area he won't want to be bothered going to court over it  Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Leasing Credit card Rent (musical) Rental agreement United States Postal Service Eviction Estoppel Avenue Q Leasehold estate Contract Graduate school Public domain NorthBridge Apartment Complex Chatham Square Vista Way Apartment Intellectual property Apartment building Kyoto Protocol Islamic banking Sin City Attorney at Law United Kingdom corporation tax Friends Barrister Toronto Computer Leasing Inquiry Bank Octopus card International Criminal Court Mary Astor Education in England The Commons Trademark Public housing Israeli Arab Money Insurance Franklin D.

how can my company buy rental property i want to diversify my business it is no way related to real estate at all i am looking at the possibility of buying a rental property or possibly a vacation rental property i e a condo at a ski resort or something along that line which mortgage companies specialize in this i assume they will want financial statements from the company or can i do a stated loan what size down payment would be typical i know i could contact a lawyer real estate agent bank and a mortgage person but i don't want their salespeople to start bugging me right now i get too many telemarketers calling me now as it is i want to get some background info so i can ask intelligent questions when i start talking to those people mentioned above fortunately for you i am not one of the people on yahoo that doesn't have a clue so i'll let you know that unless you have a very favorable relationship with a banking establishment you are going to have to get a commecial loan which depending on the strength of your balance sheet or collateral that you are willing to pledge on top of the property itself will require you to buy with anywhere between and ltv this is called non recourse lending since you cannot be personally held liable for the loan they can only come after business assets if you default unless you are offerring collateral you will also most likely not get a year amortization on the loan that most homeowners get your rate will be higher as well as your loan is considered high risk lending criteria have loosened some and there are many programs that banks will offer now that they didn't traditionally allow in the past primarily because their residential portfolios are not growing at the rates they used to so you may be able to find a better deal so i would send some kind of correspondance to a group of lenders explaining what your criteria would be for buying a property and letting them have the mortgage and let them get back to you if they have something which fits your parameters like you said you don't want to talk to several bankers they will chew your ear off for a week my recommendation is to buy the property personally if you want personal buyer terms and then gift title into the company that way you get protections of liability from the property not being in your name you may also want to consider not titling the property anywhere near your company if it is asset rich as anything that happened on that property would put your whole company at risk of being absorbed by a lawsuit on the property you may want to consider the use of trusts or llc's to hold the property with your company as the beneficiary or member manager respectively these are options best discussed with a financial planner and attorney in your state  Insurance Citigroup Security (finance) Real estate broker Debt Islamic banking Collateralized debt obligation Life insurance Microcredit Microeconomics Bond Federal National Mortgage Association Mutual fund Real estate Trust (Law) USA Leasing Finance Capital accumulation Deflation (economics) Annuity Monetary policy Central bank Corporate finance Predatory lending Derivative (finance) Economy of the United States Interest Government National Mortgage Association Primerica Financial Services Labor theory of value Income trust Credit card Wells Fargo Student loan Corporation Title insurance Financial services Economy of Russia Berkshire Hathaway Taxation in the United States Housing cooperative Personal finance Bretton Woods system Plame affair Mobile home Securitization Intellectual property Savings and loan association Tax Collateralized mortgage obligation Financial markets Futures contract Real estate bubble Lawyer Stock Mergers and acquisitions United Kingdom corporation tax Toronto-Dominion Bank Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Privatization Money supply Contract Interest rate Capitalism Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Asset Government debt Property (ownership right) Concurrent estate Credit derivative Temasek Holdings Hong Kong Monetary Authority Economic relations of Japan Usury Surveillance Gold standard History of the United States (1918-1945) Institutional fund management Liability Bank of China (Hong Kong) Property tax Schabir Shaik Trial Enron Corporation Michael Milken FairTax Babylonian law Asian financial crisis Unconscionability Cost of capital Surplus value Home insurance

renting a house do you think this is fair i saw my dream house i've got the money for the rent and deposit and i know i can afford it but the agent is taking character references for all the applicants and is going to choose who he 'likes' best to get the house is this fair ethical surely they should give the house to the first person to confirm they want it and hand over the deposit etc i understand them asking for bank references but i feel that kind of picking and choosing is unfair i am a student with jobs who has worked extremely hard to get myself into a better situation my empoyer doesn't give references and the other person who could give me a reference is on holiday they are going to give the house to one of the working couples who both have jobs because it 'looks' better i'm gutted do you think this is right or should it be first to the post there are certain things a landlord cannot base their renting decisions on they cannot base it on race religion age sex or sexual orientation etc of the persons renting that said the landlord has the ability to rent to those people who they think are the most responsible and reliable people out there most good landlords learn to make a thorough check of prospective tenants including personal an professional references as well as past landlords to find out if there is any history which might cause them to doubt your responsibility remember it may be a rental to you but the owner is signing over the well being of a very expensive asset that belongs to them so that you can live in and potentially party in smoke in do drugs in and otherwise destroy on him if he choses the next renter badly so yes he has the right to chose a renter based on their perception of your responsibility  Leasing Rental agreement Gentrification Housing cooperative Babylonian law Abortion debate Leasehold estate Goodness and value theory Estoppel Public housing Monopoly (game) Motion picture rating system Theory of conduct Parasite singles Social rule Ethics Avenue Q Sexual orientation Human sexual behavior Apartment Karl Rove Scientology beliefs and practices Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Microeconomics Employment law Randomness Rent control Economic inequality Capital accumulation Infantilism Unemployment Concurrent estate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Eviction Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks The nature of God in Western theology Annuity Anarchism and capitalism Transsexuality Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Pitaten David Hume Economic rent Alcoholics Anonymous Theodicy Free will Intermediate consumption Little Britain Philosophical skepticism Judiciary of Hong Kong FairTax Monetary policy Asset Capitalism Plame affair Aesthetic Realism Efficiency wages Prostate cancer Prostitution Inflation The Young Ones (TV series) Property tax Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Apartment building Public policy Real estate economics Joseph Chamberlain Flat tax First-sale doctrine Cancer Education in the People's Republic of China Unlawful combatant Ethical consumerism Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Transactional analysis Education in the United States Corporate governance Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Same-sex marriage Life insurance Polyamory Coercion Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Katelyn Faber Poker jargon Causality Mortgage Dissociative identity disorder Economics Harlem Friends Waste (law) Bank Dead Like Me Sant Thakar Singh Gender role Public domain

what can i do when my landlord refuses to fix things in my apartment before with holding any rent look into the specifics required by your states landlord tenant laws in my state simply not paying rent is cause for an eviction you have to go through the court to escrow your rent there's a specific legal process for this but the short version entails putting your rent into an account with the courts until the landlord either makes the repairs or doesn't in which case after a certain period your can ask for the money back if it's not handled in this manner your landlord can evict you even if he's in the wrong certain repairs insufficient heat dangerous conditions sewage problems no running water etc are required other things new carpet paint cooling are at the landlord's discretion check your rental agreement as well to see if it has any clauses on who maintains what also it's illegal for your landlord to retaliate against you if you choose legal action if he raises you rent or begins harassing you be sure to let the court know about that  Leasehold estate Rental agreement Eviction Leasing Estoppel Contract Public housing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Waste (law) Monopoly (game) Assignment (law) Rent control Mortgage Housing cooperative Public domain Supreme Court of the United States Babylonian law Anarcho-capitalism Anarchism and capitalism Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Judicial review Conspiracy Concurrent estate Microeconomics Abortion debate Manorialism Apartment Irish Land Act Taxation in the United States Equal Protection Clause Appeal ABC No Rio Capital accumulation Plame affair Scottish clan Poker jargon Insurance Trademark American individualist anarchism Public policy Separation of church and state CPU cache Magna Carta Harlem Renting International Criminal Court Intermediate consumption Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 9 Sewage treatment Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Immigration to the United States Stuyvesant Town GNU General Public License Attorney at Law First-sale doctrine Due process Charles I of England Dred Scott v.

buying property in europe hi i was just wondering if anyone has bought property in europe i am thinking of buying an apartment in eastern europe slovakia to rent out to ski couples families in winter and hikers outdoor people in the summer months by the way its only an idea its not like happening tomorrow i was just wondering if anyone has any advice on what to look out for and any tips on how to make things run smoothly also gosh i know this sounds lame but can anyone explain to me how the whole process happens when you buy abroad please if anyone can give some advice to help my plans come together a bit better i would be really grateful thanks x the process to buy in slovakia is relatively simple once you've found the right property and buyer seller agreed a price you place a deposit with the agent this secures the price and the formal process begins also at this stage you should be aware the agent withdraws his expenses but only if you decide not to proceed if the seller withdraws he's responsible for paying the agents costs and repaying your deposit assuming nothing changes from your original selection of home a pre contract to purchase is raised via the selling agent thereafter a survey views the property and sends his report direct to the solicitor appointed for the sale given all is satisfactory a final contract is prepared signed by all parties and sent to the kataster land registry and circa weeks later the property becomes yours in legal title and you are then the proud owner incidentally the contract is usually formally translated by a certified translator in advance of your sginature etc mortgage not so easy in solvakia and probably not the best way to raise finance to purchase there numerous specialist brokererages are available but if you want help and one of the lowest rates for most european locations i've personally found is a guy called alex boston offered the best rates through their affiliate can't remember name off hand he also has good knowledge of the process when i bought my place he also turned me on to the fact austrian's like renting there since it's very close to vienna good luck  Mortgage Microeconomics Supply and demand Conveyancing Leasing Capitalism Tax Economics Islamic banking Insurance Intellectual property Internet fraud Futures contract Stock Life insurance Option Annuity Bond Derivative (finance) Monetary policy Value added tax Estoppel Housing cooperative Gold standard Illegal drug trade Gross domestic product Babylonian law Surplus value Appeal Privatization Hire purchase Mutual fund Plame affair Diamond Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus FairTax Property (ownership right) Predatory lending Hyperinflation American individualist anarchism Slovakia Labor theory of value Unconscionability Lawyer Marriage Price discrimination Financial markets Investment bank Rational pricing Inflation Real estate bubble Capital accumulation Monopoly (game) Construction Commodity Call option Oakland Athletics Inventory Transformation problem Debt Great Depression Anarchism and capitalism Royal Assent Copyright Euro Arbitrage Divorce Title insurance Warren Buffett Money Austrian School Temasek Holdings Law of value Warranty Flat tax Wealth First-sale doctrine Taxation in the United States Deflation (economics) Wal-Mart The Apprentice 2 Social rule ITunes Music Store Scots law Trademark Rental agreement Allodial title Free market Paul Martin Polish September Campaign Technical analysis B__rgerliches Gesetzbuch Credit card

i have made a full price offer to buy foreclosure house but the seller's agent is not processing what to do it is a foreclosure house owned by a bank and i have made a full price offer but the seller agent tells me that the bank is negotiating another offer and has made a counter offer he said that if the current negotiation fails then he will send my offer as the bank is negotiating so this shows that it is not a full price offer if the bank receives my offer then obviously they will take my offer because it is a full price offer how can i let the bank know that i have an offer i am very angry at this agent he also said that it is the bank policy to process one offer this does not make sense to me tell the agent to submit your offer now or you'll find an agent who will  Real estate broker Mortgage Monetary policy Contract Great Depression Supply and demand Stock Economics Deflation (economics) Unconscionability Internet fraud Stock market Capitalism Auction Predatory lending Bank Price discrimination Financial markets Derivative (finance) Publishing Enron Corporation Economic relations of Japan Monopoly (game) Short selling Airline Commodity markets Read my lips: no new taxes Hyperinflation Option Conveyancing Sears Holdings Corporation Money supply Gold standard Camp David 2000 Summit Gold as an investment Technical analysis World Bank Group FairTax Temasek Holdings Foreclosure Microeconomics Primerica Financial Services Arbitrage Kyoto Protocol Proposals for a Palestinian state Privatization Peace process in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict Investment bank Economy of Nigeria United Kingdom corporation tax Plame affair Islamic banking Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Wal-Mart Mergers and acquisitions Warranty Mutual fund Enlargement of the European Union Liberty Dollar Cyprus dispute James K.

can i rent my house out even though it's not paid for i was wondering if it is legal to rent a house out when you are still paying the mortgage does it depend on your mortgage company or the agreement does it depend on where you live i live in texas if that matters if the house is yours you can rent it the mortgage company merely has a lien on the property it does not depend upon where you live keep in mind that i'm not commenting on the legality of rentals in your area you'll have to check with your local government to ensure that your area doesn't have any restrictions on rentals same goes for condos check with your association  Mortgage Housing cooperative Renting Leasing Allodial title Insurance Property tax Monopoly (game) Title insurance Security (finance) Public domain Taxation in the United States Intellectual property First-sale doctrine Construction Auto insurance Rental agreement FairTax Credit score Public housing Leasehold estate Federal National Mortgage Association British residential property market Property (ownership right) Mobile home Condominium Home insurance Conveyancing Islamic banking Apartment building Estoppel Stamp duty Donald Trump Mechanics lien Value added Real estate bubble Annuity Capitalism Netflix Squatting Copyright Tom DeLay Eviction Foreclosure Derivative (finance) Motion picture rating system Bankruptcy in the United States Legal system of Hong Kong Subsidy American individualist anarchism Easement Rental car Government National Mortgage Association Rent control Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Mortgage-backed security Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory Tax Reform Act of 1986 Citigroup DVD Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Karl Rove Poker jargon Savings and loan association Urban renewal Individualist anarchism Bond Corporation Blockbuster Video Lawyer Cyberport Money C plus plus Unreformed House of Commons Airport Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Separation of church and state Copyright infringement of software Separation of powers Child support Mutual fund Apartment Politics of the United States Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Intermediate consumption Online DVD rental Life insurance Harlem Credit card Assignment (law) Personal property Patent Thomas de Littleton Collyer brothers Economy of the United States Campbell, California Anarchism and capitalism British property bubble

quick short sale question we submitted an offer to the selling agent on a short sale property last week at full price my question is should the current owner sign the purchase contract accepting our offer prior to submitting it to their lender we have not yet received any word from the current owner regarding our offer and the selling agent said that she would be submitting it to the lender i thought that the current owner of the property would still need to acknowledge and accept our offer prior to it being submitted to the lender for final approval thanks in advance for everyones help no the seller has no say it's the lender that approves the contract that is the purpose of the short sale any offer to where what is being collected from the sale of the home that doesn't fully pay off all mortgages incurred by the seller is a short sale if by chance your offer was high enough then the seller can call the bank cancel the short sale which he is more than welcome to do and they will be happy to do so and then the seller is in control of accepting or rejecting the contract these shouldn't take anymore than a week or so to approve don't believe people on here that will say it takes weeks or a month walk away from those deals b c that means something is up that means that the bank is just waiting for more offers and as soon as it gets a higher one they'll decline yours however it appears that the lender has to approve this one if you offered full price then you will most likely get it approved  Mortgage Short selling Real estate broker Insurance Contract Title insurance Bond Supply and demand Predatory lending Islamic banking Microeconomics Government National Mortgage Association Monetary policy Temasek Holdings Financial markets Life insurance Unconscionability Bank Citigroup Monopoly (game) Economics Debt Conveyancing FairTax Internet fraud Oakland Athletics Futures contract Security (finance) Auction Divorce Foreclosure Leasing Derivative (finance) American individualist anarchism Annuity Rational pricing Tax Intellectual property Usury Option Spice Girls Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Commodity Mutual fund Donald Trump Finance SCO-Linux controversies Surplus value Warranty Screenplay Trademark Gold standard Student loan Illegal drug trade $ale of the Century Final Fantasy XI Tennessee State Constitution Inflation Estoppel Pharmaceutical company Billboard Hot 100 American Broadcasting Company Price discrimination Enron Corporation Interest Privatization MMORPG First-sale doctrine Kyoto Protocol Anarchism and capitalism Capitalism Salary cap Philosophy of business Corporation United Kingdom corporation tax Air New Zealand United Overseas Bank Irish Property Bubble Oil-for-Food Programme Great Depression Growth hormone treatment Live 8 Babylonian law Tesco Arbitrage 1994 baseball strike Cyprus dispute Deflation (economics) Short (finance) State Inventory Real estate bubble Hyperinflation Repurchase agreement Federal National Mortgage Association

am i getting a great deal i am getting an offer from a builder on a almost sq ft house for about i mean it has a lot of upgrade almost a hundred thousand worth but with the real estate market going down the drain should i go forth with the deal oh yeah one thing thats bugging me is the house backs up to a street and i wandering if anyone owns a home that backs up to a street and if thae street really bothers you for instance when you're trying to sleep thank you your question sends a mixed message getting an offer sounds as though you are the seller but if the house backing up to the street bugs you now it sounds as though you're looking to purchase given the other comments i'll answer your question as though you are the buyer in order to determine if you're getting a 'great deal' you'll have to first know what the recent solds are of like properties similar age size number of bathrooms and similar amenities while there are public sites now that provide solds they are misleading you also need to know what those sites are not sharing for instance was there a seller contribution sc an appraiser will deduct the amount of the sc from the sold price for actual value in determining a 'great deal ' there must be a minimum of three comparables and at least one of those comps must be in the same neighborhood rural properties have different guidelines and i'm making the assumption this house is in a suburb another 'need to know' fact is that houses that back up to a street or unrestricted property are considered exterior lots residential property on an exterior lot will not get as high a value as it would if that same house were on an interior lot that fact needs to be factored into anyone working up the comparables for you generally speaking best buys occur with builders during pre construction close outs or if buying just before the fiscal year end for that particular builder i bought new last year during the last month of their fiscal year end and received a reduction in price money saving tip also know that upgrades is the bulk of where a builder makes its profits if ever you buy a build to suit from a builder it would be wise to purchase only those upgrades that are a part of the infrastructure for example a pest control system built between the walls of the structure go for it but if you prefer hardwoods to carpet or a microwave above the range in lieu of the standard hood save your money and take care of those things after you close unless of course time is more important to you than money in which case have them do it and be done with it if you want to take this research endeavor to another level have the agent working up the comps check out how houses have been appreciating if this builder is on the front end in building for this neighborhood chances are you'll have built in equity because builders are famous for continually going up in their prices if you're buying when in close out make sure you take the reduction in price lastly don't ever let a sales counselor bully you into thinking you can't negotiate remind them that you and their employer are the principals sales counselors are merely a facilitator to the transaction it's your money spend it wisely  Tax Capitalism Supply and demand Real estate broker Mortgage Insurance Economics Economy of Russia Islamic banking Gross domestic product Illegal drug trade Stock Capital accumulation Estoppel Inflation Progressive tax Mutual fund Monetary policy Gold as an investment Wal-Mart Life insurance Short selling Publicly funded medicine Construction Day trading MMORPG Security (finance) Poker jargon Flat tax Annuity Surplus value McMansion Real estate economics Wood Wealth Warren Buffett Mergers and acquisitions Bretton Woods system Free trade Commodity Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Option Model (economics) Free market IBM PC compatible Labor theory of value Taxation in the United States Intellectual property PE ratio Political economy Hyperinflation Keynesian economics Dodge Charger Airline Law of value Urban sprawl Monopsony Economy of India Modem Berkshire Hathaway Prices of production Great Depression SCO-Linux controversies Temasek Holdings Ethical consumerism Housing cooperative Investment bank Trademark United Kingdom corporation tax Object-oriented programming Microsoft Straw-bale construction Public good Debt Deflation (economics) Economic inequality Dot-com Financial markets Mobile home Unconscionability Neopets CPU cache Surveillance Technical analysis Futures contract Credit card

is an llc the right choice for me i want to start investing in real estate initially i intend to buy small apartment buildings units seems safe to me while i'm learning one friend suggested i use an llc instead of a corporation after researching it seems right but i'd like to hear some well reasoned opinions for or against the llc yes it would be kept completely seperate from my own finances a llc gives you the protection of a corporation it can sue and be sued it also has pass thru taxation which means it is not taxed on the entitiy level and the member level just the memebrs are responsible for the taxes it is similar to an s corporation for real estate investing i'd go with a llc  Limited liability company Life insurance Mutual fund United Kingdom corporation tax Tax Housing cooperative Taxation in the United States Trust (Law) USA Microeconomics Income trust Capital accumulation Microcredit FairTax Donald Trump Ethernet Mergers and acquisitions Inheritance tax Bechtel Corporation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Insurance Investment bank Annuity First Amendment to the United States Constitution Dividend New York Central Railroad Public transport Reaganomics Gross domestic product Nuclear power phase-out Australian constitutional law Warren Buffett Flat tax Avenue Q Capitalism Inflation Spirit of Ontario I 401(k) Free trade Social Security debate (United States) Baltimore Convention Center Hotel Project Property tax 39th Canadian federal election Democracy Lawyer Miracleman Lionel Corporation Landmark Education Progressive tax Real estate Trust (Law) non-USA Mortgage Corporate personhood Dalton McGuinty Coalition Provisional Authority Social Security (United States) Sears Holdings Corporation Pollock v.

new mobile home on my own land installation issues i am considering purchasing a double wide mobile home in the next days i already have more than enough money in the bank due to the unfortunate passing away of my father by way of the life insurance settlement i am just trying to figure out now wether it would be better for me to buy land for the mobile home or place it inside a mobile home park i already have all the information about pricing except for one thing if i purchase land for my mobile home how much would it probably cost to have the utilities connected i mean there's water lines sewer lines power lines and everything that has to be connected and i don't know how much something like that would run and who to call to get to do it the people moving the mobile home from the factory to the site have told me that they pretty much only deliver the home and they do not hook up anything also dosen't the bottom of the mobile home have to have like a concrete slab or something on it help i will be living in lake county indiana if that helps your own land is better but it will cost for things depending on your area a septic system would be the most unless there's municipal water close by the lines would be less than i'm guessing there should be others with mobile homes in the area that can give you details on what it would cost for the various items check with your town because they might have some restrictions too we had a mobile home in a park but the prices kept escalating faster than we realized then they started to charge for the trash collection that used to be free then they wanted to collect for the water that used to be free then the lawn service that used to be free and on and on no you don't need a slab they can set the home on concrete blocks that you can buy at home depot or one of the box stores be sure it's concrete not cinder block  Surveillance CPU cache Octopus card Autonomous building Mutual fund Solar power MTR Monopoly (game) Public transport Microeconomics Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Sears Holdings Corporation Mortgage Internet fraud Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) GSM services Tesco Hard disk Irrigation Gross domestic product Virgin Mobile Annuity Solar cell Voice over IP UK telephone numbering plan EFTPOS Commodity markets Berkshire Hathaway Wal-Mart FairTax Filling station Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus North American Numbering Plan Windows XP TGV London Underground Thermal power station San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Philatelic investment Kitchen Mobile home $ale of the Century Modem Poker jargon Insurance New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad Money Transport in Hong Kong Price discrimination Seismic retrofit Midlothian, Virginia Health insurance Heinkel He 100 IBM PC compatible Dawson Creek, British Columbia Textile manufacturing ITunes Music Store Taxation in the United States Network Switching Subsystem Capitalism Euro USB flash drive Bank Naval mine Dorothea Puente Craps Stock Redundant array of independent disks Hybrid vehicle Washington Metro Anchor Laptop United States Postal Service Manitoba Hydro Economics Dam Wheel of Fortune Free trade Hyperinflation Publicly funded medicine Cremation Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Password Mac OS X Natural monopoly Glossary of American football Warren Buffett Jersey City, New Jersey Mars, Pennsylvania PHP Internet IPod Rapid transit Railway signalling Bay Area Rapid Transit

looking for info on buying a single wide any help me and my wife bought a old single wide trailer to move into and save money to buy a house the only thing is i cant get the roof to quit leeking so im thinking on trading it in on a new one any one now how much a should be looking at to get a base modle plan jane nothing fancy to get us threw untill shes done with school and when you trade it in do they remove the old one free an help would be great thanks from upstate ny years ago before my wife and i were homeowners we lived in different mobile homes before becoming homeowners i sold the second one and used the money to buy property and we built a house you are definitely thinking right and on the right track i also worked at a dealership and sold new and used trailers they are trailers unless you live in one then they are mobile homes i always asked people how long they planned to live there just like a real estate agent would if the answer is less than years stay away from a new one they depreciate just like cars there is even a nada book published quarterly with values on used ones by manufacturer just like cars on the other hand the market is always rising which means on an older one which has already done its major depreciation it will never be worthless unless it is trash your roof leak is serious and must be repaired quickly just like a house before structural damage is caused by water i would go up to the roof and clean off all the old sealant from the joints with a putty knife carefully take a grinder or file and round the corners on the putty knife so they don't catch and rip your roof most roofs on older homes are very thin aluminum and you can poke holes with power tools easily our nd mobile home was a bank repo i got by attending an auction open only to dealers and i paid it had a skylight i couldn't get to quit leaking after caulking it for the third time and it still leaked i went up on the roof with a putty knife and gently removed my own caulk and all the old junk under it don't walk on a trailer roof with anything but tennis shoes if you ruin them throw them away they are cheaper than a roof i filled two paper grocery bags with old dried out putty from previous owners attempts but i got down to almost bare metal then went to sears and bought their best aluminized mobile home roof sealant and applied it i spent the whole saturday on my roof but my problems were over you do realize that you only need to seal the seams not the whole roof right if you can't get it to quit leaking quickly hire a contractor who does mobile home repairs you can paint over water stains on the inside with b i n white laquer which is sold at most paint stores but don't do this until the leaks are stopped you need to see where they're at then go over the bin with flat white paint or whatever it takes to closely match what is already there maybe the manager of the trailer park you're at could recommend someone local and reputable don't be afraid to go to a new dealership and ask questions if they are reputable they will treat you as well as any other customer if they blow you off as a small customer i wouldn't even think about shopping there for a new one you will have already discovered their attitude as far as trading in on a new one and them removing the old one you're the customer anything goes just like selling a house or car if the dealer wants your business he's going to do whatever it takes to earn it the day i spent on my old roof paid well i replaced the ac put in a new bathtub the previous owners had stolen the existing one during the repo process and did a few other minor repairs like the screen door latch probably and my wife and i had about invested and sold it for after living there for two years that's a rebate from the landlord you will never get from an apartment since i worked at a dealership and got a bank repo and had access to parts and supplies at wholesale prices my situation is probably not typical but it is probably possible for you to make money instead of losing it or at least get back most of what you've spent  Sears Holdings Corporation Mobile home Poker jargon Tesco Asbestos Ocean's Twelve Wal-Mart Mutual fund Knife Monopoly (game) The Inside Insurance Sin City Inflation Mortgage Illegal drug trade Seismic retrofit Sento Warren Buffett Wayne Corporation Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Atari 8-bit family Tire Money Gold as an investment IPod Knots Landing Bong Home repair Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Economy of Russia Floppy disk Shaggy dog story Diamond Gross domestic product Citigroup Hard disk Capitalism Dairy American Motors Columbine High School massacre Confidence trick Carl G.

i think cemetarys are a waste of land that could be put to better use the land is for the living any cmments i agree completely its a waste to keep land which is often beautifully kept just for dead bodies this is especially problematic in the u s where bodies remain in the graves for an unlimited amount of time as opposed to some parts of europe where bodies remain in graves for a certain period of time and are then dug up so the spot can be used for a new body the land could be used for something to benefit people who can actually benefit people that are alive and the bodies could be cremated once the body is gone the person is gone it seems kind of archaic to keep the body around when the person is long gone  Burial Death Burial at sea Cemetery Funeral Cremation Embalming Japanese funeral Linear Pottery culture Cryonics Mausoleum of Maussollos Prehistoric Britain Animism Vampire Jewish bereavement Jason Voorhees Football (soccer) Heinrich M__ller Laws of cricket Vlad III Dracula Property (ownership right) Urnfield Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Archaeology Alexander Technique Pol Pot John the Baptist Jewish eschatology Aegean civilization Tax Wealth Fugu Hitler's death Leasehold estate Apprenticeship Spacecraft propulsion Poker jargon Technocratic movement Corded Ware culture Avalanche Vladimir Lenin Battle of Jenin 2002 Nankana Sahib Saint Waste management Romulus and Remus Eucharist Daylight saving time Patent European Union The Waste Land Kosovo War Subjunctive mood Life insurance Resurrection British national identity card Plan de S__nchez massacre Eutrophication Hohokam Paul Is Dead Card game Operation Market Garden Night of the Living Dead Deus Ex: Invisible War English verbs Anarcho-capitalism Stomach cancer Microeconomics Trust (Law) USA Hades Social contract Post-invasion Iraq, 2003___2005 Growth hormone treatment Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Tlingit Kurt Cobain Second Amendment to the United States Constitution International Space Station Terri Schiavo Nuclear fallout Nuclear power phase-out Mojave people Capital punishment Neolithic Betting (poker) Indigenous peoples Subud Kaminaljuyu Skinny Puppy Prehistory of Cyprus Love Canal Reincarnation Anorexia nervosa Nuclear power Khmer Rouge Tennessee State Constitution Urinary incontinence Mercantilism

buying first home lease to own is it a good idea my husband and i want to buy our first home we have been living abroad and will be returning to the us we have no rental history and my husbands credit rating is poor would lease to own be our best option as we desperately want to own a home and get his credit fixed or are they just another scam a lease option or lease purchase can work very well for you but you have to read the contract very careful and either have a real estate attorney or at lease a lic realtor look over it for you the good a lease purchase contract will help you to establish credit you just need to ask the seller to report to the credit bureaus how a lease purchase works most of the time you will have to have a certain amount down this downpayment will go to the seller part of the downpayment can go towards your purchase price you make monthly payments like a rent plus an additional amount towards your principal for example you pay amount are going to the seller as a kind of rent and will be applied towards the purchase price with a lease purchase in the current market you lock the purchase price so if the market bounces back and prices are going back up your purchase price will stay the same as it was when you entered the lease purchase agreement after year or years your credit should be established enough that you can apply for your own mortgage and pay the seller off the bad most sellers will not transfer ownership until you paid in full if you get in default with your payments the now still property owner can kick you out and you loose your downpayment and your house so my answer is if it is a scam or not depends on the seller and how careful you are in reading the small print on the lease purchase contract it can be a good way to own property for situations like yours one of our sons is buying a property on lease purchase and he is doing just fine with it in a few month he will be able to get his own mortgage he will get a good interesst rate and can lower his monthly payments  Mortgage Leasing Islamic banking Real estate bubble Real estate broker Derivative (finance) Housing cooperative Insurance Leasehold estate Babylonian law Futures contract Microeconomics Hire purchase Taxation in the United States Tax Mortgage-backed security Government National Mortgage Association Monopoly (game) Estoppel Bond Gross domestic product Short selling First-sale doctrine Gold standard Credit derivative FairTax Option Concurrent estate Money Student loan Rental agreement Intellectual property Security (finance) Capitalism Contract Life insurance Title insurance Surplus value Deflation (economics) Inflation Supply and demand Interest Property tax Unconscionability Internet fraud Auto insurance Credit card Mutual fund Arbitrage Labor theory of value Free trade Call option Monetary policy Anarchism and capitalism Stamp duty History of the United States (1918-1945) Economy of the United States Property (ownership right) Capital accumulation Price discrimination Predatory lending PE ratio Rational pricing Option style Oakland Athletics British residential property market Allodial title Commodity markets United Kingdom corporation tax Health insurance Economics Put option Minimum wage Bretton Woods system Warranty Collateralized mortgage obligation Intermediate consumption B__rgerliches Gesetzbuch American individualist anarchism Unemployment Hyperinflation Renting Airline Bulk vending Credit score Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Copyright Public housing Economy of Russia Municipal bond Land reform MMORPG Prostitution in Germany Income trust Economic rent Conveyancing Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)

can a ny lease purchase tenant be evicted before purchase for non payment obviously the purpose of a lease to purchase agreement is to sell so you would charge late fees first and what not but what happens if the tenant buyer is days or more delinquent can you evict or must it be a foreclosure if there is a lease with an option to purchase tim this is unrelated to my question i am the seller trying to find out if i would get taken advantage if i do a lease to own and the people stop paying i am not in any danger of foreclosure not even close but thanks be forewarned the general concensus among landlords is that most folks who say that they are only interested in lease purchase rentals are scammers who are only trying to find a way to make themselves more of a nuisance to get rid of but if you have a well written agreement then they are strictly a tenant until the actually close on the property and they forfiet any and all equity in the agreement if they violate any of the terms of the agreement yes i would charge late fees and i wouldn't wait days for the rent to begin eviction keep in mind an eviction takes a minimum of days and can take months how much money can you afford to lose and how much time do you want to give them to trash the place you evict a tenant and you foreclose on a mortgagee rent your place if you want to be a landlord and sell the place if you don't if your prospective tenant really wants the place they can always make the offer to buy it whenever they qualify for finiancing  Leasehold estate Leasing Housing cooperative Eviction Rental agreement Estoppel Islamic banking Security (finance) Predatory lending Concurrent estate Babylonian law Foreclosure Annuity Real estate broker Stock Monopoly (game) Conveyancing Allodial title First-sale doctrine Futures contract 401(k) Public housing Life insurance Taxation in the United States Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Derivative (finance) Renting Insurance MMORPG Squatting Oakland Athletics Intellectual property Land reform Internet fraud Government National Mortgage Association New Deal Mutual fund Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hire purchase Real estate bubble Great Depression Capitalism Microeconomics Student loan Fixtures Deflation (economics) Apartment building Unconscionability Real estate Debt Eminent domain Advance fee fraud SCO-Linux controversies Plame affair RuneScape cheats Arbitrage CPU cache PE ratio Operating surplus Economics Property (ownership right) Call option Unreformed House of Commons Option Timeline of the Enron scandal Real property American individualist anarchism Credit card Free trade Stock market Supply and demand CBS Publicly funded medicine Price discrimination Lehigh and New England Railroad British residential property market Confidence trick Put option Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Stamp duty Schabir Shaik Trial Art Modell Bond Barrister Municipal bond Airline Hedge fund Poker jargon Anarchism and capitalism

rental question my landlord comes over to water the lawn on a regular basis and i have to foot the water bill every month what can i do about it first be careful don't say anything to the landlord until you've read your lease if you have one and know your rights second study your lease know your rights and make careful and accurate calculations of how much the water for the lawn actually costs per month i'll bet that it's a trivial amount but i could be wrong so make the calculation third if you discover that the landlord is watering too much or that the landlord has to pay for the gardening and the water for the gardening then have a tactful discussion with the landlord most of the time you have more to lose than the landlord so always be tactful fourth if and only if you are right the landlord is wrong and the amount of money the cost for the water is significant then consider going the legal route but in of the cases the legal route is not the best for you good luck  Leasing Leasehold estate Estoppel Monopoly (game) FairTax Gambling United Kingdom corporation tax Eviction Poker jargon Craps Insurance First-sale doctrine Blackjack Public domain Betting (poker) SCO-Linux controversies Babylonian law Lawn Mortgage Accounting methods Islamic banking The Amazing Race Irish Land Act Capitalism Slot machine Economics Publicly funded medicine Derivative (finance) Ethics Waste (law) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Microeconomics Taxation in the United States Property law New York Knicks Abortion debate Boston and Lowell Railroad Sears Holdings Corporation Credit card Bond Contract Gold standard Medical malpractice Bernard Williams Theory of conduct Health insurance Annuity PE ratio Tax Serfdom Surveillance Life insurance Utilitarianism Labor theory of value Law of value Public transport Geolibertarianism COINTELPRO Inflation Parliament Act Han Dynasty 407 ETR Age of the Earth Auto insurance Renting John McDouall Stuart Unemployment Tennis Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Software patent debate Surplus value Press Your Luck Domestic partnerships in California Identity theft Sports betting Intermediate consumption Article One of the United States Constitution Prince Edward Island Economy of Russia U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Intellectual property Land reform Vivian Solon Lend-Lease Arguments for and against drug prohibition United States Postal Service Externality Transformation problem Ponzi scheme Adoption Fixtures Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) 1919 World Series Sam Walton Interest Economy of the United States Neoclassical economics National Kidney Foundation Singapore

my mom says that flipping is over is this true i have answered this so many times i am just going to copy and paste my answer member since december total points level points earned this week best answer frankie b s best answer chosen by asker for some reason people seem to think you cant flip in a slow or down market i completely disagree it is all about purchase price fix up cost and resale price it doesnt matter if the market is increasing or not the way you make money on a flip is not with the market increasing but with the value you add to it yes the days of buying a dirty home and slapping some paint and maybe a little cleaning with bleach and make k is gone if you want to be a true flipper you can still make great money see you buy a house that needs flooring kitchen baths roof heat etc then when you fix these items you are adding the value not the market when your finished you sell for a profit yes the sale time can take longer but it will sell if you are paying heafty carrying costs this will cut into your profits so becareful treat this like any other business and watch your numbers always be conservative on the resale price never let an agent tell an unrealistic resale value just to get the sale now always do your homework i will give you an example of my last deal in this down market where flipping is impossible lol purchase price remodel cost roughly carrying cost none i paid cash if you can great sale time months sale price profit k i do this several times a year who ever says it cant be done has no clue what they are doing its all about buying low low low never be afraid to insult the seller with your offer you may get some bad reactions and even piss off the realtor but in the end when one says ok to your offer you will have a good deal on your hands remember always stay in budget  Microeconomics Supply and demand Deflation (economics) Price discrimination FairTax Monetary policy Sears Holdings Corporation Economics Illegal drug trade Arbitrage Airline Poker jargon Wal-Mart Economy of Russia Mortgage Day trading MMORPG $ale of the Century Real estate broker Tax Surplus value Insurance Privatization Mergers and acquisitions Islamic banking Bulk vending Ford Motor Company Capitalism Short selling Commodity Internet fraud Futures contract Citigroup Inflation Health insurance Bond Gross domestic product Technical analysis First-sale doctrine Textbook Keynesian economics Ra (board game) Tariff Auction Labor theory of value Social Security debate (United States) Warren Buffett Berkshire Hathaway Commodore International The Apprentice 2 Inventory ITunes Music Store Investment bank Contract Final Fantasy XI Gold standard Hyperinflation Enron Corporation Loss leader Best Buy Credit card Tesco Rational pricing Law of value Monopoly Capital accumulation Ashton-Tate Value added tax Video game crash of 1983 Public good Retailer Amway Wheel of Fortune Neopets Euro Intellectual property Air New Zealand Derivative (finance) AMD Bretton Woods system Electronic commerce Prices of production Dairy Betting (poker) Call option Babylonian law Externality Gambling Free trade United Kingdom corporation tax The Amazing Race Lionel Corporation

i wish i knew a realtor that wouldn't seem put out by me asking questions what's more important in your professional opinion for selling a home realtor incentives buyer cash back buyer closing costs paid or a percentage of cc paid sorry to keep asking questions on this same subject but i'm looking for suggestions and alternatives for selling my home my realtor is not much help she rushes me off the phone when i try to talk to her yes i'm calling her broker i'm not put out by your questions sounds like you're having a rough time with your realtor if you aren't dealing with any received offers then if i were you i would search around for a good by word of mouth realtor referral only possible problem would be if a buyer for your home was initiated by your current realtor then you would have to pay your old realtor a commission and not the new one if when you cancel your contract with your realtor be sure to read the cancellation carefully and check mark only the appropriate boxes removing him her from receiving any compensation from any sale if he has a list of potential buyers' names then he would write these names on the cancellation for your acknowledgement to choose from among the numbers you posted i would say number buyer closing costs unless the cash back is more than closing but in this market which is very soft buyers are having a field day they have so much inventory to choose from they can pretty much dictate the terms to desperate sellers remember it is the buyers who determine a home's value not the sellers if buyers aren't interested the main motivator to get their attention is a price reduction if a house is priced right then not only will the house get more showings but offers will come in a good realtor will provide you with comps for your home and be willing and able to answer all your real estate concerns i tell my seller clients who don't have to sell their home and are unwilling to reduce their price that it would be better to take the home off the market and try again next year rather than let it sit at an unappealing price i hope this helps and you can ask me questions anytime  Microeconomics Insurance Mutual fund Economics Stock Futures contract Short selling Internet fraud Option Life insurance Illegal drug trade Surplus value Mergers and acquisitions Capitalism Tax Inventory Contract Stock market Wal-Mart Mortgage Islamic banking ITunes Music Store Advertising FairTax Margin (finance) Privatization Security (finance) Annuity Intellectual property Monopoly Inflation MMORPG Auction Real estate bubble Corporate finance Gold standard Economy of Russia Price discrimination Commodity $ale of the Century Gross domestic product Discounts and allowances The Wealth of Nations Hire purchase Monopoly (game) Bond Mediation Call option Taxation in the United States Spam (electronic) Arguments for and against drug prohibition Ford Motor Company Euro Oakland Athletics Oil-for-Food Programme Day trading Google Financial markets Subscription business model American Broadcasting Company Enron Corporation Price gouging Nuclear power Real estate economics Labor theory of value Betting (poker) Arbitrage Babylonian law Live 8 Put option Deflation (economics) Predatory lending B__rgerliches Gesetzbuch Atari ST Warren Buffett Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Investment bank Berkshire Hathaway Dot-com Economic relations of Japan Corporate governance Principal-agent problem Keynesian economics Theory of conduct Atari 8-bit family Surveillance Conveyancing Trademark Title insurance Fair market value Hyperinflation United Kingdom corporation tax

what can i do to buy this house my parents are trying to buy another house my dad has a good paying stable job but doesn't get approved because his credit is not great my mom doesn't get approved even though she has really good credit because she doesn't work what can we do to make the purchasing of this house possible any suggestions please thankyou unfortunately when applying for a mortgage the person with the higher salary is the one who's credit score counts as far as the loan approval is concerned with many banks your mother wouldn't even be able to be on the loan because she doesn't work your best bet is for your father to find someone willing to cosign the loan with him or they just need to take some time improve his credit and then look into buying a new home please don't listen to the people talking about your mother applying and stating an income while they don't check of the time to verify that there is employment that would be committing loan fraud there is an audit process in place and there's always that chance that the underwriters or the fraud investigation team will choose your parent's loan to scrutinize loan fraud is a serious offense that generally winds up in jail time  Mortgage Credit card Money supply Citigroup Internet fraud Life insurance Debt Insurance Credit score Deflation (economics) Identity theft FairTax Bank Savings and loan association Predatory lending Bond 401(k) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Security (finance) Unemployment benefit Grandview, U.S.A.

maintenance fees for a coop condo townhouse maintane fees are extra monthly fees on top of the mortgage what are these fees can you estimate the monthly extra these fees will be on real estate website when you do the mortgage calculator why dont they include these fees on it cause maybe i can afford the mortgage but i hear that maintance fees and stuff may add like thanks usually while shopping for a condo etc there will be condo or maintenance fees discussed this of course will be in addition to the piti principle interest taxes and insurance you will be paying monthly sometimes the quote the monthly rate sometimes it is given to you in yearly form and you have to divide by this is a number decided by the condo association as to the amount of monies needed by each member owner to pay for all the amenities and or maintenance which goes on yearly i would want to know what the condo fees cover mine cover my water sewage trash building and parking lot maintenance and landscape fees it also covers the property insurance for everything up to the inside of the actual condo where my condo insurance picks up a good realtor should be able to tell you what the condo fees are going to be if they have increased recently and are there plans to change what they cover or will those monthly costs be going up or down in the near future when i moved into the condo in june my fees were month on january st they dropped to month in my world paying less a month is like a raise i would also want to know about the reserves the condo association has for emergencies contingencies and future improvements also if the condo association is planning a large project the condo fees you have been told may be due to increase talk to your realtor or real estate agent they should be able to clear this up during pre qualification these fees should have been entered into the equation sometimes a person can qualify for everything until they add the condo fees which adjusts the income ratio standings and makes them no longer look 'good on paper' in the process of closing the seller will have to give you copies of the most updated condo docs that are available at this time you may have to pay a 'copying fee' or something to that nature some of these docs can be hundreds of pages long other i've seen pages you will have a specified amount of time to look over these docs and see if you can 'abide' by the rules and regs laid out by the condo association if for any reason you cannot accept the condo docs and all the rules and regs that apply to the property you may and i say may depending on the real estate laws of your area state be able to end the sales buyers contract please discuss all of this with your realtor or real estate agent they should get paid to keep you informed and keep informing you about the process at all steps along the way if they are not doing this for you demand that they do their job or find another realtor or real estate agent that will realtors do this for a living and understand the closing process most folks will get into a real estate transaction only a few times in their lives a realtor can have hundreds if not thousands of transactions in their careers sometimes realtors can forget that a buyer or seller may not be informed as they are and make the assumption that the buyer or seller are better informed than they really are a good realtor or real estate agent will keep you informed and be there to answer any and all questions the more you know the less buyer's remorse if any you will have best of luck and do not be afraid to ask questions this is one of the largest purchases you will make in this life you need to be well informed to make the right choices  Taxation in the United States Supply and demand Life

tampa real estate i was thinking about buying a townhouse in the tampa area ideally i would like to purchase a single family home in a nice safe area but i can't realistically afford that as a single person living alone so i thought i might buy a townhouse as the payments would be the same as rent if not cheaper then finish grad school get a better job then rent out the townhouse later on it has to be better than paying rent right anyone have any advice or precautions regarding this plan actually you need to think about a couple of things first you need to buy in a community that will allow you to rent later on that may cause problems because a lot of condo townhome developments only allow a certain percentage of the units to be rentals a high percentage of owner occupants keep property values up so now you're thinking well i will just rent in a community that allows everyone to rent could be a good idea but then may not be sometimes property owners neglect their property when they rent the market is pretty soft in florida so there is a chance that you'll buy in a development that has a high percentage of renters that may affect the appearance and maintenance of the community these are just a few of the things you should think about before committing to a purchase owning rental property can be veyr profitable and you will have the best experience if you weigh out everything good luck  Microeconomics Housing cooperative Renting Property tax Donald Trump Anarchism and capitalism Public housing Leasing Real estate bubble Capitalism Property (ownership right) Capital accumulation Rental agreement Monopoly (game) Supply and demand First-sale doctrine Concurrent estate Intermediate consumption Economic rent Gross domestic product Progressive tax Gentrification American individualist anarchism Estoppel Productive and unproductive labour Mobile home Money Surplus value Tax Publicly funded medicine Carlsbad, California Leasehold estate Taxation in the United States Economics Health insurance Real estate economics White flight Ownership Extreme Programming Babylonian law Warren Buffett Intellectual property Economy of the United States Boston and Lowell Railroad Operating surplus Externality Annuity Stock Public good British residential property market New Urbanism Celebration, Florida Economic inequality Value added Condominium Land reform Squatting Labor theory of value Life insurance Islamic banking Law of value Electronic commerce Pacific, Missouri Harlem Dividend Marriage Unemployment Geolibertarianism Movie studio Great Depression Montrose, Houston Economy of Russia Hire purchase Auto insurance Graduate school Solarquest Major League Soccer Oakland Athletics Suburb General aviation Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Rent control Eminent domain Individualist anarchism Land use forecasting MMORPG Internet fraud Arguments for and against drug prohibition Timeshare Personal property Satchel Paige San Fernando Valley Consumption of fixed capital Bailment

what is the best way to find a real estate agent we're first time home buyers and i don't know anyone in our area that's actually purchased a home so i have no way to get a recommendation should i just check realtor com until i run across someone that's particularly helpful is there particular well know real estate agents such as century or remax that generally has a good reputation what would you recommend for finding a decent one attend open houses in the area and just talk to as many as you can you'll come across one that you click with and that's a much better way of finding an agent than a cold call to the office or walking in and getting whoever meets you at the door first as to relying on national companies don't go on that alone they have good agents who work full time and really put an effort into it and they have part time agents who piddle with it as a hobby and really don't care if they sell something or not plus they have a high turnover rate all agencies do a real estate agent's job isn't to sell you a house a house will sell itself their job is to help you find a home so you need someone who is familiar with the area and more interested in you than just selling you the first thing you can afford that is currently on the market the perfect house for you may not even be on the market right now and a good agent will help you be patient and not push off something else on you so they can just close a sale and move onto the next person honestly i've been happier with the smaller local companies than the big national companies  Real estate broker Mutual fund Insurance Mortgage Microeconomics Sears Holdings Corporation Gross domestic product Unemployment Steve Jobs Economics Plame affair Real estate Supply and demand Publishing Security (finance) Oakland Athletics Warren Buffett Station wagon Trademark Theory of conduct Advertising Real estate bubble Internet fraud Wal-Mart Tesco Government National Mortgage Association Social rule Call centre Tax Housing cooperative Annuity Plame affair timeline Contract Price discrimination Monetary policy Agent handling Modelling agency Stock Citigroup White flight Ashton-Tate Secretar__a de Inteligencia Wayne Corporation Title insurance Islamic banking Debt Say's law Life insurance Toyota Prius Pitaten Primerica Financial Services Capitalism Surplus value Carl Barks FairTax Care Bears Motion picture rating system Privatization Money supply National Health Service Alcoholics Anonymous NASDAQ Karl Rove The Inside Friends Property tax Syphon Filter Survivor (novel) Babylonian law Autograph Arbitrage Airline Federal National Mortgage Association Insider trading MMORPG Betting (poker) Open access Humphrey Bogart Inflation Principal-agent problem Mobile home Keynesian economics Financial markets Donald Rumsfeld MapleStory Capital accumulation Bretton Woods system Property (ownership right) English grammar Real property Monopoly Economy of Nigeria Intellectual property Avenue Q Option Sugar Land, Texas Mach kernel IBM PC compatible

when buying a home what happens when a home survey shows that a neighbor crosses your property line part of a neighbor's home crosses the property line of the home we want to buy what should we do pre or post contract the title company should help you you would require that the current owner get some sort of agreement from the neighbor acknowledging this and agreeing that it is not their property if it is a small thing like a fence or flower bed is two or three inches off the line then it is very common and probably not a big deal if the house itself or an in ground pool is constructed partially on your future property then it is much more rare and serious usually what happens in that case is a legal agreement has to be made on several levels between the two owners with the local government and with the mortgage companies of both houses that would be very complicated and you would want an attorney representing you to help you sort this out or back out of the transaction before closing  Mortgage Leasing Insurance Easement Life insurance Construction Property tax Islamic banking Estoppel Poker jargon Patent Lawyer Contract Oakland Athletics Conveyancing Real estate broker Capitalism Title insurance Unconscionability SCO-Linux controversies Trade union Allodial title Copyright infringement of software Property law Property (ownership right) Boston and Lowell Railroad Scots law Divorce Attorney at Law Microeconomics Futures contract Plame affair Donald Trump Copyright Israeli West Bank barrier Spyware Eminent domain Foreclosure Financial markets Constitution of Ireland Betting (poker) Trust (Law) USA Offer and acceptance Ownership Common-law marriage Temasek Holdings Supply and demand First-sale doctrine FairTax Political subdivisions of New York State Anarcho-capitalism Concurrent estate Octopus card Security (finance) Ernest Harmon Air Force Base Rental agreement Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Attorney General Deed Mobile home Same-sex marriage in Canada Public good Housing cooperative Anarchism and society Mergers and acquisitions Government National Mortgage Association Anarchism and capitalism Debt Non-aggression principle Trademark UN Security Council Resolution 242 Squatting Surveillance American individualist anarchism Notary public Tax United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company Los Angeles Clippers Long Path Marriage Land reform Bretton Woods system Vacuum Toronto Subway and RT UK Singles Chart Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Hire purchase Database Softball New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad Universal Studios Software license Short selling Law Cable television Digital rights management Gauge theory

help signed a lease and found mold before moving in what should we do first off my wife months pregnant and i found an awesome executive townhome and signed a two year lease before we agreed to sign a lease the landlord let us know that there was a leak on the second floor previously but it had been fixed yesterday we began the process of moving in i was getting ready to prep a room for painting when i noticed a line about inch thick and feet long going through the ceiling on the bottom floor it ended in a wall that had a baseball sized bubble i chipped away the paint to discover a pizza sized patch of mold and general grossness the line running across the ceiling has mold underneath the paint as well i can't get ahold of the landlord right now and am supposed to officially move in sign papers today there is no way i'm going to live here with mold and a pregnant wife i know the landlord will fix the problem but is there any way to legally get out of this we have everything packed we love the place is it worth it we haven't signed any paperwork yet but we did pay to hold the place are supposed to pay another today the landlord is very nice and accomodating and would surely refund the should we just back out right now please keep in mind that we are packed and ready to move if we don't take this place we would probably have to wait weeks to find a new place which is a pain we will have a newborn in the house in three weeks i would go ahead and move in but block off that room until the landlord can fix the mold it doesn't sound like a major problem and something that can be taken care of easily if the landlord won't fix it make sure you take pictures of the mold detailed pictures then get an estimate from or companies on what it would cost to remove the mold and fix the drywall and paint etc if he still won't pay i would go ahead and pay to have it repaired myself and then sue the landlord for the money you spent i have a feeling that the landlord will take care of the problem until it's repaired though block off the room and don't use it  Leasehold estate Casting Ocean's Twelve Poker jargon GunZ The Duel EastEnders Miss Saigon National Football League Knots Landing Estoppel 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Shaggy dog story Volleyball Guinea pig Pregnancy The Inside Rental agreement Friends Slot machine Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Drill bit The Sims 2 CPU cache Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Leasing Microeconomics Economy of the United States Windows XP Bristol Grammar School Wal-Mart Fecal incontinence Topps Bus models used in New York City Transit Plastic Menstrual cup Boom Town (Doctor Who) Janet Jackson Beetle in an Anthill Ben Johnson (athlete) Glossary of partner dance terms Theory of conduct The Contender (television series) Plame affair Abortion debate Japanese tea ceremony Public domain Humphrey Bogart Major League Baseball television contracts Haibane Renmei Jon Secada Bread Jumpstart 3rd Grade Francis Bacon (painter) Blenheim Palace Downing Street memo Publicly funded medicine Seismic retrofit USS Tunny (SS-282) Rent (musical) Mortgage Capitalism Asbestos Tire Futurama (TV series - season 5) Chatsworth House Nintendo Entertainment System Garth Brooks Kurt Cobain Childbirth Health insurance My Little Pony Bruce Johnson National Kidney Foundation Singapore Manorialism Xanadu House Hamster Dualism (philosophy of mind) System Shock 2 Surveillance Basement Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Traditional animation Sento Kitchen Annuity Charles Goodyear Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Buckingham Palace Gross domestic product

should i buy an expensive home or a cheaper home should we buy a cheaper home where it's going to take some work ex carpet roof paint ect ect or a newer home where we just basically have to move right in we don't really want to do repairs but if it will save us in the long run we are more than willing to do it also we have help the payments are about difference the cheaper home was built in the mid 's and the newer home was built in the mid 's it's just that if we bought the more expensive home we'd be on a really tight bugdet i just don't know what would be better on the long run fyi it's kinda the same layouts in both the homes and same sq ft the newer home is probably about more sq ft go with the more affordable one houses always seem incur more expenses than we expect so the more financial breathing room you have the better the only reason i'd reconsider the difference is if the newer house is much more insulated and energy efficient which could make up the difference with utility savings depending on where you live  Solar power Microeconomics Solar cell Autonomous building Mutual fund Hydrogen economy Roof and tunnel hacking Straw-bale construction Publicly funded medicine Sport utility vehicle Transformer Space Shuttle program Life insurance Gross domestic product Binoculars Timber framing Arbitrage Fuel injection Fuel cell C__ile Ferate Rom__ne Automobile Boeing 747 Laserdisc Mortgage CPU design Wind turbine Capitalism Brewery Psychiatric hospital Free trade Health insurance FairTax Rational pricing Digital photography Boston and Lowell Railroad TGV Xanadu House Personal rapid transit 401(k) Volleyball McMansion Rocket fuel Electric power transmission Apple Macintosh Hard disk Derivative (finance) BASIC programming language Biodiesel Green Revolution Price discrimination Stairway Nuclear power phase-out Euro Toll road Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus House Cruising (maritime) Taxicab Central processing unit Wayne Corporation Annuity Hybrid vehicle Electrical wiring Radio controlled airplane Stars!

why do realtors charge their fee based on a percent of the of the sales price what does the sales price of a home have to do with anything it does not cost any more to sell a house than a house why is not based on a flat fee sometime the realtors make more than the homeowner does this seem to be one of the largest scams played on the american public today it's not a scam realtors admit they get a fee they're required to by law like all commission sales people in a lot of cases the realtor's office gets of the final sale price and the realtor him herself gets but remember that the is what the realtor lives on they do not get a salary nor do they get a steady paycheck and they paid some money and attended a training program sometimes a couple depending on where in order to become an agent a realtor is even more elite they paid to play and they're working for however much they can get every self employed person lives by the motto haud opus haud victus no work no food of a house is but how many months did it take to get that money and remember realtors pay taxes after they get paid their earnings are not conveniently withheld so they can just blow their money up to of what they make goes straight to uncle sam for the sweat of their backs the less guarantee there is of a pay off the higher the risk of days without food and of getting the electricity turned off the larger the ultimate pay off should be imo that's the american way hope that explained  Real estate broker Tax Insurance Taxation in the United States FairTax Microeconomics Mutual fund Social Security (United States) Flat tax Education in the United States Credit card Capital accumulation Stock Short selling Progressive tax Wal-Mart Supply and demand Advance fee fraud Internet fraud Student loan Graduate school MMORPG Bond Primerica Financial Services Social Security debate (United States) Health insurance Food and Drug Administration Bulk vending Predatory lending Life insurance Anarchism and capitalism Privatization Economy of Russia Vanity press Education in the People's Republic of China Publicly funded medicine Inflation Variable universal life insurance Monetary policy Contract Economy of the United States Health care in the United States Filling station Annuity Enron Corporation Airline Cerritos, California United Kingdom corporation tax Economy of India Freeters Labor theory of value National Kidney Foundation Singapore Stock broker Member of the European Parliament Public good Bank Labor-power Tuition Law of value Surplus value Salary cap Islamic banking Minimum wage Auction Bank fraud Poker jargon Royal Assent Alcohol fuel 401(k) Estoppel Value added tax Mail fraud Home Box Office Hyperinflation Citigroup Corporation Cable television United States Postal Service Famine Property tax Micropayment Public transport Paintball Deflation (economics) Canadian and American economies compared Income tax Copyleft Public domain Tertiary education fees in Australia History of the United States (1918-1945)

what does refinancing your house mean i keep hearing people get this money back i don't understand what does refinancing your house mean this explains it pretty well it was taken from http www nextag com home mortgage what is a mortgage refinance html what is a mortgage refinance a mortgage refinance refers to applying for another mortgage to replace an existing mortgage on the property there are many reasons why borrowers decide to refinance their homes one main reason is to reduce interest costs with a lower mortgage interest rate other reasons to refinance may include reducing the risk from an adjustable rate by switching to a fixed rate loan liquidating equity into cash cash out refinance or increasing the loan term and reducing monthly payments a mortgage refinance has the same costs as a mortgage such as loan application fees loan origination fees and appraisal fees that must be taken into consideration though homeowners will have to pay these costs upfront in the long run a refinance with a lower interest rate is likely to save more money overall when refinancing for a lower interest rate the main deciding factor is if savings on interest will be greater than the total refinance costs and prepayment penalties some loans especially fixed rate mortgages have a prepayment penalty to discourage borrowers from terminating their mortgage early by paying off the remainder of the loan early homeowners will need to calculate the total cost of refinancing their home to decide if it is the best option many financial advisors suggest that homeowners look for at least a two percentage point reduction in their mortgage prior to refinancing homeowners can also use online mortgage calculators to get a better estimate of how much they can save by refinancing however online mortgage calculators usually do not take into account all the costs incurred with a mortgage refinance homeowners who plan on a cash out mortgage refinance to liquidate equity for home remodeling large expenses credit card debt elimination debt consolidation or any major expense might benefit from consulting a financial advisor with a cash out mortgage refinance homeowners are refinancing their existing mortgage with a higher borrowed amount this results in a single loan and loan payments that can be stretched over a long term homeowners are also advised to see if there are any stipulations or requirements set by their lender prior to refinancing their home for example the federal housing administration has several requirements for cash out mortgage refinances on their loans including loan limits the amount of equity that can be cashed out and qualification and eligibility requirements besides a cash out mortgage refinance there are also other options available to homeowners looking to free up equity homeowners can also take advantage of other mortgage products such as a home equity loan or home equity line of credit which generally have more flexible spending and repayment options  Personal finance Money Social Security debate (United States) Savings and loan association Mutual fund Microeconomics Islamic banking Federal National Mortgage Association Finance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social Security (United States) Gold standard Derivative (finance) Security (finance) Tertiary education fees in Australia Real estate bubble Bretton Woods system Tax Mergers and acquisitions Central bank Variable universal life insurance Futures contract Capital accumulation Yield curve Cost of capital Hyperinflation Euro Publicly funded medicine Gross domestic product Keynesian economics Supply-side economics Flat tax Unemployment Financial markets Education in the People's Republic of China Federal Reserve Interest rate Unemployment benefit Estoppel Free trade Subsidy U.S. public debt Economy of Pakistan Stock Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Collateralized debt obligation Property tax Food Stamp Program History of the United States (1918-1945) Financial services Capitalism Margin (finance) Betting (poker) Real estate developer Economy of India Economy of the United States Tennessee State Constitution Collateralized mortgage obligation Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Nuclear power Privatization Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Developing countries' debt Divorce Debt levels and flows Salary cap PE ratio Credit score Bank fraud Securitization Municipal bond

i have decided to sale my home i would like to list it on the internet what is the best website to use i have listed my home with a real estate agent they have not shown my house one time in the last months what is the best website to use for the listing my contract is good for more months with this agent i want to change companies if it is not shown before then who is the best agent to use i wan't someone who will advertise well and put the listing on the internet with pictures and a good description of the home if you have more months in your listing agreement try to use that time wisely sit down with your agent and express your concerns face to face let them know your expectations with advertising in print and online networking the listing with fellow agents and in the community virtual tour open houses whatever you want then ask them to give you a written plan for the remaining months that address all these concerns have your agent bring a copy of your mls sheet so you can make sure it's descriptive and has plenty of pictures and a virtual tour if you don't get satisfaction go to your agent's broker and ask to either be released from the contract due at no cost to you because your agent is not doing the job or get reassigned to a more motivated agent if none of this helps when the contract is over shop your listing to agents ask friends or family for referrals and have them prove to you what they are doing now to promote their properties copies of ads online printouts mls info on thier sales etc not what they say they will do for yours in the future ask for phone numbers of current or past customers so you can do a little background checking but the most important thing is to clearly communicate your expectations people don't read minds so don't assume your agent knows what you want tell him her good luck and best wishes  Real estate broker Insurance Advertising UK Singles Chart E-mail spam Major League Soccer Contract Internet fraud Legal research Plame affair Neopets America Online Monopoly (game) Spam (electronic) MSN Messenger Theory of conduct Electronic commerce Open access Information Services Procurement Library TiVo Trademark Multiple Listing Service MTR Domain Name System Social rule National Kidney Foundation Singapore Wal-Mart Sharon Tate Cyprus dispute Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Amazon.com Meat Loaf Whois Gmail Surveillance Censorship in Australia Outsourcing Mail Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Property (ownership right) MMORPG Management Management information system Nintendo Tesco CPU cache Intellectual property Monetary policy SCO-Linux controversies Cable television Google The Apprentice 2 The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Sears Holdings Corporation ITunes Music Store Little Britain Viral marketing Pharmaceutical company The Emancipation of Mimi Public-key cryptography Yu-Gi-Oh!

considering the current market trend is this the best time to sell buy or stay put in real estate i'm not sure what to do with my property real estate is a local animal some areas are doing poorly some not so bad and some are still hot i don't know where your property is but i would suggest doing a little old fashioned planning with pen to paper are houses in you area that are similar to yours in age size upgrades view etc selling for what price would you be willing and are you able to sell at a similar or lesser price will that sales price cover your current mortgage home equity line sales taxes moving costs and so on oddly enough it's a great time to be a buyer so if you are looking to get a super value in a new home that's very possible right now but you have to understand what you can sell your own home for first check with a local realtor for information on what your house may be worth on today's market and what you would net from that sale if it still makes sense go for it like i said it's a great time to be a buyer good luck and best wishes c  Mortgage Real estate broker Microeconomics Tax Mutual fund Monopoly (game) Supply and demand Advertising Capitalism Security (finance) FairTax Life insurance Real estate Technical analysis Gross domestic product Property tax Islamic banking Surplus value Insurance Price discrimination Option Capital accumulation Deflation (economics) Bond Real estate appraisal Intellectual property Diamond Day trading Atari 8-bit family Taxation in the United States Privatization Airline Free market Stock Predatory lending Federal National Mortgage Association Ming Pao Housing cooperative Mortgage-backed security Derivative (finance) White flight Law of value Futures contract Warren Buffett British residential property market Economics Pacific, Missouri Ford Motor Company Wal-Mart Commodity Productive and unproductive labour Personal finance Internet fraud Mobile home Marketing Monetary policy Concurrent estate Toyota Camry Newstead Abbey UK Singles Chart Berkshire Hathaway Illegal drug trade Fair market value Mergers and acquisitions Income trust Urban sprawl Insider trading Gold standard Sears Holdings Corporation Mercury Cougar Economy of India Computer and video games Stock market Prediction market Nintendo Economy of Russia Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis __lectricit__ de France Personal property Auction Annuity Investment bank Arbitrage Real estate developer British property bubble Social Security debate (United States) Monopsony Marketing research Inflation Free trade MMORPG The Market for Lemons Conveyancing Closed-end fund Black market Margin (finance) Exchange value

help rent just went up dollars with no notice can a new landlord just raise your rent with no notice furthermore can a landlord give you a day eviction notice with no previous warning raising the rent is not illegal in any state regardless of what some posters here say you have to be given a day notice though he had to inform you by july if the raise is in effect aug the day eviction is a warning and does not require any other warning it is not an eviction but a notice that he is going to file eviction if you don't pay your rent evictions take days i would strongly recommend you avoid that they stay on your credit report as a warning to future landlords that you do not pay your rent it is hard to find a new place with that on your record  Leasehold estate Rental agreement CPU cache Plame affair Taxation in the United States Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Squatting Accounting methods Motion picture rating system Estoppel Irish Land Act Identity theft Public housing Harlem Big Brother UK series 6 Irish Land League Appeal Microeconomics Money Big Brother (Australian TV series) Michael Davitt Assignment (law) Big Brother (USA TV series) Insurance Interplay Entertainment Highland Clearances Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ABC No Rio Windows XP Anarcho-capitalism Gentrification Computer virus Minimum wage Mensal__o scandal Surveillance Pinoy Big Brother Monopoly (game) Social Security (United States) Satchel Paige Mary Jane Kelly Leasing Freedom Party candidates, 2003 Ontario provincial election History of Ireland (1801-1922) Supply and demand Annuity Strategic lawsuit against public participation Judiciary of Hong Kong Ocean's Twelve Small claims court Operation Murambatsvina Housing cooperative Khalid al-Mihdhar New Deal Highland Land League Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Mortgage Sinn F__in New Hampshire Supreme Court Nawaf al-Hazmi Rent (musical) Renting Israeli settlement Capital accumulation Modding Freetown Christiania Great Depression 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Automatic number plate recognition Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 British national identity card Big Brother UK series 5 Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Poverty line Anarchism and capitalism Annexation Economy of Africa Road-rule enforcement camera Karl Rove Neville Chamberlain Campaign finance reform Mixed martial arts 2005 trial of Michael Jackson George W.

anyone else have their mortgage sold to www mortgagequestions com i'm just curious i originally opened my mortgage with usaa who in my opinion are a great company within the first two months they had sold my mortgage to a company who's website is www mortgagequestions com i always have trouble logging on to their site they say the password is incorrect sometimes they say the security questions are incorrect and after i have them mail me a new password it will say that one is incorrect i have to go through this everytime i want to access my account anyone else out there experience this too and i know i'm entering the correct info after about the forth time this happened i would write everything down to be sure i entered the correct info the next time i went to log on does anyone know if there is a way to have usaa take over my mortgage again this is just so frustrating their customer service is horrible actually phh mortgagequestions com run most of usaa's mortgage's on their behalf i used to work for them when they were called cendant so when you call into usaa even though they answer the phone usaa you are usually speaking with a representative from phh they call this branding they also do this with many other companies such as merrill coldwell banker era and charles schwab the list goes on and on phh is essentially the servicing agent of your mortgage usaa and all the other companies that partner with phh want to make this as seamless as possible so they give authority to phh to utilize their name to process mortgages on their behalf branding phh doesn't own usaa or any of the other companies but they run most of if not all of their mortgage divisions even though usaa is huge and has the capability to portfolio mortgages they usually farm out most of their mortgages to the company phh this isn't the case on all their mortgages but it is on most you can contact the initial representative who took your mortgage to verify but it is most likely the case here that being stated your mortgage really never moved from one place to another and will likely stay exactly where it is they are a really good company though so i wouldn't worry like i stated before though check this with your initial representative or with the post closing department as far as the website is concerned you'll definitely want to continue to contact them to get that issue resolved they are huge and do have it problems from time to time i hope this helps and good luck  Password Citigroup Debugging Mortgage Internet fraud Phishing Surveillance E-mail spam Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Plame affair 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Call centre Security (finance) Windows XP Domain Name System Independent Media Center Bond Sears Holdings Corporation Gmail GameFAQs Data retention Social rule Karl Rove Construction MMORPG Customer relationship management Credit card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Danger Hiptop Investment bank Information Technology Infrastructure Library Cross site scripting IBM PC compatible Neopets Tesco Real estate broker Stopping e-mail abuse Halting problem Ashton-Tate Mach kernel RuneScape cheats Mutual fund Skype CompuServe Roswell UFO incident System/36 Killian documents Outsourcing Financial services Collision detection Contract Lehman Brothers Jeff Gannon World Wide Web Timeline of the Enron scandal Delta Air Lines UK Singles Chart Identity theft Debt Steam (content delivery) Enron Corporation Insurance Intelligent design Pretty Good Privacy SCO-Linux controversies Charles Goodyear The Joker's Wild Theodicy Primerica Financial Services Electronic commerce Computer security Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act BlackBerry National Australia Bank Popular, Inc Database Master Control Program Software agent FairTax Opera (web browser) Simple Mail Transfer Protocol GSM services Lawyer CPU cache Goodness and value theory Privatization DeviantART Short selling Secure Shell Copyright Cendant

tax sale troubles i've asked a general question about tax sales before but just now i thought of another angle that i'd like to hear more about what are all the things that can go wrong legally etc when purchasing tax sales what do potential investors buyers need to be aware of on the lookout for etc so that they don't get more than they'd bargained for i think that my state nc is a tax deed state not a tax lien state so i think investors buy the properties outright i'm afraid of buying a property and thinking there are no other liens only to find out later that there was a lien i didn't know about also i was told that when you buy from a tax deed sale it nullifies the mortgage or something since tax debts trump mortgages the mortgage is basically wiped off the slate so to speak be aware of the total tax lien and any other liens on the property as you will be responsible for them should you purchase the home get an inspector to look at the place inside and out to ensure that it is not gonna be a money pit for you make sure you have the money or financing at the time of the sale good luck  Mortgage Security (finance) Microeconomics FairTax Insurance Donald Trump Municipal bond Contract Foreclosure Real estate broker Predatory lending Islamic banking Allodial title Concurrent estate Taxation in the United States Tax Conveyancing Mutual fund Title insurance Annuity Capitalism Mergers and acquisitions Warren Buffett Bond Corporation Economy of Russia Enron Corporation Derivative (finance) Federal National Mortgage Association Stamp duty Economics Life insurance Social rule Monopoly (game) Construction Surplus value Money Wal-Mart Unconscionability Great Depression Personal finance Gross domestic product Michael Milken Property tax Economy of the United States Capital accumulation Debt Deed Leasing Real estate developer Auction Temasek Holdings Government National Mortgage Association Real estate bubble Intellectual property U.S. public debt History of the United States (1918-1945) Gold as an investment Primerica Financial Services United Kingdom corporation tax Tom DeLay Law of value Bankruptcy in the United States Advertising Financial markets Free trade Deflation (economics) Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Supply and demand Gold standard Mechanics lien Dividend Treasury security Privatization Ford Motor Company Bulk vending Trust (Law) non-USA United States Department of the Treasury Charles Ponzi Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Oil-for-Food Programme Bank Insider trading Stock Government debt Supply-side economics Price discrimination Stock market Registered Retirement Savings Plan SCO-Linux controversies U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Jim Bakker Harken Energy Scandal Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Day trading Inflation

how much of a notice should we give our landlord when moving out my boyfriend and i along with his brother's and his brother's gf who don't live with us are in the proces of buying a house the closing deadline is my boyfriend told our landlord yesterday that we were in the process of buying a house and that we will be we'll be moving out while we may or may not be moving in right after closing i was curious as to whether we should have told him sooner rather than later our landlord never had us sign a new lease after the first one expired we've been here for close to years so legally he couldn't take us to court if he decided to be a pain in the but right since we had asked him about signing a new lease but he never brought a new one for us to sign basically i'm just curiious if we went about things the right way in our situation and if we could possibly have some trouble coming our way we live in massachusetts if that info is necessary i have checked the lease from when we first moved in and i cannot find any information about leaving notification or that the lease would continue if no other leases were signed the lease states that it expires correction i have found the paragraph stating that the lease would continue if no other lease was signed while i'm at it i have found a paragraph stating that the tenant is entitled to interest on the last month's rent from the first and last that being pursuant to applicable law i'm curious to know whether or not this contiion law is met it really depends on what was in your original contract even though you didn't re sign a lease you are still held liable it depends on the state as to what the landlord is entitled in some it's days some and some as many as common courtesy would be at least weeks so i think you're fine as you have given him at least days but you should be prepared for him to make you pay the full months rent even if you do move out on the th  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Eviction Babylonian law Rental agreement Royal Assent Waste (law) Plame affair Knots Landing Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 16 Public domain Boston and Lowell Railroad Appeal 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Real property Judiciary of Hong Kong Oakland Athletics Social rule Domain Name System Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Property (ownership right) Neighbours Enron Corporation One Tree Hill (TV series) Property law Notary public Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Civil rights Information Services Procurement Library Satchel Paige Housing cooperative Monopoly (game) Controlled Substances Act Mortgage United Kingdom corporation tax Irish Land Act Judicial functions of the House of Lords Unreformed House of Commons Rent (musical) Bush v.

holding deposits in california legal help please i gave as a holding deposit to my landlord on the th of july set to move in aug th as of yesterday i decided to not move in because of unforseen circumstances he called me today to let me know that he was keeping the and he might charge me for the additional day a day i looked up holding deposits in california and it states that landlords can keep some or all of the deposit if they incur additional costs to rent it the previous tenant paid through the end of july and so the apartment has only been vacant for days and being that the manager stated he had other tenants lined up the apartment wasn't going to be ready until the next week he was installing carpet and paint the charges he incurs really are not that high am i entitiled to some or all my deposit back and can he charge me for those days he doesn't have a tenant also and here's where i got stupid there's nothing in writing no receipt no lease everything was verbal also if i put a hold on the money order then get my money back will i get into trouble since technically since all we had was a verbal agreement and there is nothing in writing just my application the fact that you paid him money implies that there was an agreement in place so a written contract for deposit isn't necessary he is entitled to keep the this late in the game but he can't charge you another per day that is when he would need something in writing stating that you were aware that you would be charged that if you did not move in you see the difference let him keep the he's entitled to it it's very very hard to find a tenant after the st of the month and most likely he will lose rent for the entire month of august b c you backed out next time get everything in writing and don't worry about him collecting anymore he doesn't have a legal leg to stand on  Leasehold estate Leasing Rental agreement Estoppel Poker jargon Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Eviction Islamic banking Annuity Credit card Avenue Q Housing cooperative United Kingdom corporation tax Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Divorce Babylonian law Microeconomics Mortgage Insurance Betting (poker) Concurrent estate Taxation in the United States National Football League Friends Monopoly (game) 2003 California recall Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Knots Landing Apartment Social rule Barrister Mutual fund Salary cap Hercules Linton Plame affair SCO-Linux controversies Bond 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Property (ownership right) Rent control Euro Stuyvesant Town Manorialism Public domain Shaggy dog story Satchel Paige Surveillance Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Major League Baseball television contracts Surplus value Judiciary of Hong Kong 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Alex Ferguson New Deal Windows XP Kodocha Craps National Kidney Foundation Singapore Newcastle United F.C. 407 ETR Assignment (law) Politics of Hong Kong Short selling Gold standard James T.

sue for an illegal apartment i recently moved out of my apartment for several reasons i was technically forced out with constant harssing of the landlord either by him screaming at me and my wife for little things like leaving the hall way light on or running the ac when it wasnt over a certain degree outside my job is going to relocate me in the coming months and to be nice i told my landlord and said that i would keep him posted on the date thats when he started harassing us about stupid things mentioned above well apparently he had an imaginary conversation with me and that i told him i was moving out in july but how could i give him a date when my job hasnt even given me a date a day after we move out he calls me and says hes keeping part of my deposit cause he has to repaint the apartment for his new tenants isnt repainting normal for when new tenants move in and to make it worst i just found out that the apartment is illegal can i sue for past rent and my deposit or should i just eat this one and make his life miserable like he had done to me and my wife by reporting the illegal apartment and the numerous zoning violations to the township im not a spiteful person but he made living there the past few months hell and keeping my deposit just tips the iceberg i want to know what are my options here are more details i had no written lease just verbal agreement that i could move into the apartment the state is nj and again the apartment is illegal the apartment was illegal cause he doesnt pay property tax for that apartment theres an oven and stove in there theres a gas fire range built into the wall theres a full bathroom all of which the township doesnt know exsists and doesnt pay taxes on any of them he put all that stuff in after and made it into a self made apartment so should i take him to civil court for my deposit then turn his a in and why hes repainting the gas fire range on the wall is the cause of the stain to which he says is cigarette smoke but its not on any of the other walls i've never heard of an illegal apartment in what way what kind of lease did you have re painting an apartment is considered regular maintenance of an apartment and he cannot hold your deposit for that only unless you wrecked the walls or painted it a color yourself that was not in keeping with your lease each state has different laws concerning rentals i know in nc a landlord or lessor cannot legally with hold a security deposit unless it is for repairs or cleaning not considered part of usual wear and tear the lessor must also provide the lessee in this case you with a copy of the charges that were deducted from the deposit ie let's say your deposit was he must provide you with a statement within so many days of you vacating the apartment stating something like oven left dirty cleaning broken window and so on unless you can prove he was harrassing you that is a moot point i would research rental laws in your state look over your rental agreement and then decide if small claims court or an attorney is your next move if it's going to cost more in time and grief than what the deposit was i would just chalk it up to a lesson learned all imho of course  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Rental agreement Kitchen Apartment Contract 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Sin City Taxation in the United States United Kingdom corporation tax Karl Rove Estoppel SCO-Linux controversies Assignment (law) Renting Babylonian law Unlawful combatant Avenue Q Concurrent estate Public domain Barrister Housing cooperative Appeal Anti-Defamation League Stuyvesant Town EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Intermediate consumption Waste (law) Microeconomics Supreme Court of the United States The Inside Public housing Ten Commandments Columbine High School massacre Terri Schiavo Smoking ban Insurance United States territory Identity theft Oakland Athletics Patent Fred Phelps Karla Homolka Fair Game (Scientology) Social rule Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Asbestos Article One of the United States Constitution Guantanamo Bay Conspiracy Public-key cryptography Monopoly (game) Slander and libel Miss Saigon Economy of the United States Credit card Property law Mortgage Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Prostitution in Germany Rosa Parks Property (ownership right) Lawrence v.

income based apartments i was wondering about the whole income based apartment thing i've heard they look at your income and decide from there but then i see the profiles on the apartments and they have rent ranges listed that don't look any different from any other place exactly how does the whole thing work do these places actually determine your rent based on your income or what it depends on what you mean by income based some people have what is called a tax credit or section property where they have income guidelines but the rent is not on a sliding scale at these places they have to keep their rent below a certain level and you have to fall in between certain income ranges in order to qualify these are sort of an in between for people who can't afford conventional housing but have too much income to qualify for low income housing a low income housing property section or subsidized will have a sliding scale for their rent you will pay so much per month depending on what your annual income is the best option will be to call your local housing authority and ask them if they have a listing of subsidized housing in your community they would also be able to tell you about obtaining a section voucher which they would pay a portion or all of your rent and it would be transferable from property to property good luck  Public housing Taxation in the United States Property tax Section 8 (housing) Progressive tax Tax Monopoly (game) Economy of Russia Education in the United States Gross domestic product Real estate bubble Surplus value Leasing Public transport Capitalism Student loan Mortgage Poverty line Economic inequality Credit card Food Stamp Program Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Income tax Insurance FairTax Economic rent Public good Flat tax National Insurance Microeconomics Productive and unproductive labour 401(k) Housing cooperative Income statement Leasehold estate Money Rental agreement Estoppel Life insurance Gentrification United Kingdom corporation tax Government debt Education in Germany Government of Maryland Rent control Value added Harlem United States Postal Service Public domain Variable universal life insurance Capital accumulation Property (ownership right) CPU cache Bluetooth School choice Hybrid vehicle Annuity Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Copyright law of the United Kingdom Labour economics Trademark Squatting Entropy Public education Labor theory of value Anarchism and capitalism Jack Layton American individualist anarchism Apartment Supply and demand Arthur Laffer Copyright Tennessee State Constitution Public policy Extreme Programming Offshoring Anarchism and society Baseball Inflation Centrelink Motion picture rating system Slide rule Libertarian economic views Value product Unreformed House of Commons Explosive material Royal Assent Avenue Q Scientology beliefs and practices Freeters RuneScape Measures of national income and output Barrister Dividend Canadian Senate Contract with America Article One of the United States Constitution Oceanic trench

injunction bond a non certified judgement has been placed against my seller's property according to him there was no monetary awards in the case we have a buyer to buy the property but the title company is asking to take at closing for a month and then return it to him if it is unclaimed is this a good idea he is very concerned what would be the best course of action r this it sound like a lis pendens filing until the case is fully settled the other party has a permanent claim against the home if the case was fully settled and the other party did not receive any award or the award is paid in full then the filing needs released the title company believes there is no valid claim or the lawsuit was for a small amount but needs certainty i would close the loan the title insurance protects the lender buyers should always buy a policy anyway and the title policy will protect the buyer the will remain in escrow until a release has been obtained on the potential judgment i would consult the attorney preparing the deed if the case is closed it is a formality to release the claim the seller should not be concerned unless they need the money immediately in that case the seller is probably just out of luck because there probably will not be a way to get clear title otherwise  Real estate broker Title insurance Insurance Contract Mortgage SCO-Linux controversies Capitalism Lawsuit Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Islamic banking Option Short selling Microeconomics Gold standard Economics Bond Financial markets Life insurance Finance Stock Internet fraud Estoppel Warranty Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Slander and libel Trademark Privatization Hyperinflation Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Auto insurance Oil-for-Food Programme Babylonian law Price discrimination Government National Mortgage Association Surplus value Specific performance Security (finance) Predatory lending Call option Tax Credit derivative Money Annuity United Kingdom corporation tax Commodity markets Gold as an investment SCO v.

i just want to know everyone's opinion on buying a mobile home i already know the bad thing is the value drops low very fast any other good or bad things about them go ahead and tell me i might want to buy one during my life i lived in mobile homes twice the experience was not bad but i would not want to live in one forever regardless of size they are still limited in the amount of room available particularly storage area yes the value does drop fast like buying a car it loses a lot of value the minute you take it off the lot but if it enables you to be a home owner and lets you live in a better situation i think it is worth doing if your choice is an apartment or a mobile home i would choose the mobile home every time one thing that is both good and bad is that usually unless you own your own land you will have lots of neighbors nearby if that is good or bad depends on both you and them at times our neighbors were very nice and helpful but at other times we wished for a little more privacy sort of like family you may love them but you don't want them around to see if you might enjoy it maybe you could visit a friend or relative who lives in one for about a week that would help a little i hope you make the right decision for yourself good luck  Poker jargon Microeconomics Theory of conduct Avenue Q 2000 Australian Grand Prix GunBound One Tree Hill (TV series) The Contender (television series) Urban sprawl Goodness and value theory Maison Ikkoku Social rule Ra (board game) Health insurance Pitaten Infantilism Shen Gong Wu Hiberno-English Nicomachean Ethics Capitalism The Amazing Race Supply and demand Password Monopoly (game) Baseball CPU cache Gmail Gross domestic product Shit Draw poker Humphrey Bogart MapleStory Billboard Hot 100 Rocko's Modern Life Animal Crossing Friends Luck Bon Jovi Toyota Prius The Apprentice 2 Speed limit Arianne I, the Jury Fast bowling Betting (poker) The Suffering (game) America Online Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Quicksort Equine conformation Procrastination Automatic number plate recognition Windows Vista Phoebe Halliwell Mojave people Ocean's Twelve Predestination Cruising (maritime) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Steven Wright Blonde on Blonde RuneScape Boston and Lowell Railroad Redundant array of independent disks Electrophysiology The Fairly OddParents Make money fast The Joker's Wild Mobile home Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Love Hina main characters New York Jets The Catcher in the Rye Deflation (economics) Chess terminology Final Fantasy XI Wheel of Fortune The Ashlee Simpson Show Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Prisoner's dilemma New York Giants Property tax Customer relationship management Philatelic investment Cheating in Counter-Strike Karma Sharon Tate Incarnations of Immortality Guild Wars RuneScape skills Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Ethics Fable (video game) Great Teacher Onizuka Chess strategy and tactics About a Boy American individualist anarchism Big Brother (USA TV series) Alignment (role-playing games)

landlord question i have been living in a new apartment for about a month since its new there have been a lot of problems and things which had not been tested before we moved in we have a persistent problem with the fridge and when it does turn off we lose the contents of our fridge it is co managed by the landlord and the owner of the apartment what measures do i take now to complain calls are getting no where and they blame each other but get nothing done there are only so many times i can wait on the phone for a engineer to fix the fridge the washing machine the boiler can anyone help hi everyone i arranged for a fridge engineer twice what the landlord did do is send the reciept so the service was free however it isnt working and there arent too many days i can take off for waiting for an engineer and also the many calls if you have given adequate notice to the landlord and have given them adequate and reasonable time to fix the problem and they are not doing anything to help you then you could either pay to have the problem fixed yourself and send them a reciept and withhold that amount from your rent payment or threaten to take them to landlord tenant court they have a responsibility to fix your problems in a reasonable amount of time if you decide to withhold rent then they will either realize that you are very serious and go ahead and work with you or they might try and tell you things like they will evict you for non payment however they will have no legal standing if you defend yourself in court with accurate records and pictures so go ahead and start recording everything and take the lead in this issue and do what you have to do good luck  Leasehold estate Eviction Estoppel Microeconomics Rental agreement 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Leasing Anarchism and capitalism Bretton Woods system Taxation in the United States Insurance Royal Assent Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Judiciary of Hong Kong Social rule Scottish clan Appeal CPU cache Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Oh My Goddess!

can my mom sign her house over to me and my husband as a gift my mom wants to sign her house over to my husband i we are already living in the house and have been paying the mortgage payments the house is just in her name i have read about a quitclaim deed is that something that we can do or will we actually need to go through the process of buying the house to get it in our names i live in phila pa if that makes a difference quit claim won't work because you are not on title a grant deed is the most common type of deed used to transfer property from a seller to buyer grant deeds are used for properties that are mortgaged and not mortgaged the mortgage can stay in her name but you can hold title contrary to what people think and unlike an automobile upon closing of the property s purchase sale the title company records the grant deed at the county courthouse and sends the buyer the original in the mail she can transfer it to you and she will still have the mortgage burden which i hope you will pay until you feel like refinancing it into your name but the property will be yours  Mortgage Deed Real estate broker Allodial title Conveyancing Islamic banking Taxation in the United States Monopoly (game) Easement Microeconomics Internet fraud Security (finance) FairTax Tax Contract Insurance Primerica Financial Services Auction Estoppel Housing cooperative Stamp duty Refinancing Mortgage-backed security Copyright Babylonian law Real estate bubble Unconscionability Life insurance Derivative (finance) Real estate Intellectual property Possession Savings and loan association Dividend Foreclosure Rule in Shelley's Case Price discrimination Warranty Torrens title Personal property New Castle County, Delaware Trademark Option Municipal bond B__rgerliches Gesetzbuch Debt Futures contract Surplus value Leasing Government National Mortgage Association Public domain Supply and demand Financial markets Publishing First-sale doctrine Credit card fraud Federal National Mortgage Association Collateralized mortgage obligation Privatization Stock SCO-Linux controversies Schabir Shaik Trial Hire purchase Economics Scots law Debt consolidation Real estate developer Bond British residential property market Property tax Credit card Irish Property Bubble Doctrine of worthier title Capitalism Article One of the United States Constitution Consideration ITunes Music Store Land reform King Ranch Predatory lending Sales Fair market value Great Depression Education in the United States Beverly Hills, California Student loan Personal finance Home insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Trust (Law) USA Commodity Donald Trump Annuity Royal Assent Credit derivative CBS Wal-Mart

california's ellis act my neighbor lives in a unit complex her landlord filed an ellis act on her building but withdrew it before it went through so the restrictions still apply to her unit he's been making it almost impossible for her to live there she's a longshoreman and works nights he put a worker in the unit below her who's torn the same wall down rebuilt it four times and is blasting music from am pm so she had to move out my question is is she still able to move back in under the ellis act she didn't want to leave and has told the landlord numerous times in writing and in person about the noise problem but he refuses to listen i should add that he has tried numerous times to evict teh tenants in the building so he could sell it at a higher price since he bought it a year ago the ellis act relates to a landlord who decides to go out of business and take his rental units off the market the landlord files a request with the rent control board to remove or withdraw his building from rental use you said the landlord filed paperwork but withdrew the request before it was approved that means the building never changed status it is still as it was originally a unit rental property located in a rent control zone you mention restrictions that apply to her unit those specific rent control restrictions are governed by the rent control board in your city your friend can file a grievance citing all the problems she faced while a tenant unreasonable abusive noise is usually a valid grievance against the landlord she may be allowed to move back into the apartment with the same rent restrictions as before if the determination is that she was illegally forced to move she must show evidence that the landlord acted illegally your city or community might have a neighborhood housing authority or neighborhood housing office they can answer questions on tenant rights they are a good place for more information your neighborhood legal aid office can also help you on this and guide you in dealing with the rent control board if the building never changed status your friend wouldn't use the ellis act in her argument to move back into her apartment she would use the landlord's obligations to the rent control board and all other obligations he has when renting the units of the building if the landlord's request to withdraw the property was approved then later resinded your friend would then be able to use provisions of the ellis act in her argument you need to find out if this is what actually happened in court your friend might be allowed money or compensation if it's found that the landlord violated any of her rights as a tenant  Eviction Estoppel Public housing Housing cooperative Rental agreement Leasing Rent control Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Supreme Court of the United States Motion picture rating system Plame affair Public domain First-sale doctrine Appeal Taxation in the United States Contract Article One of the United States Constitution Stuyvesant Town SCO-Linux controversies American individualist anarchism Copyright infringement of software Anarcho-capitalism 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Harlem Judicial review United States Constitution Irish Land Act Unlawful combatant Anarchism and capitalism Parliament of the United Kingdom Renting Copyright Controlled Substances Act Microeconomics First Amendment to the United States Constitution Israeli settlement Babylonian law Apartment Labor theory of value Australian constitutional law Waste (law) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Immigration to the United States GNU General Public License Treaty Squatting Insurance Copyright law of the United Kingdom Arab-Israeli conflict United Kingdom corporation tax New Hampshire Supreme Court Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Tax protester Trade union Lawrence v.

are there companies that specialize in just building houses for private owners of property i own a vacant lot that can be built on and want to contract an entire house is this a good idea how much would an entire single family house cost to build first find out the zoning ordinances for the area in which your land is located if it is zoned residential then start doing your homework regarding the utility issues in your area the lot may or may not have utilities that can be tapped into for instance it may not have public water available in which case you may have to resort to well water if public sewer systems are not established in that area then septic tanks can be installed and maintained to take care of disposing used water and waste if natural gas lines aren't running through your property like many homes you can possibly rely on propane if you have never contracted the building of a property i would recommend that you hire a very reputable custom home builder in your area also consult with an architech to help you design the layout of your home and he will provide your builder with blueprints to follow in the building process be sure that the three of you communicate well with one another and are on the same page this is your home built with your money they are working for you and there is no such thing as a stupid question when it comes to such a large investment how much your home will cost depends will depend on many factors if you want extremely highend cabinetry flooring bathroom and kitchen counters and fixtures it will cost more fireplaces moldings the types of windows doors heigth of ceilings lighting fixtures as well as energy efficiant insulation all effect the price everything from the type of foundation to the type of roofing material have a broad range of prices ultimately all of these choices determine the price per square foot that you will be paying for the home if you want more space and can live with fewer frills your home will obviously cost less per square foot you can have a more simple yet large home built now and add upgraded creature comforts later on as your income and budget allows keep in mind however that the larger the home the larger the utility bills to heat and cool it's best to build a home that is usual and customery for the surrounding area for example you probably wouldn't want to build an square foot tuscan villa nextdoor to a mobile home park or sewage treatment facility you also need to be careful about building something extremely unique to the area such as a log cabin or dome style home if will be needing a mortgage loan rather than paying cash the reason being the appraiser will have a hard time finding comperable home sales in the area from which to help determine the value of your home the home is the collateral for the lender in the event you default on your loan it's value is just as important as your credit worthiness to the lender my philosophy is live beneath your means and don't become overly extravagent when building a new home unless you are independently wealthy the newest craze at the home and garden convention is always extremely expensive when it first hits the market and comes down in price in a couple of years make sure that your home is built in such a way that it can be upgraded as your budget allows or your family grows if you have or plan to have a family consider implementing what's known as a split master concept the kid's bedrooms on one side of the home and the parent's on the other young children typically go to bed earlier than their parents and this allows the parents to have private time visiting without waking the children conversely teenagers may stay up later during the summer break and parents tend to want to be in a quieter part of the home and may go to bed earlier the split master allows parents the luxery of not having to hear their teen's giggling music or tv hopefully i cannot stress enough the importance of checking out the credentials of your builder with the home builder's association in your area request numerous references and view homes that you can validate were actually built by this builder it's hard to believe that some people do not have the skills and abilities that they represent make sure he or she has the required license and that it is up to date it is also imperative that the builder is in compliance with obtaining building permits otherwise the building process can come to a complete halt until they are obtained while you are being charged interim interest each day regardless of progress or lack thereof that is being made on your home check in on the job at random times and make sure that your builder has his crew doing their job at all times once completed enjoy the gift of homeownership invite family and friends over often and make wonderful memories there  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Solar power Construction Tax Publicly funded medicine Nuclear power

does anyone know of a loan company that will make home loans based on income not totally credit history were paying off our bills and ones where our identity was stolen not fair i know we have plenty income just cant get financing we own our own property and want to put a doublewide on it or get one of the owner builder programs anyone know of any place we cant even get a credit card due to no credit anymore but our income is almost grand a month and we dont pay on credit cards or car payments please serious answers only and no smart remarks about paying our bills please cause we do most of the places did have the stuff removed from credit report and even after filing reports some places still refuse and we did work with a counseling place those places are one big joke they charge you to do what you can do on your own if your identity was stolen and these bills are not yours do not pay on them file a police report report it to the credit bureaus and report it to the lenders that you identity was stolen i am not sure i understand what would compel you to pay bills that were not yours and were made fraudulently what other bills do you have if you have no credit cards and no car payments there are very few companies anywhere that are going to lend only on income and not credit if they are not lending on credit then they are most likely going to require some collateral try beneficial and or household bank if those do not work you can look into filing for chapter or chapter bankruptcy if you are having a hard time paying these debts off you can also try a credit counseling service to consolidate everything and help you to create a payment plan to help you pay everything off sooner be cautious of working with a counseling program as many of these are scams if you have anything or a few items of some serious value you could also consider going to a pawn shop and selling your stuff to them you can make an agreement that you will buy the stuff back from them within a certain amount of time and they will simply hold your collateral lend you the money and you will pay it back with interest  Credit card Bond Bank Deflation (economics) Debt Student loan Donald Trump Money Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Bank fraud Credit score Gold standard Primerica Financial Services Monetary policy Internet fraud Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Islamic banking Security (finance) Government debt Schabir Shaik Trial Bankruptcy Finance Government National Mortgage Association Citigroup ACORN Economy of Russia Interest Confidence trick United Kingdom corporation tax Financial markets Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Derivative (finance) Credit repair Bankruptcy in the United States Taxation in the United States Corporation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Money supply Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Identity theft Credit history Leasing Mortgage-backed security Bretton Woods system Short selling Phishing Universal Studios Credit derivative Advance fee fraud Marshall Plan Babylonian law Cheque EFTPOS Fiat money American individualist anarchism Temasek Holdings Privatization SCO-Linux controversies Social Security (United States) Collateralized debt obligation Mail fraud Usury Dividend Islamic economics Free trade SCO v.

rent to own can one rent to own a house or how does that work is there any down falls into that will like to get some information rent to own is probably the most misunderstood type of transaction there is in fact it is very simple if you know what forms are required to be used in your state they are done when the buyer negotiates for it or the buyer can not come up with the regular bank requirements to get a loan and pay off the seller basically there are two types of rent to own rent with an option to purchase this is where you create an agreement stipulating that you will rent and you will be given the right to purchase the property this is done by creating a the agreement stipulating the rent to own transaction b the rental agreement stipulating the terms of the rental and the amount of monthly or other mode payment c an offer to purchase agreement stipulating the terms that the buyers and sellers agree to now when the buyer renter will exercise the option to purchase stipulated to in the agreement and in the future usually there is a monthly rent amount and another amount which is paid with the rent allowing the renter buyer to accumulate a downpayment as stipulated in the offer to purchase and to be exercised in the future rent with a right of first refusal this is where a rental agreement is created and a clause showing terms and conditions for a right of first refusal is added to the lease this allows the renter to be protected in that they make an agreement with the seller owner to promise that if an offer is made to them by someone else and they are willing to accept it they will promise you to bring you the offer and have you either match it or refuse and continue to rent there is usually a price set for this type of protection it is extremely important that the paper work be done right so an attorney and a real estate licensee specializing in that field should be contacted best of luck to you  Leasing Mortgage Contract Real estate broker Islamic banking Insurance Rental agreement Option Unconscionability Supply and demand Hire purchase Intellectual property Real estate bubble Annuity Conveyancing Housing cooperative Renting Estoppel First-sale doctrine Surplus value Life insurance Capitalism Internet fraud Capital accumulation Consideration Futures contract Babylonian law Warranty Leasehold estate Gold standard Standard form contract Stock Monopoly (game) Interest Anarchism and capitalism Credit card Price discrimination Title insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Taxation in the United States Tax Bretton Woods system Bank Oakland Athletics Economic rent Derivative (finance) Credit derivative Real estate Economics Stamp duty Auction Call option Copyright infringement of software Auto insurance Put option Commodity Copyright Land reform Monetary policy Security (finance) Mergers and acquisitions Copyright law of the United Kingdom Real estate economics Productive and unproductive labour Public housing Rational pricing Trust (Law) USA United Kingdom corporation tax Commodity markets Concurrent estate Financial markets Economy of Russia Plame affair Advance fee fraud Donald Trump Property (ownership right) Article One of the United States Constitution American individualist anarchism Arbitrage Inflation Eminent domain Hyperinflation Gross domestic product Assignment (law) Mutual fund CBS Property tax Trademark FairTax Octopus card Day trading MMORPG Spyware British residential property market

unlawful leasing practices by landlords and apartment managers one of my co workers used to work for a firm that investigated the practices of apartment managers and landlords he's told me stories of the extremes that landlords would go to to gouge extra money out of their tenants this ranged from charging residents more than the set late fee on rent to denying moving tenants their security deposit back has anyone here had a nightmare with a landlord i'm moving out of my apartment because of some issues that i have with my apartment manager the apartment building was once inhabited by college students and med school students it's in the medical district ever since going under new management most of these people have moved due to the manager's unsatifactory performance for one some people just moved into our apartment and they are drug users salers i know that it is unlawful to deny a person residency but what was the point of filling out a background check these people have all kinds of unsavory characters coming into the building and wandering the halls the manager is also in cohoots with a towing comapny that is contracted to the building there are some reserved parking spaces to the side of the apartment building that are unmarked guests of the residents and any other person who doesn't live in the building do not know that the spaces are reserved but the manager does not tell them until after the car has been towed for every car that is towed the manager gets money from the towers the manager also does not do a good job in recording payments made to rent and utilities there have been numerous times where she has failed to put into her system that i've paid on my rent and luckly i had the receipts to back it up just recently i have been charged twice for something that even she cannot explain and i know for a fact that i paid the money to her because i have all my money order receipts and the receipts that she has given me so my balance is zero she's also showing a reluctancy to give me my security deposit if it comes down to having to face her in court i will do it  Leasing Leasehold estate Credit card Babylonian law Apartment The Commons Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Chatham Square Vista Way Estoppel Housing cooperative Taxation in the United States Mortgage NorthBridge Apartment Complex Security (finance) Contract Eviction Suburbs of Johannesburg Anarchism and capitalism 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Tom DeLay Mensal__o scandal Judiciary of Hong Kong Insurance Internet fraud Apartment building Ponzi scheme Avenue Q Bank Labor theory of value Health insurance Microeconomics United Kingdom corporation tax Annuity Money supply Mutual fund Hercules Linton Renting Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Gold standard Friends Islamic banking Harlem Donald Trump Florida Institute of Technology Life insurance Knots Landing Social Security debate (United States) Tax Prostitution in Germany Walt Disney World College Program Automatic teller machine Public housing Monetary policy Rent (musical) Blackburn Rovers F.C.

how can i negotiate lower rent my lease is up next month and i've recently seen my same floorplan same view etc advertised for less than what i pay will i be able to negotiate lower rent on a new lease i know they often try to increase it at the end of the lease it can't hurt but dont be surprised if they dont give it to you i'd say go for it though if they haven't had any problems with you since you've been there no late pmts no noise complaints etc then they would probably prefer having you stay as opposed to hoping the next renter is as good as you so give it a try i always say hope for the best but expect the worse doesnt hurt to ask though  Atomic Kitten Leasehold estate Boston and Lowell Railroad Public housing Renting Gentrification Health insurance Capitalism Rental agreement Harlem Tariff Cyprus dispute Leasing Blockbuster Video Outsourcing Inflation Estoppel Theory of conduct Free trade Keynesian economics Intermediate consumption Broadband Internet access Prostitution in Germany Economy of Africa Canadian and American health care systems compared Winter War Microeconomics Paul Martin Boeing Palestinian National Authority Software engineering Satchel Paige New York City Economic inequality Economics Japan-United States relations Property (ownership right) Guantanamo Bay Progressive tax Neville Chamberlain Torquay United F.C.

what rights do i have vs my landlord managment would like to point out i'm a college student living in a college town so this might screw the management's view also not sure who is the one at fault the management or the actual owner of my apt so when i moved into my apartment last august the air conditioner didn't work it turned on but the compressor didn't kick in so it didn't cool i wrote a note and on the slip that you are suppose to write about whats wrong i came back a week later for classes and the a c was on but same problem i complained a few times but winter came around and for a different problem the maintenance man said he remembers the previous tenants also complaining about that a c and wrote that it needed replaced and that he'd mention it agian but that its no use to complain until spring complained in spring first once a month then twice finally in late june since my apartment didn't cool down below degrees ever i wrote a letter saying i'd purchase my own and withold rent after i purchase my a c i'd send them a copy of the bill and deduct it front my rent they came the very next day and the maintenance man noted it needed replaced so i paid my rent i called in again and they said weeks it'd be replaced weeks later i called and they said any day end of july hit so i called agian and they said today or tomorrow anyways the guy came to replace it and found out they got the wrong size so called in again the new one was suppose to come in yesterday or today in the mean time the a c in my bedroom ended up leaking on the inside and soaked the carpet under one bed and basically half the room i called them and they showed up late last night they pushed my one bed up against my bathroom so i have a inch gap to slide in and said the carpet cleaners would come any minute they didn't show called agian this morning same story so busted a c a carpet that is smelling like mildew and stinking up my entire apartment also i technically can't replace my own a c if i did i could get fined so they supplied an a c with the apt a reason why i got said apartment and i'm not allowed to replace it so i feel like this is their responsibility a lot of times you have to show proof that you notified them of a problem with the apartment such as a certified letter return receipt you may want to get sworn statement from the maintenance man if he's willing to give one apartment managers must notify the owners of anything that is needed for the apartment and get the owners okay first speaking from experience however it shouldn't have taken as long as you said it did one way to find out what is legal in your state is to google your state statutes then look for the section dealing with rental law you may have to navigate a bit but you can find it as for the water damage they are more than likely responsible for any damage to your belongings that resulted from the leak also if you have health issues resulting from the mold such as asthma they may be responsible for any medical bills  Plame affair Leasehold estate Avenue Q Heinkel He 112 Public domain 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Estoppel Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Heinkel He 100 Apartment Oasis (band) Rental agreement Babylonian law W.

how can i do a subject to deal without putting my name on the deed i'm a new investor and i found a property that i would like to invest in i would like to do a subject to deal for the deed but i want to assign it to another investor therfore i would not need to be on the deed because i will not be the one making the payments this is stated in the contract that payments will not begin until i find a buyer investor i have days to do so does the deed have to go in my name once i get the property under contract or can i just wait until i find an investor to assign it to and put it in their name please help this may be my first deal don't do a deed there are a bunch of idiotics roaming tv and the internet who say do a quit claim deed which is a horrible way to do it all you have to do is put a subject to line in your offer purchase contract which says subject to buyer's option to assign all or partial interest in the purchase to a third party this simply means you have the sole option of either continuing with the transaction on your own continuing the transaction but bringing in a third party as a partner or assigning the rights to the transaction to another investor if you find another investor you simply write up a very simple assignment your escrow company will have several which will essentially say for the amount of bob buyer assigns all rights to the purchase of iwanna house street in a transaction with sally seller to andy assignee although it would be a very good idea to run the paperwork past a good realestate attorney your first time out to make sure it works for your state's laws good luck  Contract Mortgage Islamic banking Real estate broker Security (finance) Microeconomics Stock Conveyancing Annuity Advance fee fraud Supply and demand Option Unconscionability Derivative (finance) B__rgerliches Gesetzbuch Mutual fund Intellectual property Dividend Arbitrage Internet fraud Warranty Futures contract Investment bank CBS Consideration Leasing Insurance Hire purchase Capitalism Assignment (law) Bank Tax Corporation Credit derivative Short selling Auction Title insurance Mergers and acquisitions Babylonian law Surplus value Technical analysis Call option Lawyer FairTax Municipal bond Corporate governance Concurrent estate Standard form contract Ponzi scheme Monopoly (game) Real estate Trademark Rational pricing Put option Stock market Estoppel Bond Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus First-sale doctrine Gross domestic product Warren Buffett Property (ownership right) Boston and Lowell Railroad Free trade SCO-Linux controversies Economy of Venezuela Anarchism and capitalism Software patent debate Allodial title Adverse possession Insider trading Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Price discrimination Free market Liberty Dollar Citigroup Los Angeles Clippers Divorce Collateralized debt obligation Venture capital Privatization Capital accumulation Arturo Frondizi Scots law Government National Mortgage Association Day trading Rule in Shelley's Case Financial markets Public domain Joseph Ellicott Ethical consumerism Screenplay Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution

trouble with the tenants upstairs i live in an apartment with my son and my husband when he's not in iraq in june the apartment upstairs was leased to three guys about a month after they moved in i had a hole open in my bedroom i put an order in with maintenance and they came in and patched up the hole a week later i come home to a steady stream of water in my room and in the bathroom i called the emergency maintenance and they came out to check out the damage they went to the apartment above mine and the guys didn't have a shower curtain up and they had an inch of standing water on their floor yet the tenants didn't see this as a problem the maintenance guys called the landlord and he came and let me out of my lease as i was moving my stuff out the guys from upstairs came to my door and started threateing me with a lawsuit because the landlord was having them evicted i didn't know what to say so i shut the door in their face what would you do in this situation i'm not too concerned about the lawsuit threat i'm an attorney we live in a small town and i'm afraid they may try something if we ever see one another again sorry i wasn't very clear on that before i'm living back home right now while my husband is in iraq i only have about more months here and i had trouble finding an apartment that would let me only lease for months and not a full year since i currently live in a college town most of the housing is taken by students i had to move back in with my parents which i hate doing since i've been on my own for a while now if i lived down where my hubby is stationed when he's home this wouldn't be a problem i think you did the right thing you know they have no basis for a lawsuit if they should bring it up again explain that the maintenance guys called the landlord and not you try to redirect their anger chances are they will find a new place to live and if you don't go near their location they will likely calm down however as a marine wife don't forget your other resources if you see a problem let some of the other marines know what is going on they'll get your back the marine's are a tight unit who protect their own  Friends Leasehold estate Kitchen Maison Ikkoku 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Avenue Q Trapped in the Closet Apartment Big Brother (USA TV series) Chatsworth House Rental agreement Blood Simple Sin City Poker jargon 2004 Republican National Convention Humphrey Bogart Public housing Shaggy dog story EastEnders M16 (rifle) Eviction The Shining (film) Piccolo Junior Saga Little Britain Vista Way One Tree Hill (TV series) Rent (musical) Miss Saigon Babe Ruth Fred Phelps Queensbridge Bristol Grammar School Waste (law) Plame affair timeline Black Books Babylonian law Richard Chase Windows XP Meat Loaf Enron Corporation Buckingham Palace Mark Guglielmo White House Columbine High School massacre Satchel Paige Donald Neilson University of Tennessee at Chattanooga Cosmo Kramer Jessica Lynch Passenger car Florida Institute of Technology Post-invasion Iraq, 2003___2005 NorthBridge Apartment Complex Reservoir Dogs George Costanza The Commons Hamster Marilyn Monroe World Trade Center StarCraft: Uprising Stuyvesant Town The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan The Star Wars Holiday Special Eddie Guerrero Chatham Square NWo Full Metal Panic?

security deposit what can ido as a landlord who did not let evicted tenants knowin writing within the days that they were not ging to get their security deposit back because of damage they caused to my home they are sueing me p s i'm years old and on social security rules regarding this depend on the state you live in unfortunately it sounds like you have a scum for a tenant some laws actually state that if you fail to provide in writing an itemized list of deductions from the security that you will forfeit your right to that security for any reason the laws are lousy and usually cater to the tenant who screws you for and leaves your apartment in shambles if i find out anything i will let you know the only thing i can think of right now is to sue him in small claims court if you want to go through that maybe you want someone to show up for you in court so you can avoid the hassle take a video or photos of the damaged apartment do you have a condition sheet stating how it was when the tenant moved in if so both of you should have signed it and that will help in court you could always draw up an itemized letter back date it and tell the court that is what was given to the tenant but the tenant claims he never got it sometimes there is no good in being truthful with these jerks as they are not truthful and usually get pity from the court eventhough they don't deserve it try to find some big landlords in your area and find out what they would do most have been through similar situations also check out tenant landlord rights within your state you can type that into a yahoo search good luck  Leasehold estate Contract Legal research Rental agreement Babylonian law Negligence Fair use Estoppel Leasing Mortgage Public housing Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Moore v.

wanting to move to north carolina what are some of the pros and cons if we do move i'll be transfering from my job in nevada to somewhere in nc housing looks affordable and the area looks beautiful but what's the weather like as far as hurricanes and tornadoes i can get used to the humidty but does it rain constantly and is it a good rain or a pain in the ass rain how's the crime rate schools and locals we don't want to move into a big city either we currently live in a town with about people in it and like the small town feel and we don't mind having to travel a couple miles to get to the big city any suggestions i grew up there and go back to see family but haven't lived there for a long time so my answer may be a bit dated still i loved it yes it is humid but not that humid its pretty hot in the summer and nice in the winter it can get cold but rarely snows maybe times per year you have the mountains on the west and beaches on the east kinda hilly in the middle hurricanes hit every so often but this only affects the beach areas and its easy to get out before the hurricane hits there are lots of smaller towns and a few big ones crime rate is ok to low schools are not great but also ok locals are very friendly overal i'd highly reccommend it but then again i did grow up there so i may be a bit biased best luck  Severe weather terminology (United States) Pensacola, Florida 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Florida Tropical cyclone Long Island Hurricane Ivan Atlanta metropolitan area Climate of Salt Lake City Dallas, Texas Miami, Florida Elis Prefecture 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Spring (season) Catastrophic Florida Hurricanes: 1900-1960 Huntington Beach, California Geography of Japan Salt Lake City, Utah Disaster Sugar Land, Texas Cyclone Climate of India Geography of Spain 1985 Atlantic hurricane season 1998 Atlantic hurricane season Houston, Texas Cody, Wyoming Hurricane Katrina effects by region Weather front Milwaukee, Wisconsin Sacramento, California Cliff Richard University of Minnesota Beaumont, Texas Tina Turner 1959 Atlantic hurricane season History of Florida Las Vegas metropolitan area Hurricane Rita Great Lakes Storm of 1913 Florida Keys Geography of Albania Curitiba Hurricane Isabel California hurricanes 1996 Atlantic hurricane season Galveston Hurricane of 1900 2005 Pacific hurricane season Weather lore California Natural disaster Asturias Fast bowling 2005 Pacific typhoon season 1950 Atlantic hurricane season Season Jon Secada Las Vegas, Nevada Spice Girls Lake Tahoe Theory of conduct Bird migration Wind 1995 Atlantic hurricane season Rich Mullins 1980 Atlantic hurricane season Tornado 1969 Atlantic hurricane season Grande Prairie, Alberta Geography of Africa Hurricane Wilma Blood on the Tracks Palmdale, California Professional wrestling attacks Gangtok National Weather Service Asheville, North Carolina Blue Ridge Parkway Frankie Laine Friends 1990 Atlantic hurricane season Time Out of Mind Monsoon The Beach Boys K__ppen climate classification Hurricane Jeanne Extreme weather Skiing Cloud 1971 Atlantic hurricane season Ithaca, New York Utah New York City EastEnders Baltimore, Maryland

what would you do buy it anyways i found my perfect house for i called and it had an accepted offer on it already subject to financing on the th i put in a backup offer anyways just in case financing didnt go through for the offer the house is vacant so i went there by myself to chck something out and there was a car so i played it cool like i had just seen the sign and stopped it was the people with the accepted offer they told me they would sell it to me for k over are they fricken nuts they have it listed one week at this price as well in the paper privately so i already have a backup offer with the original seller do you think i should put an offer in with these ripoff bastards too like maybe it is an alright deal at but no the there asking what would you do i don't want to put in an offer with them because i just cant beleive they raised the price that much without even touching it they dot know i have the backup offer the original real estate agent says she is not very confidant in the financing of seller she is selling for her parents they are aware i know what it was orinally i told them it was listed already for that price and also i am in canada and we aren't having a housing crisis or anything like that wait a minute you are not making sense here and there are red flags all over the place on this one first off it is not the seller who put in the offer if the real estate agent is selling it for her parents than that is ok now my question is this how did you find out the details of that first offer that real estate agent just did something against the law and i'm not sure i would trust her at all are you sure she is an agent or just helping her parents with the sale of their home how do you know it was the people who put in an offer they can't offer to sell a house that isn't even theirs yet yet let alone make the statements they did to you they can't even list the house officially without having title to it if you have already put in a backup offer leave it at that so you aren't brought into this situation you can't put two offers in on the same house either do not speak with these people don't put in an offer legal and binding in with them or do anything else it doesn't matter if you would offer a penny at this point red flag means possible fraud  Contract Real estate broker Microeconomics Plame affair Internet fraud Trust (Law) USA Short selling Estoppel Mediation Mortgage Paul Martin Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Property (ownership right) Tax Auction Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Insider trading Jennifer Lopez Sponsorship scandal Theory of conduct Economics LiveJournal Social rule Hyperinflation Security (finance) United Kingdom corporation tax Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Citigroup Option Donald Rumsfeld Capitalism Insurance Babylonian law Philosophical skepticism Stock Plame affair timeline Gresham's law Oil-for-Food Programme Pyramid scheme Ocean's Twelve Grandview, U.S.A.

when is it truly a good time to buy a home my husband and i have been talking about buying a home for a few months now since we are both financially stable and have a baby on the way we figure that we will need more space as she gets older and or as our family grows we have looked around in different parts of town and have found a few homes that interest us within our price range but my husband says to keep putting it off until we have more money saved since the market is going to get better i don't mind living in an apartment at all since i have mostly my whole life but at the same time i keep thinking about my daughter and how nice it would be to have her grow up in a house just like my husband and i both did maybe i am just getting impatient but i feel we have more than enough money saved to do this i know that he is just concerned that we might be on a tight budget once we buy a home any advice or anyone who has been in a similar situation obviously i don't know any specifics about you and your family but i think a lot of young people find themselves in your situation generally the best time to buy a home is now what i mean is that if you compare the economics to buying now compared to waiting a year it almost always works out that being in sooner is better financially you have an additional year for building equity the way that equity increases i am assuming that you buy in a nice area with good schools where home values will slowly appreciate is as a per centage of the home's value whereas adding to your savings only increases by the amount that you can save let's say you buy a house worth k by putting down a k down payment if you waited a year you could have k for your down payment and afford a bigger house but in the meantime somebody else who bought the house with k down has a year of appreciation let's say the house went up that is of k though that is k so you have twice as much growth as the person who waits that sort of thing is the typical way the situation would work out again assuming that you buy wisely in a nice neighborhood at least start looking seriously listing positives and negatives of different houses and even different neighborhoods don't get too hung up on the negatives every house has some either you wish the yard were bigger or you are too far from work or the kitchen is ugly or whatever keep in mind that some things can be changed and some can't like you can update your kitchen when your income grows but you are never going to be able to pick up the house and plop it into a better school district you can do landscaping and painting yourselves little by little so try to look past that stuff if you can some people can't they can only see a house as it is now that is why people make money flipping houses your baby probably doesn't know that he lives in an apartment so you have time to work on this you will probably realize that the house you really want might have to be your second or even third house not the first one but the sooner you are in your first house the sooner you will be in your second house  Microeconomics Gross domestic product Supply and demand Poker jargon Capital accumulation Annuity Personal finance Deflation (economics) Keynesian economics Life insurance Mortgage Shaggy dog story FairTax Infantilism Monetary policy PE ratio Bond Economy of Russia Freeters Surplus value Arthur Laffer Progressive tax Externality Theory of conduct Kitchen Warren Buffett Derivative (finance) Supply-side economics Social Security debate (United States) Friends Money Finance Real estate bubble Free trade Estoppel Health insurance Stock Debt Capitalism Urban sprawl Corporate finance Labour economics Common Agricultural Policy Divorce Tax Insurance Commodity markets Great Depression Monopoly (game) Economics Wheel of Fortune Money supply Humphrey Bogart U.S. public debt Law of value Philatelic investment Mergers and acquisitions Fixed income Gold as an investment Gold standard Option Stock market Internet fraud Mid-levels Publicly funded medicine Say's law Interest Quicksort Bank Taxation in the United States History of post-Soviet Russia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Islamic banking Economy of the United States The McGuire Sisters Milwaukee, Wisconsin The Inside Predatory lending Primerica Financial Services Flat tax Asian financial crisis Wealth W.

is a money merge account a good idea while looking into refinancing my mortage the broker told me about a money merge account and said it would be a great way for me to build equity and get out of debt fast we live paycheck to paycheck as it is would this really be a good idea for me or it is a gimmick not a very good explanation by the broker you should have asked him to explain further this is only my own thinking there are morgtage holders all brand new in us who carry the morgtage a person has his her entire paycheck every payday deposited into an account with the morgtage holder i understand that other debts can be held also car credit cards etc then actually a line of credit is available to the client to explain from the deposits the normal monthly morgtage payment is paid either by your check or as a draft when the payroll check is deposited on that day all the money is applied to the morgtage principle this reduces the principle for that day and any subsequent days that the money remains in the account now as above the credit line you are able to write checks from the account for any and all the bills that you normally pay every month car payment to the same company or other credit car payment to the same co or other etc groceries clothing utilities etc it's just as critical here as anytime not to overdraw your income from that account here's the kicker every day that you have a balance in the account which is reducing the principle on the morgtage on a daily basis you have saved interest on the morgtage which is equivilent to earning the same interest as the morgtage interest rate at the end of the month any balance is still applied to the morgtage principle thereby reducing the daily interest until the next payday or later if there is no balance and you have not overdrawn the amount of original deposit you have saved interest for that month even though you may not have paid down the principle since you left no balance you should be aware that saving interest every month year eventually pays off the morgtage sooner interest is calculated by the day same as credit cards in some cases a year morgtage may be paid off in years all this would have to be calculated to fully understand the savings it is sometimes stated that you earn the same interest as the morgtage rate a little confusing one is not paid that interest it's interest saved a penny saved is a penny earned right bear in mind that the morgtage holder can earn money by using your cash in the account on a daily basis in several ways money market loans etc for instance if you have a low interest loan they may be able to loan your money at a new higher interest rate this is only my understanding not carved in stone i understand this came from australia to the us you will have research to verify  Mortgage Bond Microeconomics Debt Bank Monetary policy FairTax Annuity Deflation (economics) Primerica Financial Services Tax Money supply Gold standard Social Security (United States) Insurance Mutual fund Cheque Interest Economy of Russia Short selling Internet fraud Bank fraud Finance Estoppel Citigroup Predatory lending United Kingdom corporation tax Credit score Stock Social Security debate (United States) Islamic banking Corporate finance Student loan Certificate of deposit Margin (finance) Octopus card Refinancing Payday loan PE ratio Savings and loan association Law of value Life insurance Financial audit Derivative (finance) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bretton Woods system Supply-side economics Capital accumulation Keynesian economics Treasury security Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Intellectual property Mergers and acquisitions Debt consolidation Economy of India Payroll Unemployment benefit Fiat money 401(k) Capitalism Double-entry book-keeping Hyperinflation Euro Government debt Schabir Shaik Trial Debit card Corporation Federal National Mortgage Association Fractional-reserve banking Legal tender Futures contract Unemployment Poker jargon History of the United States (1918-1945) Reaganomics Tertiary education fees in Australia Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Central bank Surplus value Investment bank Savings and Loan crisis Corporate governance Microcredit Ford Motor Company Arthur Laffer

seeking ideas on how to utilize idle land i have a half an acre piece of land in a small village town which has been lying idle for some time we planned to build our rural home when we bought it but recently we decided against it and instead bought a plot in the capital city which we are in the process of putting up a family house the small town has a few shops hotels three churches a school and the usual open air markets found in small towns i have a desire to put up something which may not be specifically commercial but that which in a way will benefit the local community there are many idle youth in the area who have taken to heavy drinking and drug abuse and i always wonder if there is sometimes i can do to help them i wouldnt mind donating the whole or a portion of the land to the local community if it can be used to improve the lives of the local community please help me with your ideas tell the town you want to donate it as a park put up a basketball goal yourself and put out a few trash cans maybe a park bench or two recruit the local garden club or school agriculture or horticulture classes to plant and landscape it if the town has a drug alcohol rehab clinic recruit those people to help too donate it to the town as a dog park fence the entire half acre and let people bring their dogs off leash to play donate it to one of the churches they could make it a community outreach of some sort to help drug alcohol abusers make it a community garden section it off in small plots and allow people from town to plant their own vegetables there in some towns people may even rent the plots to plant if they don't have their own land to do so put up a small but cheap portable building and make it a community reading room ask for volunteers to maintain it and ask people to donate their old books so kids can go there and read or take books home put up a small but cheap portable building and make it a senior center ask volunteers to run it with weekly bingo games and activities for seniors in the town rent it out as additional open air market space allow vendors to set up stands there for a small monthly fee and sell their items just hang onto it as a special use area maybe once a month or a couple of times a year coordinate with the town to hold a small town fair festival or gathering there let the churches set up booths for fundraising and sell food have some kind of entertainment there local band or school groups perform plant it in corn and in the fall have a corn maze charge admission to cover cost of corn planting hold a town raffle keep the money you make or donate it to the churches or someone needy in the town set up a museum there ask people to donate items dealing with the past or history of the town and have volunteers run it someone else in town may have an old historic building they wish to donate and move there for that purpose dig it up for a pond put a walkway around it and put ducks in it let people come fish and feed the ducks there  Grand Forks, North Dakota Animal Crossing Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory Agriculture Epcot Chatsworth House Sugar Land, Texas Fullerton, California Organic farming Boise, Idaho Lechaina Carnegie Mellon University Alcohol fuel Monopoly (game) Ernest Harmon Air Force Base Mid-levels Food Elis Prefecture Cerritos, California Fresno, California Cranford, New Jersey Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Education in the People's Republic of China MMORPG Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University Tung Chung Poker jargon University of Southern California Westheimer Street Festival Pacific, Missouri Country house Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center Salvation Army Illegal drug trade Oasis (band) University of Minnesota Assonet, Massachusetts Alcoholics Anonymous Beverly Hills, California Sukkot Knots Landing Advertising Tsing Yi Surveillance Dawson Creek, British Columbia Indianapolis, Indiana Ice cream Biodiesel Eugene, Oregon Sengkang Baseball Education in the United States P__voa de Varzim Wrigley Field Homewood, Illinois Dogpatch USA Health insurance Emergency preparedness National parks of England and Wales Pasadena, California Taxation in the United States Microeconomics Wan Chai Scientology beliefs and practices Nintendo Entertainment System Zuiderzee Works Texas A&M University Yearbook Embedded system RISC Agricultural policy Organic food King City, Ontario Mission, British Columbia Genetically modified food Dairy Champaign-Urbana Metropolitan Area Food and Drug Administration Hopkins School Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Mortgage RuneScape quests Spokane, Washington South Beach Carlsbad, California Common Agricultural Policy X Window System Milpitas, California Portland, Oregon Urban planning Insurance

what are some things to justify the cost of a house whats considered good quality and whats bad quality you can use any measure to justify the cost if a house the final justification is what will someone buy this house for in this market it is as simple as that concerning appraisals generally a real estate agent or an appraiser will first start with comps competitive prices for other similar properties in that neighborhood normally they check those comps and firct break them down into a cost per square foot basis for each house this will give them a range for how prices are going in that area that will give them a range of prices say from sqft to sqft from there you just look at your property check to see how it is quality wise if everything is top notch compared to the other properties it will be in the sqft range if it is in poor shape more towards the sqft range in this example if it is in good shape but doesn't have all the conveniences of some of the others poorer design etc then in the middle somewhere good quality bad quality is simply what do buyers in that area consider important an outdoor pool in southern california is a huge selling point but in alaska it is not in some places a c is not really important but in arizona it is mandatory with central air a big positive against only evaporative coolers in one neighborhood where it is all upscale homeowners then upgraded kitchens and gold fittings in the bathroom is a huge plus but a few blocks away in a primarily rental area then just basic appliances and fittings are much better for value so these are all local questions depending on the market for that town and even that neighborhood  Microeconomics Supply and demand Mortgage Economics Kitchen Real estate appraisal Tax White flight Gross domestic product Inflation Insurance Surplus value Real estate broker Paintball Binoculars Capital accumulation Toyota Camry Natural monopoly Bicycle lighting Illegal drug trade Property tax Mutual fund Labor theory of value Cable television Free market Free trade Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft Carlsbad, California Law of value Education in the United States Mattress Monopoly Property (ownership right) Theory of conduct RISC New Urbanism Harlem Commodity FairTax Urban sprawl Monopoly (game) E85 Sugar Land, Texas Deflation (economics) Technical analysis Scottsdale, Arizona Berkshire Hathaway Yacht Urban renewal Carburetor Welding Price discrimination Sport utility vehicle Goodness and value theory Fair market value Nintendo Trademark Model (economics) Housing cooperative Political economy Transformation problem Public housing Normal distribution Externality McMansion Prices of production Supply-side economics Diving suit Commodity markets Intellectual property Marketing Islamic banking Autonomous building Chevrolet Camaro Wall Street Warez Diamond Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Economic calculation problem Gold standard IBM PC compatible Solar power Plastic MMORPG CPU cache Mainframe computer Leasing Real estate bubble Milwaukee, Wisconsin Productive and unproductive labour Incandescent light bulb Sears Holdings Corporation Public policy

renting apartments please try to answer all my questions thanks is it the responsibility of the owner or renter to pay the bills for mowing the lawn and pool maintenance what usually happens when the carpet get dirty is the owner or renter responsible for cleaning it how long do people typically change their carpet is it reasonable for the renter to ask the owner to change the carpet or is that the renter's problem thanks these things should be discussed between the landlord and renter before a lease is signed if it's a large apartment complex the landlord normally takes care of lawn and pool maintenance if it's a house it may be up to the renter when the carpet gets dirty while being lived in by the renter then the renter needs to vaccuum it would take a lot of wear and tear i would think to need to actually change the carpet sometimes it's done between renters if needed if you're talking about getting it cleaned before moving in then you should see if the landlord is getting is done professionally before you move in everything should be clean and ready for you when you move in or i would consider looking elsewhere for a place to live as far as changing the carpet completely you can ask but the landlord doesn't have to do it unless it's in horrible condition  Rental agreement Leasehold estate Boston and Lowell Railroad Apartment Gentrification Housing cooperative Public housing Lawn mower Lawn The Young Ones (TV series) Extreme Programming Motor oil Avenue Q Irish Land Act Social rule Robot Tennis Babylonian law Intellectual property Miss Saigon Carpet Ownership Radio controlled car Home repair Prostitution in Germany Palms, Los Angeles, California Waste (law) Sento Estoppel Absentee landlord Life insurance History of Santa Monica, California Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Stuyvesant Town Insurance Buckingham Palace Computational complexity theory Apartment building Animal Crossing Squatting British House of Commons Sauna American Psycho The Inside Taxation in the United States Public domain Leasing Surplus value Swimming pool Nortraship Rent (musical) Construction It's All Gone Pete Tong CPU cache Contact lens Bedbug Theory of conduct Gardening Suburbs of Johannesburg Yugo Pitaten Diving Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia Scouting Babe Ruth Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Drill bit Capitalism Stairway Computer virus Home insurance Microeconomics Friends Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Strap-on dildo Anarchism and capitalism McMansion Carburetor Land use forecasting Queensbridge Abortion debate Only Fools and Horses Minor characters in Seinfeld Real estate economics Publicly funded medicine Airport The Commons George Costanza Justification (theology) Dial M for Murder Surveillance Upholstery Fort Ashby, West Virginia Robert Moses Vista Way Minor league baseball Expert system Scottish clan Body piercing

my father made a financial gift to me to assist with buying a home k can he ask for this back legally a contract requires for consideration to be provided on both sides only things passed under a contract can be enforced to be given back a contract does not have to be in writing so the question is does a contract exist a contract only exists if their is consideration from both persons ie a job contract one provides the work the other money sale of a car one provides the car one provides the money consideration must be a commercial deal equal and fair ie along the lines that a bank would do otherwise its seen as a gift it helps to have something in writing though as your dad could say it was a loan we agreed she would pay it back one day it would be difficult for both of you to argue in a court of law without something in writing another consideration on this is tax your father will have to pay capital gains tax on this gift capital gains are only exempt if the gain is less than k although your father did not sell anything so he didnt a gain it is seen that his capital assets have fallen so there may be some tax implications get some proper advise as if this gift was made recently you may be able to do something so he can reduce the tax maybe make the gift over a few years so he uses his k allowance each year this would also mean something is documented just to give you peace of mind the person above talking about the it income tax coming after you for gitfs of more than k is talking about inheritance tax though this is only a worry if your dad is likely to die in the next years is he if so again get some tax advise as he is liable for this tax but if he is dead they look to the persons benefited from his estate which could well be you if he has no other assets all this inheritance stuff is only valid if he has assets worth more than about k  Tax Life insurance Microeconomics Contract Corporation United Kingdom corporation tax Taxation in the United States Inheritance tax FairTax Article One of the United States Constitution Leasing Islamic banking Mortgage Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mutual fund Surplus value Insurance Bond Capital accumulation Annuity Trust (Law) USA Deflation (economics) Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Divorce Security (finance) Tax haven Free trade Flat tax Estoppel Derivative (finance) 401(k) Labor-power Warren Buffett Productive and unproductive labour Economy of India Capital gains tax Copyright infringement of software SCO-Linux controversies Wealth Property (ownership right) Tax protester Progressive tax Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Donald Trump Enron Corporation Privatization Personal finance GNU General Public License Property tax Government debt Bretton Woods system Copyright Money Income tax Hyperinflation Credit card Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Trust (Law) non-USA Anarchism and capitalism Value added tax Money supply Inflation Wal-Mart Monetary policy Variable universal life insurance Investment bank Health insurance Citigroup Intellectual property Keynesian economics Publicly funded medicine Income trust Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Parliament of the United Kingdom Allodial title Trade union American individualist anarchism Civil union Gold standard Apprenticeship Babylonian law Social Security (United States) Hedge fund Conflict of interest Real estate broker Law of value Finance Mediation Political corruption

what are your top tips for a first time home buyer i am thinking of buying a condo or townhouse but i am scared i will make a mistake so perhaps you can share your best tips for buying a home this is something that i give all of my first time home buyers top tips for first time homebuyers by eric bramlett purchasing your first home is a big step that comes with some very serious decisions many homebuyers are intimidated by the process and continue renting much longer than they should or need to however if you break the homebuying process down into these simple steps and follow these important tips you will find the process less intimidating and much more manageable before you begin ask yourself one question will you live in your next home for at least years if the answer is yes you should probably purchase rather than continue renting with average appreciation you'll break even on your closing costs after years and start making money at year three every year after that will put more money in your pocket the most expensive aspect of real estate is buying selling so the longer you can live in the home the better however purchasing makes sense if you can make as little as a month commitment you don't need a down payment it always surprises me how many people want to purchase a home but don't because they believe that a hefty down payment is required zero down programs are very common and are quickly becoming the norm rather than the exception to the rule because your new home is collateral for the loan there are many banks that will jump at the chance to loan you of its value perfect credit isn't a requirement either because real estate typically appreciates in value it's often easier to be approved for a mortgage than it is to borrow for a car get pre qualified pre qualification is a very important step and the step that first time home buyers dread the most qualifying to buy a home is pretty easy and requires relatively little work for you pre qualification is what gives you buying power and allows you to make an offer on your dream home when you've found it more importantly pre qualification will let you know how much your new home will really cost in monthly payments a or home doesn't mean a lot to most buyers but per month and per month are tangibles that everyone can understand after your lender pre qualifies you ask them for a payment table that shows you a rough estimate of total monthly payment based on purchase price pick your payment and you know the price range to shop in consult a real estate professional asap many first time home buyers avoid contacting a real estate agent because they dislike high pressure sales however real estate agents have an advantage over traditional salespeople because they have access to the multiple listing service which is a database that lists roughly of the homes for sale in a given market this means that your real estate agent doesn't have to sell he she merely presents your options the most important qualities to look for in your real estate agent are his her knowledge of your specific market and their willingness to help interview a few agents and choose one that will help guide you through the process you'll find the help insight will be invaluable and you'll be glad you contacted your real estate agent sooner rather than later make a list of must haves wants many new home buyers mistakenly think that they will just know when they walk into the one while some buyers do fall instantly in love with a home this is not the norm you'll find your search is easier and you will be more confident in your decision if you take a systematic approach to your search the best way to organize your search is to make two lists your must haves and your wants your must haves are the absolute necessities in your new home in fact you don't even need to view a home if it doesn't have every must have great examples of your must haves are price school district size etc your wants are the qualities that you would like for your new home to have but it's not a necessity great examples of wants are color flooring kitchen appliances surround sound and type of exterior by taking the time to articulate what you need and want in your new home you will know exactly what to look for when viewing prospective homes pick your favorite neighborhoods you can always make changes to your house but you can never change its location most home buyers already have a good idea of where they would like to live because of school districts work or other factors however neighborhoods can be pretty different even in the same area of the city ask your real estate agent to email you a list of homes in the specific area of town you're interested in take a drive through the different neighborhoods on the list your real estate agent sends you and choose your favorites pay attention to area amenities how well the yards common areas are kept and if you see a lot of for lease signs which can be an indication of a heavy rental area and lacking in pride of ownership after you have picked your favorite neighborhoods and you know your must haves and wants you can literally make a list of every home available that meets your criteria and view those homes make your decision homebuyers often hesitate after they've found the right home because they're not confident about their decision or their decision making process your home is probably the largest investment of your life and it's normal to feel butterflies in your stomach before putting your first home under contract however if you do your due diligence and you have if you followed the steps above then you will have your bases covered if you've found a home that meets all of your must haves most of your wants is in the right neighborhood and in your budget it's the home for you don't wait and let another buyer take your home buying your first home can seem very intimidating but can be extremely exciting if you think that buying a home is right for you it probably is make sure and follow these important tips and you'll know you made the right decision when you find your first home good luck if you want

how can i change my last name in house deed loan documents the answer is yes and no the in order to change the deed a new deed must be drawn up call your local title escrow attorney you used to purchase the home and they can do this for you it fairly simple but it will be at a cost imo doing this is not needed it does not hurt anything to have your deed in your old name if you have the opportunity during a refi i would do it then you will save money as they already have the information if you want to change the loan documents this can not technically be done the documents are recorded and they do not get changed you can contact your lender and advise them of your name change send them the proper documentation and they will change your name in the system so new mailings reflect the change in name  Mortgage Real estate broker Advance fee fraud Student loan Predatory lending Insurance Attorney at Law Domain Name System Title insurance Bank Interest Bond Annual percentage rate Monetary policy Direct marketing Education in the People's Republic of China Plame affair Deed Deflation (economics) Islamic economics United States v.

did i lose my lease i am now living with a bunch of roommates and my lease is month to month however one of my roommates is planning to live elsewhere so is there a possibilty that the three of us is moving since my landlord won't approve of someone new to the lease it all depends on how the lease was worded generally if each roommate was named as a tenant on the lease if one leaves the lease is broken you can try to renegotiate with the owner if you want to continue with the lease by either finding a new roommate to replace the exiting one or for the remaining roommates to agree to pay the whole rent between all increase in per person amount but the owner doesn't have to re rent to you and might raise your rent if you've been excellent tenants paid on time never gave anyone any problems didn't damage or break anything etc the owner may want to keep you on rather than have to go through the whole new tenant procedure or rather than having the apartment vacant and depending on what the laws on in you area a month to month might serve you well you should read your area's laws on rentals to see under what conditions an owner can evict tenants might be that if you remain in good standing the owner won't be able to evict you and you can just continue with a month to month until everyone decides to go elsewhere  Leasehold estate Leasing Eviction Rental agreement Waste (law) Estoppel Concurrent estate Renting Apartment Housing cooperative Stuyvesant Town Public housing Avenue Q Rent (musical) Apartment building Rent control Babylonian law Art Modell Irish Land Act Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Capitalism Squatting Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Property (ownership right) Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Serfdom Monopoly (game) Value added Boston and Lowell Railroad Property tax Friends American individualist anarchism Manorialism Japanese law Real property Auto insurance First-sale doctrine Anarchism and capitalism CPU cache Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Racecourse Ground Public domain Intermediate consumption Inflation Prostitution in Germany Satchel Paige Harlem Surplus value Gentrification Government of Maryland Contract Eminent domain Judiciary of Hong Kong Property law Annuity Queen of Wands The Amazing Race Microeconomics ABC No Rio Wrexham A.F.C.

is it ok to be removed as a co buyer from home i'm buying with fiance she said that her mortgage company said it would eliminate some extra hassles with doing a credit check on me if the loan was in her name only however they insisted that the contract on the home be drawn up again removing me as a co buyer this sounds strange to me since it looks like i'm not involved in the purchase however they're telling me that my name will still be on the title for the home is this ok that's perfectly fine no they are not lying to you if we have a buyer that can qualify alone then we usually will use one buyer especially if the co borrower does not have enough credit questionable employment etc also some lenders require that only the name of the borrower be on the purchase contract you definately have nothing to worry about as long as your name is on the title good luck  Mortgage Insurance Financial markets Predatory lending Debt Islamic banking Bank Deflation (economics) Conveyancing Security (finance) Title insurance Monetary policy Futures contract Government National Mortgage Association Capitalism Stock Real estate Student loan Mergers and acquisitions Bond Citigroup Primerica Financial Services Finance Economics Microeconomics Gold standard Annuity Home insurance Interest Life insurance Supply and demand Bank fraud Internet fraud Article One of the United States Constitution Option Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Savings and loan association Real estate bubble Unconscionability Hire purchase Ford Motor Company Annual percentage rate Money Great Depression Credit card Subsidy Usury Babylonian law Money supply Price discrimination CBS Contract Credit derivative Arbitrage Betting (poker) Timeline of the Enron scandal Payday loan Federal National Mortgage Association Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Debt consolidation Margin (finance) Personal finance ACORN Irish Life and Permanent Advance fee fraud Monopsony The Amazing Race Derivative (finance) Mortgage-backed security Privatization Sears Catalog Home Ethical consumerism Construction Wells Fargo Enron Corporation Credit history Credit union Tennessee State Constitution Warranty Oakland Athletics Foreclosure Hyperinflation Schabir Shaik Trial Corporation Lender of last resort Procurement Central bank Taxation in the United States Short (finance) 401(k) Repurchase agreement Coercion Digital rights management 2004-05 in English football Consumer finance Commodity Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation

pre home construction question new home construction i was looking up property online and was wondering what the cost would be to hook up the utilities the lot i was interested in is in town and the description states that the elec water is at the street also is it more expensive to have a home with a large footprint or one with a small one thats multiple stories thanks there are homes in the area the lot is partially cleared surrounded by large trees and doesn't require a septic tank when talking about additions to a house it is always less expensive to add to the ground floor rather than adding another story so i would assume the same would be true when building originally tapping into utilities can get costly but there is even more expense getting to the access point for example it costs abou to tap into the water another to tap into the sewer where i live but that isn't including what it costs to pipe from the house so if you have a deep lot it may be quite a bit more i don't know what the electric company charges but i do know they will charge you for the meter which cost like around here i suggest you speak to your builder about these costs in your area  Autonomous building Septic tank Water supply Wind turbine Sewage treatment Mach kernel Solar power McMansion Seismic retrofit Energy development Irrigation Bungalow Microeconomics Kitchen Construction Transformer Solar panel Mars, Pennsylvania Wind power Manitoba Hydro Rapid transit Hydropower Geodesic dome Roof and tunnel hacking Theory of conduct Renewable energy Electrical wiring Solar power satellite Tesla coil High-voltage direct current Nuclear power CPU design Ocean thermal energy conversion Electric power transmission Cruising (maritime) Supply and demand Insurance Zerg Natural gas Dundas Square Welding Lechaina Hydrogen economy PlayStation 3 Adjoint functors Urban sprawl Quicksort Wardenclyffe Tower Collapse of the World Trade Center Extreme Programming Easement Natural monopoly Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Straw-bale construction Naval mine Thermal power station Property tax Telephone tapping Independent Subway System Items in the Metroid series King City, Ontario Halting problem Software patent debate Bong CPU cache Digital circuit G__del's incompleteness theorem Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Economics Drill bit West Side Highway Protoss Bass guitar Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Gas metal arc welding Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Gross domestic product Chopper (motorcycle) Life insurance SimCity 4 Langmuir probe Wildfire Tank landing ship Windows XP Alternative fuel Cray-1 Big Dig Mixed martial arts Atari 8-bit family Taxation in the United States BASIC programming language Montr__al-Mirabel International Airport Milton H.

why does it matter how much you put for a down payment the buyer gets the agreed upon price anyway so why does it matter if they get it in the beginning or the end or why does it matter how much they get in the begining if you go with a pre approved letter they know you have the money so why does it matter and you get your down payment back anyway if you dont want to the place it doesn't matter to the seller it matters to you and the mortgage company companies are more willing to finance a loan with a larger down payment i e smaller loan amount plus you'll pay lower interest with a larger down payment  Bond Islamic banking Security (finance) Government National Mortgage Association Student loan Supply and demand Debt Insurance Microeconomics Financial markets Gold standard Mortgage-backed security Derivative (finance) Collateralized mortgage obligation Life insurance Capitalism Internet fraud Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Bank Annuity Price discrimination Dividend Tax Money 401(k) Unconscionability Credit derivative Savings and loan association Stock Futures contract Predatory lending Monetary policy Mergers and acquisitions Interest Option Title insurance Short selling Put option Interest rate Donald Trump FairTax Hyperinflation Federal National Mortgage Association Primerica Financial Services Real estate bubble Government debt Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Rational pricing Credit card Subsidy Health insurance Islamic economics Taxation in the United States Schabir Shaik Trial Bretton Woods system Call option Municipal bond Fixed income Annual percentage rate Just price Keynesian economics Personal finance Finance Mutual fund Economy of the United States Arbitrage Lehman Brothers Advance fee fraud Federal Reserve Stock market Credit default swap Microcredit Babylonian law Real estate Surplus value Privatization Gross domestic product Margin (finance) Credit score Oil-for-Food Programme United Kingdom corporation tax Contract Citigroup Consumer finance Technical analysis Social Credit Marshall Plan Tertiary education fees in Australia U.S. public debt Collateralized debt obligation Hire purchase B__rgerliches Gesetzbuch Refinancing Securitization Ponzi scheme Great Depression

is adding swimming pool increase house value how much is the estimated value if you add a pool to the property please state a reason why it will or will not add value as you've probably deduced from the answers you've received their is no correct answer to this question in my neighborhood it's a negative if you don't have a pool but even that depends on the prospective buyer some buyers don't want the hassle liability of a pool my advice if you want a pool and the usefulness justifies the expense put it in and enjoy it if you get a little more money for your house later because of the pool consider it a bonus we put ours in last november and love it down here miss gulf coast we use it year round it's heated  Microeconomics Jeopardy!

can i consolidate mortgages on homes into one loan to my benefit i have two mortagages from two lenders on two houses is it possible to consolidate and have one loan from one bank covering the two homes what sort of benefit or disadvantage would this entail i'm sure its possible at some banks though most would not want to do it right now its very possible to get some sort of umbrella loan usually you do this with lots of properties you want to bundle together still to do this banks would hate it just easier for them to keep each property seperate and what if you decide to sell one house down the road but keep the other you couldn't do that without refinancing again also i can't think of any advantage beyond a tiny savings in cost to get the loan only one closing needed for example but this would actually be a cost for you since you already have mortgages on both properrties so its just a bad idea won't help any and causes all sorts of hassles you could instead simple have the bank write you two seperate loans for both properties at the same time if you wanted assuming you are planning to refi them both now they'd be much happier to do this  Mortgage Primerica Financial Services Debt consolidation Insurance Savings and loan association Predatory lending Debt Central bank Deflation (economics) Interest Student loan Federal National Mortgage Association Life insurance Bank Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Government National Mortgage Association Subsidy Washington Mutual Leasing Real estate broker Citigroup Monetary policy Irish Life and Permanent Bond Annual percentage rate Donald Trump Title insurance Personal finance Payday loan History of the United States (1918-1945) Externality Islamic banking Islamic economics 401(k) Extreme Programming Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Foreclosure Unconscionability FairTax Real estate bubble Short selling Financial markets Derivative (finance) Bretton Woods system Microcredit Mortgage-backed security Real estate Economy of Russia Gold standard Mobile home Security (finance) Fee tail Anarchism and capitalism Soci__t__ G__n__rale CPU cache Conveyancing Indian reserve Finance Refinancing New Deal Easement Home insurance Intellectual property CPU design Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory Handelsbanken Popular, Inc ACORN Annuity Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Concurrent estate Bank of America Free trade Microeconomics Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Savings and Loan crisis Stamp duty Capital accumulation Great Depression Temasek Holdings Privatization Corporation EastEnders Kasparov versus The World RISC Mach kernel Construction Trade Credit card Collyer brothers Productive and unproductive labour Property tax Toronto-Dominion Bank Urban renewal Emirates Stadium National Australia Bank Real estate developer Leeds United F.C.

when dealing with pmi do first time home buyers have to have it what if we own land then will that be considered within the and if not what if we put money and land toegther to equal will we still need to get pmi you do not necessarily have to have it i'll assume you own some land a lot or a couple acres if you are looking to build you will need to get a construction loan also referred to as an interim loan this will finance the actual construction of the house once the house is complete the interim loan is converted into a traditional mortgage unfortunately for you the value of the land cannot be used to offset the requirement for pmi also the calculation for the is done off the interim loan not the appraised value of the completed house so you'll need to come up with around of the construction costs upfront extra percentage to cover closing costs inspections appraisal etc in order to not have pmi a quick example you land is worth you've found a builder whose total construction cost is the appraised value of the property after construction is expected to be so you'll need to have about cash at the start of construction which means you'll end up with a mortgage on house and no pmi you don't necessarily need that much cash if you're willing to pay pmi final note you could take out a home equity loan on the house but only after the house has seasoned in most markets this means that the house has been on the tax rolls for at least a year at this point you can have the house re appraised and take out about of the appraised value without incurring pmi hope this helps  Mortgage Primerica Financial Services Bond Life insurance Security (finance) Islamic banking Microeconomics Tax Personal finance Property tax Construction FairTax Real estate bubble Money Debt Margin (finance) Mobile home Annual percentage rate Mutual fund Stock Student loan Derivative (finance) Federal National Mortgage Association Real estate broker United Kingdom corporation tax Real estate developer Real estate Supply and demand Deflation (economics) Title insurance Corporate finance Annuity Interest Contract Donald Trump Real estate appraisal Urban renewal Housing cooperative Inflation Economy of Russia Capital accumulation Gold standard Government National Mortgage Association Capitalism Betting (poker) Hyperinflation Municipal bond Monetary policy Financial markets 401(k) Taxation in the United States Mergers and acquisitions Credit card Mortgage-backed security Craps Option Social Security debate (United States) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Monopoly (game) Paintball Yield curve Interest rate King Ranch Economy of India Weighted average cost of capital Cost of capital Temasek Holdings Divorce Oil-for-Food Programme Collateralized debt obligation Toll road Finance Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Variable universal life insurance Bretton Woods system Tertiary education fees in Australia Islamic economics Stamp duty Berkshire Hathaway Citigroup School of Salamanca Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Labor theory of value Wealth Warren Buffett The Criterion Collection Wal-Mart Value added Money supply U.S. public debt Dividend Debt levels and flows Social Security (United States)

how can you make money flipping houses i was reading on the internet that if you sell a property in under two years that you have to pay a large capital gains tax are all your repair receipts ect tax deduct thank you yes they are deductible as you have read the capital gains structure is two tiered if you sell in less than year you'll pay income tax on the profit as ordinary income if you sell after one year but before two you pay a capital gains tax that is higher than if you wait until after year two this market is not a flipping market any longer the liquidity squeeze that we've seen over the last week is going to cause a ripple effect in my opinion that will see the housing market drop in value significantly i'm not quite doom and gloom like some that predict a drop but i do think that is realistic that would kill any profit you get from a cosmetic fix and flip if you were looking into one of the many tv ad systems that promise huge profits in days like one i saw last night check out the source on the internet most of those people have complaints and lawsuits out the wazoo they use some valid techniques that some states allow and others don't so check with your local real estate attorney  Tax Taxation in the United States Flat tax United Kingdom corporation tax Insurance Microeconomics Surplus value FairTax Supply-side economics Annuity Capital accumulation Income tax Productive and unproductive labour Gold standard Capitalism Mortgage Mutual fund Progressive tax Health insurance Income trust Credit card Reaganomics Deflation (economics) Life insurance Inflation Keynesian economics Inheritance tax Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Security (finance) 401(k) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Internet fraud Warren Buffett Bretton Woods system Bond Property tax Operating surplus Privatization Economy of Russia Arbitrage Gross domestic product Short selling Measures of national income and output United States Postal Service Logic Poker jargon Value added tax Tax bracket Value added Education in the United States Publicly funded medicine Tax avoidance/evasion Employee stock option Social Security (United States) MMORPG Leasing Tax Reform Act of 1986 Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Public transport Money Trickle down effect Social Security debate (United States) Derivative (finance) Model (economics) Software patent debate Income statement Anarchism and capitalism Economic rent Google Dividend imputation Tariff Speculation Ponzi scheme Cost of capital Corporation Value product Labor theory of value Tax protester Hyperinflation Criticisms of socialism Public policy Income Monopoly Economy of India Trademark Illegal drug trade Airline Day trading Monopoly (game) Unemployment Trust (Law) USA Profit Natural deduction Phase (matter) Babylonian law

mortgage advice property portfolio i have k in savings i want to buy a house for k therefore need a k mortgage if i buy the house and remortgage it to buy another one how much capital will be available to me will it be the k for the value of the house i think i understand what you are saying and this should help to buy a buy to let property typically a lender will look for quite a substantial deposit depending on who you go with so going buy your plan if you buy your house for k with a k mortgage and then remortgage it you should be able to get about k which of course you could invest in new properties you will then be paying interest on the full k plus whatever additional borrowing you have taken on in order to pay for the second house its difficult to advise you on the best way to fund all this without knowing the details of how and when you are buying all the properties however you need to sit down and think about how much you can afford to be repaying how much you need to set aside for repairs and vacant periods how quickly you will need the second property and how much of a benefit it would be in having large amounts of capital available immediately rather than having to rely on a remortgage my basic advice would be if you are buying one property and will then look to build upon this over a number of years when you find another one you might well be best served reducing your mortgage payments with a large deposit if however you are looking to extend you portfolio in months rather than years it may be easier and more cost effective to retain more capital in savings and rely on a larger mortgage to fund the first and second purchase good luck  Mortgage Bond Mutual fund Life insurance Bank Student loan Islamic banking Insurance Debt Annuity Taxation in the United States Personal finance Money Federal National Mortgage Association Finance Credit card Microeconomics Leasing Savings and loan association Predatory lending Financial markets Interest 401(k) Capital accumulation Monetary policy Capitalism Primerica Financial Services History of the United States (1918-1945) Security (finance) Marshall Plan Title insurance Microcredit Municipal bond Government debt United Kingdom corporation tax Gross domestic product Citigroup Wells Fargo Social Security (United States) Short selling Government National Mortgage Association Real estate bubble Inflation Gold standard Hyperinflation Toronto-Dominion Bank Bretton Woods system Annual percentage rate Great Depression Variable universal life insurance Derivative (finance) Futures contract Privatization Housing cooperative Mortgage-backed security Donald Trump Monopoly (game) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Free trade Real estate Tax Subsidy Anarchism and capitalism Trust (Law) USA Temasek Holdings Social Security debate (United States) Real estate broker Treasury security Concurrent estate Yield curve Keynesian economics Rational pricing Registered Retirement Savings Plan Real estate developer Islamic economics Health insurance Irish Property Bubble Construction Saving (economics) U.S. public debt Supply and demand Mergers and acquisitions Estoppel Labor theory of value Money supply Economy of India Rental agreement Public transport Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Software patent debate CPU cache Securitization Schabir Shaik Trial

how can i rent a house with bad credit tried private owners but even they are checking credit these days private owners are asking when you fill out their rental application that you pull your own credit report and attach it to the app what can i do to overcome this i've been employed with the same company for yrs why does this not prove i am trustworthy having bad credit proves that you can't be trusted to pay your bills on time simple fact of life i'm afraid that said some folks with poor credit are in that boat because they paid their rent first and let less important bills slide that is the smart way to handle financial difficulties since you have to have a roof over your head as priority number if you fit this profile contact your prior landlords and ask them to verify your dependability for paying your rent on time keep looking there are landlords who will base their decision on other factors than just your credit record though it will take some legwork to find them  Mortgage Credit card Estoppel Taxation in the United States Leasing Capitalism Public-key cryptography Housing cooperative Rental agreement Insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Renting Public housing Accounting methods Leasehold estate First-sale doctrine Life insurance Property tax Bluetooth Auto insurance Stuyvesant Town Anarchism and capitalism Pretty Good Privacy Economy of Russia Capital accumulation Money Internet fraud Harlem Surveillance Car handling Economic rent Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Rent control Phishing Interest Tire Schabir Shaik Trial Procrastination Primerica Financial Services Annuity Corporate governance Divorce Public domain Wayne Corporation Article One of the United States Constitution Eviction Allodial title Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Call centre Poker jargon Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Identity theft Copyright law of the United Kingdom Plame affair NP (complexity) Economic inequality Babylonian law Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Universal Studios Octopus card Health insurance Interactive proof system Monetary policy Appeal Social Security (United States) Property (ownership right) Apartment Model (economics) Monopoly (game) IP Multimedia Subsystem Microeconomics Killian documents Section 8 (housing) Parasite singles Government debt Probation officer Explosive material Rest area Value added Electricity meter Slot machine Babe Ruth Online DVD rental Commodity markets Netflix Credit repair Cheque Karl Rove Deflation (economics) General aviation Inflation Automatic number plate recognition Fair use Law of value Screw Student loan Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Freenet Bank fraud

cntg no ko im not sure if the buyer agents will still be bringing potential buyers to a property if the home is under contigent no kick out status can someone please clarify i found out this from the web but not sure still to further clarify listings with cntg no ko have contingencies that need to be worked out but no kick out clause these contingencies are commonly inspection and financing the buyers may not get financing or the inspection may turn up issues that the buyers do not want to deal with so there is still a chance that the contract may fall out however the only time there is a contingency that the buyer sell their house first is a kick out which would allow another buyer to submit an offer and the first buyer would either have to remove that contingency or the second buyer would get the contract in nova that's listed as cntg ko once this status is up there you will proably pretty much see all interest dry up if the property is really well priced you might get a little interest and even a back up offer but this essentially means we have a contract and aren't really looking for another right now still go ahead and put in a back up if you want  Real estate broker Contract Insurance Mortgage Security (finance) Conveyancing Annuity Option Put option Call option Microeconomics Stock B__rgerliches Gesetzbuch Oakland Athletics Capitalism Auction Internet fraud Standard form contract Supply and demand Credit derivative Arbitrage Islamic banking Privatization Stock market Unconscionability Illegal drug trade Coercion Oil-for-Food Programme Government National Mortgage Association American Broadcasting Company Economics Advertising Futures contract Divorce Financial markets Labor theory of value Bond Martial art Insider trading Economic relations of Japan Corporate finance Investment bank Iraq and weapons of mass destruction GNU General Public License Rational pricing Economy of Nigeria Dividend Option style Risk management Technical analysis Copyright law of the United Kingdom Tax Hire purchase 3dfx Mergers and acquisitions Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Finance Gold standard Real estate bubble Same-sex marriage in Canada Freelancing on the Internet Enron Corporation Margin (finance) Beverly Hills, California Estoppel Inventory Price discrimination Citigroup Construction Google Derivative (finance) Los Angeles Clippers Ford Sierra Naming rights MG Rover Group Babylonian law Philosophy of business Trademark Politics of Russia Harlem Monetary policy Property (ownership right) United Kingdom corporation tax LiveJournal Free software Leasing Liberty Dollar RKO Pictures Subscription business model Land reform in Zimbabwe Atari Li Ka Shing Life insurance Bumiputra Newstead Abbey Mattress Gambling Ford Motor Company Denis Law

landlord trying to keep most of my security deposit what can i do i didn't take any pictures regretfully most of the deductions were already existing in the home or normal wear and tear how am i supposed to prove this is hiring a lawyer going to cost me more than the refund if it is indeed normal wear tear as you say then the landlord may have trouble proving that first thing you need to do is do some research on tenant landlord law in your state most states have some specific timelines and requirements but it is up to you to find out know what those are to stand up for yourself speaking just for il rules the landlord is supposed to provide you within days what is being deducted and what for and must return any remaining portion within days you have the right to see copies of the actual bills for materials labor if it was a nornal wear tear item such as carpet then the landlord may need to show what it was you had done that you should be charged for replacing it as others have said in the end this is probably going to be an expensive lesson for you bottomline is no one is going to look out for and protect your rights as well as you can as one who has been a renter in the past and who is a landlord now i can tell you just as many renter horror stories as landlord horror stories bottomline is this a lease is a contract the time to protect yourself from harm is before you sign it i use a move in move out checklist which my tenant fills out at move in and notes pre existing conditions they sign it and it is part of the lease file i can also tell you that in the cases where i have not returned security deposit rarely does the forfeited security deposit cover the cost of bringing the unit back to rentable condition in conclusion many landlords don't follow the rules on days to notify and days to return so that is your most likely avenue of success after that unless you are willing to do the research represent yourself pay the upfront costs filing fees service fees etc and or you feel confident you have a winnable case you may wnat to chalk this up to an expensive lesson i suggest you read this article before you sign your next lease http realestate msn com rentals article aspx cp documentid  Rental agreement Leasing Leasehold estate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Taxation in the United States Public domain Plame affair United Kingdom corporation tax Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Renting Insurance Eviction FairTax Babylonian law Lawyer Intellectual property Waste (law) Tax Mortgage Contract Serfdom United States Postal Service First-sale doctrine Appeal Blockbuster Video Public housing Welding Housing cooperative Monopoly (game) Wal-Mart Credit card Copyright Islamic banking Mutual fund Concurrent estate Copyright law of the United Kingdom New Deal Boston and Lowell Railroad Social Security (United States) Apartment Legal research Spontaneous human combustion Fair use New York Jets Life insurance Roswell UFO incident Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) American individualist anarchism Mach kernel Solar cell Medical malpractice Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Student loan Karl Rove Tort reform British House of Commons Tennessee State Constitution Transformation problem President of Germany Treaty Spyware Romer v.

real estate investment with no own money involve no credit check etc is this true i see a lot of advertisements on craigslist re real estate investment with no credit check no own money involve etc is there any truth in this i would like to get involve in real estate investing hoping that it will be a pathway to financial freedom but i have no money to invest baby s yes you can invest in real estate without your own money as i'm pursuing this now as my new career the thing you have to remember is that what you would be doing is dealing with those homeowners who have found themselves going through the 'foreclosure process' meaning they have fallen about months behind on their mortgage and their lender usually a bank has started the 'foreclose' process if you check your local paper you'll see back in the real estate section ads entitled notice of default this is a mandatory process all lenders must due once you've found a homeowner going through the foreclosure process you then negotiate what is called a short sale with the lender google the term real estate short sale note include the then go through the the first url's that are returned and you should then get the gest of what and how short sales work another way of investing in real estate is through a process called wholesaling how this works is you still find those homeowners who are going through the foreclose process however they're not as far along as those who would be candidates for a 'short sale' you talk to the homeowners to find those who are motivated to sell now and thus are open to taking a lower amount then what the house would typically sell for you put the house under contract which can honestly be done for less then and then before you close on the property find another investor who would be willing to buy the house from you fix it up themselves and then resell it months later here is an example of how that would work homeowner needs to move now because of job promotion out of state or even because of a 'divorce' does not have time to wait for house to sell under normal process find realtor do a 'open house' etc etc needs to sell now and is willing to take any offer just to get out from under the loan house is appraised at say minus of market value or if house needs any repairs carpet paint ect etc minus those costs from amount factor in a wholesale profit of say now your offer to the homeowner would be appraised value or repairs example wholesale profit example offer to homeowner homeowner accepts offer during the days or so it typically takes to 'close' on a loan you find another investor from ads like you've seen on craigslist com or from signs you may see in your area that say we buy houses you provide the information on said home to investor if the investor decides to buy the house then you turn around and sell it for any price above the you offered to the original home owner so imgaine if a house was appraised at you picked it up from the owner for if you then turn around and sell it to the investor for say even if the house had about worth of repairs needed the investor could still turn around re hab the house and sell it for the apparised values a few months later thus allowing everyone in the transaction to walk away happy homeowner is happy because the house sold quickly and can now move on with whatever they want to do you you walk away from the closing with x xxx cash in hand investor profits just as much as you did if not more but only after they rehab house and sell it heck they might even keep the house rent it out and have a positive cash flow every month of course there are other factors to take into consideration but that is the general jist how it works in real estate investing when you put a house under contract this can actually be done for about dollars i highly recommend you check out the following website for more information and read some of the posts by other investors who are making money from this process www flippinghomes com once the page comes up click on the link that says forum and feel free to read through any all the posts from fellow investors so you can get a better understanding of how real

if a landlord fails to collect rent or even make contact with a tenant for year do they then have the right a relative of mine has been renting a house and two years ago he attempted to pay rent one month and discovered that the landlord had up and dissapeared he would continually seek out this person to pay them their rent but none of the phone numbers worked and the landlady never came by to collect rent for two whole years does this lady now have the right to demand back rent in full for two years this happened in california by the way i suspect they probably do have the right to collect the rent statue of limitations is still not running ie they can still legally get a judgement for this money the debt is not old enough to be uncollectable still i can't believe they would actually expect to get the money after so much time if i were the tenant i would try to make a deal with them to pay maybe the last months worth of rent if they will forego the rest if the tenant flat out refused to pay anything they'd have to evict them and still probably not get the rent then take them to court and all sorts of other stuff long story short i'm not sure what they could collect from the tenant when all was said and done but probably less than months worth of rent if the tenant simpy wouldn't pay so since they are likely to get less tahn months rent if they do an eviction its probably in the landlords best interest to take months rent and move on problem is this doesn't sound like a very smart landlord so maybe they won't take any deal anyhow i'd say offer a few months back rent to forget the whole thing and see if they can make a deal for some of the back rent also although i do think the landlord can try to collect all back rent its hard to do this and they may end up getting only part of the rent  Leasehold estate Estoppel Eviction Monopoly (game) Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Leasing Rent control Irish Land Act Microeconomics Rent (musical) Squatting Art Modell Housing cooperative Harlem Mortgage Public housing Property (ownership right) Annuity Economic rent Rental agreement Michael Davitt Renting Money Scottish clan Poker jargon Land reform Concurrent estate Insurance Apartment American individualist anarchism Waste (law) Stuyvesant Town Property tax Contract Serfdom Unreformed House of Commons Absentee landlord Therion (band) Judiciary of Hong Kong Sin City Capitalism Tithe Knots Landing Interest New Deal Deflation (economics) Debt Schabir Shaik Trial Surveillance Credit card History of Ireland (1801-1922) ABC No Rio Neoclassical economics Barrister Thomas de Littleton Anarcho-capitalism Satchel Paige 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Land use forecasting George Moore (novelist) Economics Real estate bubble The Super Milk-chan Show Manorialism Craps Enron Corporation Toyota Prius Jack Lang (Australian politician) Plame affair Irish Land League FairTax Assignment (law) EastEnders Warren Buffett Yield curve Capital accumulation Public policy Security (finance) Economy of Russia Motion picture rating system Blackjack Economy of Africa Rovers Return Slippery slope French nobility Great Depression Divorce Neville Chamberlain Section 8 (housing) IBM PC compatible Black Books Life insurance 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression

why in some places why is real estate so cheep also in places houses are for sale for around dollars why and whats the deal and the catch depending on the area of the united states you plan to purchase a house it really has a lot to do with the availability to build additional houses in the los angeles for instance there is no land to build any new houses what so ever what little land there is to build a house is expensive and will cost the same as the house next door when completed in the south there is still lots of vacant acreage to build houses on especially in places like arkansas alabama georgia and mississippi i imagine there are other states in the south also that have cheap houses for sale but those are the ones i have visited and looked at the prices of houses since they are not located in a large city they are cheaper to build thus making them a lot cheaper to purchase i hope this has been of some use to you good luck fight on  Microeconomics Urban sprawl Mutual fund Supply and demand Real estate appraisal Illegal drug trade Bulk vending Wal-Mart Beverly Hills, California White flight Arbitrage Tax Louisiana Purchase Taxation in the United States Opportunity cost Mortgage Auction ITunes Music Store State university Burbank, Los Angeles County, California Confederate States of America Hydrogen economy Real estate broker FairTax Monopoly (game) Campbell, California Carlsbad, California Suburb CPU design 109th United States Congress Stars!

how do you sign over a house to someone privatley my auntie brought my nans house for k a couple of years back she now says she wants to sell it and is getting it valued the idea is that my nan will move in with my sister and my auntie will use the money from the house to build an extension for her now i want to put an offer on the table to her basically instead of selling the house i want to enter into a private mortgage with her instead so i will pay her every month and then borrow against the house to get my nan her extension and move into the property the question is how do i go about such a thing spending as little money as possible on any legal costs i live in the uk if i am understanding you correctly you want to have your aunt carry a silent first mortgage meaning she wouldn't record the loan with the county it would just be between you and her you would pay her on a monthly basis and then you would get an institutional loan once you are on title to the home against the property the only problem with that is that its illegal not to mention it would screw your aunt out of the equity in that home since the loan you would be getting would take first position it would get ugly if things went south some states do not allow the transfer of title without the consent of the current lien holder or requires that that lien loan be paid in full even if you can transfer title without paying off the loan on the house you will run into a seasoning issue most lenders will want you to have made months payments before they allow you to take any cash out of the house you may be able to accomplish it with private money lenders or hard money but the interest rates are not low with the current state of mortgage lending it may be even more difficult there are ways to accomplish what you are trying to do you could just buy the house from her for a reasonable price and just make a deal with her that a certain amount be given to your nan so she can put the extension on the property if she would be willing to take payments then maybe she would be willing to help you put an extention on the house after she gets a lump sum i suggest you talk to several good mortgage brokers in your area they would be familiar with the laws in your state  Bond Insurance Debt Money Student loan Predatory lending Security (finance) Life insurance Annuity Government National Mortgage Association Deflation (economics) Gold standard Economy of Russia Microeconomics Stock Credit card Bank Title insurance Citigroup Federal National Mortgage Association Financial markets Annual percentage rate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mortgage-backed security Inflation Hyperinflation Derivative (finance) Privatization Capital accumulation Copyright Real estate bubble FairTax Gross domestic product Intellectual property Mutual fund Temasek Holdings Islamic economics Interest Central bank Donald Trump Allodial title Leasing Tax Anarchism and capitalism Money supply Mergers and acquisitions American individualist anarchism Economy of the United States Capitalism Personal finance Usury Margin (finance) United Kingdom corporation tax Economy of India Taxation in the United States Concurrent estate Savings and loan association Housing cooperative Bankruptcy in the United States Property (ownership right) Social Security (United States) Keynesian economics Government debt Rational pricing Construction Education in the United States U.S. public debt Divorce Poker jargon Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Primerica Financial Services Bretton Woods system Contract Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Labor theory of value Debt consolidation Political economy Social Security debate (United States) Schabir Shaik Trial Surplus value Flat tax Municipal bond Futures contract Corporate finance School of Salamanca Financial services

do i have to give a down payment my husband and i are looking to buy a house we're currently living in an apartment complex paying a month we don't want to stay here too long because we could be using those towards paying our own home we've found a house in dallas and my mother in law said that when they bought their home they didn't have to give a down payment since they were first time buyers she said they only had to pay the closing cost which was about we don't have any money to give towards a down payment but we want to get out of the apartment as soon as possible is this true can we buy a house without a down payment if we're first time buyers considering today's market yes you need a down payment the mortgage industry is heading downhill due to financing interest only financing and soft home sales i understand that you want to move out of the apartment but it is best to wait a bit and save up for a down payment you can do this by reducing other extra expenses such as eating out going to the movies shopping etc by having a down payment you are more likely to qualify for financing also you are protecting yourself from the market if you get financing and the appraised value of your home decreases then you will owe more money than what the house is worth this is a situation the bank wants to avoid thus requiring a down payment if you don't think you can save for a down payment then you should not be buying a house yet the problem with the mortgage crisis is that people who could not really afford the house they bought due to be financially stretched thin are now in foreclosure  Insurance Great Depression Life insurance Real estate broker Personal finance FairTax Bond Money Health insurance Microeconomics Islamic banking Debt Predatory lending Mutual fund Mergers and acquisitions Deflation (economics) Taxation in the United States Economy of Russia Real estate bubble Primerica Financial Services Government National Mortgage Association Credit card Tax Annuity History of the United States (1918-1945) Futures contract Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Financial markets Bretton Woods system Gross domestic product Government debt Student loan Capitalism Housing cooperative Publicly funded medicine U.S. public debt Security (finance) Internet fraud Price discrimination Capital accumulation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Federal National Mortgage Association 401(k) Freeters Wal-Mart Economy of the United States Divorce Privatization Campaign finance reform Inflation Economy of India Savings and loan association Monetary policy Delta Air Lines Finance United Kingdom corporation tax Arbitrage Interest Unemployment Gold standard Surveillance Mortgage-backed security ACORN Free trade Illegal drug trade Child support Keynesian economics Stock Leasing Rational pricing UK Singles Chart Treasury security Social Security (United States) PE ratio Enron Corporation Salary cap Mensal__o scandal Short selling Municipal bond Inventory Economics History of post-Soviet Russia Annual percentage rate Surplus value Dividend Toyota Prius Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Euro Option Federal Reserve Allodial title

can i live the security deposit until i move out the apartment no rae the security deposit is to cover any damages that may have been done to your apartment you may talk to the landlord about it but they are within their right to say no on that you can however insist on an immediate inspection and ask that your deposit be returned the day that you move out just make sure the apartment is perfectly clean and undamaged that even includes the little holes in the walls from hanging pictures a good trick it to use some white toothpaste to fill in the tiny holes and use you finger to smooth it out completely then follow up with a damp rag to clean off any smudges left from the toothpaste this has worked for me in the past and i've always gotten my entire security deposit back the day i've moved out rae raji the green witch  Seismic retrofit Solar cell Diamond Weezer Drill bit Phoebe Halliwell Tooth Toothpaste Kitchen Opportunity rover Glacier Aerial (dance move) The Inside Carburetor Diatom The Time Machine Internal ballistics 1957 World Series The Subtle Knife G-Man (Half-Life) Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Mouth ulcer The Apprentice 2 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Carlsbad Caverns National Park Unfaithful (film) Battles of Lexington and Concord Rental agreement Autostereogram Bong Sento Hamster Motor oil Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Invisibles Chess terminology Computer animation Sin City Casting Typewriter Violin What Makes Sammy Run?

what exactly happens when your house gets foreclosed on i think i might be close to it happening if the bank takes it back that means im clear of the loan and any second mortgages right i know my credit score will be crap foreclosures are not treated like other loans they are considered deeds the federal government does not allow for collection of deeds so if you are foreclosed on it is not treated like a car loan or credit card it is basically where you can just walk away the federal government gives you the right to again purchase property months after the foreclosure date as long as the rest of your credit is ok mortage companies are folding left and right big banks will be left with the properties as far as mortgages go they usually look at the last months of your credit history foreclosures here is a website that lists the laws procedures and timelines for foreclosures in each state http www foreclosures com pages state laws asp good luck  Mortgage Foreclosure Great Depression Concurrent estate Government National Mortgage Association Allodial title Predatory lending Money Bond Bank Real estate Federal National Mortgage Association Deflation (economics) Student loan Monopoly (game) Debt consolidation Citigroup Islamic banking Credit card Real estate broker Irish Life and Permanent Personal property Debt Personal finance Bank of China (Hong Kong) Title insurance Bank of America Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Craps Short selling Corporation Monetary policy ACORN Stamp duty Unconscionability Insurance Bank fraud Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Donald Trump Universal Studios Microcredit Phishing Wells Fargo Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Savings and loan association Taxation in the United States Credit score Popular, Inc Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Primerica Financial Services Securitization Collyer brothers 401(k) Dave Ramsey Neopets Mail Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce United Kingdom corporation tax Economy of Russia Citizens Electoral Council Security (finance) Credit card fraud Municipal bond Bankruptcy in the United States Life insurance Soci__t__ G__n__rale Credit history Money supply Estoppel Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Usury Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Toronto-Dominion Bank Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory Washington Mutual Mortgage-backed security Internet fraud Betting (poker) Government debt Central bank Grover Cleveland Wardenclyffe Tower Islamic economics Habitat for Humanity International Education in the United States History of the United States (1789-1849) Gold standard Contract Interest FairTax Credit union Hyperinflation History of the United States (1918-1945) Octopus card Union Bank of the Philippines Real estate bubble Russian history, 1855-1892

what is a home equity loan i'm trying to learn more about home equity loans what are they what situation do you have to be in with your mortgage to qualify how many years into the mortgage etc and what the credit requirements are any info will be helpful thanks there are two types of equity loans the eloc meaning equity line of credit or the fixed rate home equity loan the eloc is a line of credit against the value of your home it varies in amounts and can be as much as of the home value think of it as a credit card with a limit that equals the value of your home based on an appraisal minus the amount you owe if you do not use this loan you may only have an annual fee of it is something that is nice to have in case of hardship or a large purchase in case of hardship you will probably not qualify for a loan of this magnitude and if it is a large purchase like a car the interest will still be tax deductible this loan is driven by the prime rate similarly to a credit card the prime rate on the last day of the month in the wall street journal plus a certain amount of percentage based on you credit and how much you borrow vs how much your house is worth ie ltv the fixed rate home equity loan is a loan generally over years which has a fixed payment and the rate is never going to change as you pay on this loan your princable is going to decrease a good option for people looking to do a remodel project which costs x amount of dollars it is good to pay off debt home improvement projects or large purchases basically one time spends the eloc can be used constantly if you pay off your eloc it still is there ready to be used just like a credit card your credit has to be decent becuase this is a second lien on your home and doesn't carry as much weight as a first lien the rate will reflect this but if you have good credit and equity in your home i would recommend to everyone to have an eloc it is a perfect tax deductible emergency fund  Student loan Insurance Deflation (economics) Annuity Bond Microeconomics 401(k) Life insurance Tax Monetary policy Inflation Predatory lending FairTax Security (finance) United Kingdom corporation tax Futures contract Bank Primerica Financial Services Islamic banking Personal finance Social Security (United States) Capital accumulation Hyperinflation Stock Flat tax Real estate bubble Gross domestic product Money supply Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Federal National Mortgage Association Property tax Annual percentage rate Corporate finance Mortgage-backed security Cost of capital Credit score Bretton Woods system Capitalism Municipal bond Auto insurance Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Gold standard Weighted average cost of capital Mutual fund Food Stamp Program Supply-side economics Variable universal life insurance Savings and loan association Debt levels and flows Supply and demand Mergers and acquisitions Social Security debate (United States) Deficit spending Publicly funded medicine Title insurance Derivative (finance) Unemployment Labor theory of value U.S. public debt Islamic economics Bank fraud Government National Mortgage Association Public policy Collateralized debt obligation Microcredit Debt consolidation Financial services History of the United States (1918-1945) Income tax Refinancing Tax deduction Allodial title Finance Income statement Economy of El Salvador Progressive tax Private equity Education in the People's Republic of China Poker jargon Tertiary education fees in Australia Modigliani-Miller theorem Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Trust (Law) USA Driver's license Toll road

i want to quit my job and be at home more with my new baby which is better real estate agent or appraisal keeping in mind we rely on my salary i am in real estate school right now and have to warn you the market is so bad i don't suggest either if you decide to go for it though you are better off starting with your real estate license because to become an appraiser here in indiana you not only need to know what is taught in that class but you will need an appraisers class as well as being an apprentice it is really hard to find an appraiser to take you under their wing since you will be competition for them this is exactly what my r e teacher said just last week once you get your r e license you can work a year under a broker then get your brokers license once you have both take a class in mortgage financing this last few months has been really hard on that industry with over major players going under the job market there is tight as heck but soon enough the government is doing a bail out to help but by that time many of the workers will have moved on congrats on the new baby as a business owner my suggestion to you is to do a great deal of research for your area before jumping in they say on average it takes months for you to make your first sale and the yearly average is sales if you are in a ballooned area watch for the pop last thing think about buying hud homes and fixing them up then carrying the mortgage many peeps these days can't get conventional mortgages or keep them if you carry the mortgage yourself you can build equity then expand the draw back is this takes quite a bit of time to pan out i have sold nearly houses in the last years for a company that does this i work mainly on down payment fees and it has been worth it  Mortgage Real estate broker Mutual fund Insurance Government National Mortgage Association Donald Trump Real estate Federal National Mortgage Association Capital accumulation Housing cooperative Primerica Financial Services Intellectual property Construction Short selling Property tax Graduate school Taxation in the United States Debt Wells Fargo Unemployment Predatory lending Bond Mortgage-backed security Citigroup Life insurance Great Depression History of the United States (1918-1945) Security (finance) Corporate governance Islamic banking Real estate appraisal Personal finance Economy of Russia New Deal Student loan Title insurance Toronto-Dominion Bank Real estate bubble Warren Buffett Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Habitat for Humanity International Monopoly (game) Deflation (economics) Business Advertising Berkshire Hathaway Oakland Athletics Google White flight Finance Copyright NASDAQ Microeconomics Real estate developer Copyleft Lawyer Tesco Annuity Nintendo Trademark Commodore International Delta Air Lines Investment bank Wal-Mart FairTax Carl G.

why would an apartment or condo allow dogs but not cats usually its no pets or cats allowed i've only seen it listed where dogs are allowed but not cats what is the reason behind this because traditionally landlords have had problems with cats spraying and destroying the carpets it is hard to get that smell out you have to even replace the base boards etc good luck  Cat Red Dwarf characters Fancy rat Skunk Luck Tooth enamel Manx (cat) Black Condominium Pet skunk Taboo food and drink Pekingese Care Bears Flea Pet Ferret Domestication Pep__ Le Pew Monopoly (game) Jack London Three Gays of the Condo Atari 8-bit family Leasehold estate Toilet humour Cloning Felis sapiens Pedigree pet food Spotted Skunk Neopets Rabies Animal communication German Shepherd Dog "Weird Al" Yankovic Livestock Dog The Fairly OddParents Socialization Carpet Baldrick Domestic rabbit Maka dai dai shogi Carnivore Get Fuzzy Apartment Cats (musical) Maison Ikkoku Dennis the Menace (UK) Keeshond Veterinarian Spider-Man Hamster West Highland White Terrier Dog training Beagle Black cat Tobacco smoking College Roomies from Hell!!!

real estate careers i'm in college about to start my senior year for fashion and retail management but i'm starting to doubt if it's something that i want to do for most of my life i've noticed that i'm very interested in real estate sometimes i browse the internet to look at apartments and houses in other states just for the fun of it plus i'm constantly looking at real estate shows on television i think i'd be interested in real estate appraisal is this a good field to go into can you tell me what type of training is necessary college degree certificate etc what type of salary do real estate appraisers make would it likely be worth it for me to change career paths i don't know what planet luisa has been on but although re appraisal can be difficult to get into it is a good field appraisals are in demand whether houses are selling or not appraisals are requested by lenders attorneys for divorces and settling estates insurance companies and people buying and selling houses appraising can be challenging you have to do much more than take pictures and find comparables to place a value on the house you have to have construction knowledge too the requirements to be an appraiser vary by state so you will want to check that out in my area you have to apprentice with an experienced appraiser and the local appraisers haven't been willing to have apprentices to avoid competition  Mortgage Donald Trump Real estate Real estate appraisal Lawyer Insurance Microeconomics Federal National Mortgage Association Paralegal Life insurance Title insurance Mutual fund Tax Education in Germany Hartford, Connecticut Ocean's Twelve Inflation The Apprentice Bank Attorney at Law Property tax The Apprentice 2 Quizbowl Apprenticeship Annual percentage rate The Apprentice 2 candidates Real property Business Bond Trust (Law) USA Education in the United States Google Neopets Finance Notary public Valuation (finance) Citigroup Van Sweringen brothers Real estate economics Supply and demand Primerica Financial Services NASDAQ School counselor Education in Australia Model (economics) Guild Price discrimination Motion picture rating system Jennifer Lopez Warren Buffett Worldwide ERC Health insurance Maryland General Assembly Election, 2006 Mediation Alois Hitler Annuity Unemployment Wells Fargo Capital accumulation Concurrent estate Council house Deflation (economics) Fullerton, California Publishing Teacher Student loan Professor The Amazing Race Conveyancing Carlsbad, California Airsoft Economy of Russia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Freeters Corporate governance Oakland Athletics Emerson College Road-rule enforcement camera Insider trading The Apprentice 1 Amtrak Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act The Apprentice 3 Predatory lending William Hogarth Trinity College, Dublin UCAS Barry Minkow Construction Taxation in the United States Tai Chi Chuan Rob Portman Monopoly (game) Babylonian law American individualist anarchism Auction Physician Blackjack

how does it work when you buy a house on auction if the house is appraised at does it start at or lower it usually starts at a real low number whatever the auctioneer thinks is low and they try to bid people up from there however they usually also have a reserve ie a price below which they will not sell the property if for example the house is appraised for k but the owner is willing to take k then k is the reserve but they may start bidding at k or even lower if the bidding does not get to the k number but dies at say k they simply say the reserve price was not met and the housee is not sold and no they won't tell you the reserve beforehand bear in mind that setting up an auction takes alot of time and money so if the reserve is not met the seller lose so they truly want the home to sell also bear in mind there are fees and usually a above the price that goes to the auctioneer so even if you bid k you may need to come up with k closing costs and k auctioneer fee also foreclosure auctions are similiar but work a little differently but the differences are key still not going into that here may not interest you  Mortgage Auction Ra (board game) Mutual fund Arbitrage MMORPG Online auction business model Foreclosure Monopoly (game) Mikhail Kasyanov Supply and demand Central bank Shill Economy of Russia Final Fantasy XI Real estate broker Gross domestic product Deflation (economics) Internet fraud Monetary policy Intellectual property Microeconomics Day trading Euro Stock Inflation Donald Trump Predatory lending Housing cooperative Bond Ford Motor Company Insurance Labor theory of value Privatization Call option Put option Futures contract Capitalism Surplus value Real estate appraisal Money supply Option Conveyancing Gold as an investment Fair market value Leasing Contract bridge Live 8 Public good Sit-up Ltd Paintball Rational pricing Anarchism and capitalism Initial public offering Economics Technical analysis Dividend Textbook Supply-side economics Price discrimination Commodity Foreign exchange market Hyperinflation The Apprentice 2 Commodore International American individualist anarchism Real estate economics Market system Estoppel Wal-Mart Islamic banking Stud poker Network effect Exchange value Reverse auction Real estate bubble Asian financial crisis Jack Tramiel ITV Monopoly Speculation Property tax Insider trading Security (finance) Corporation Illegal drug trade Experimental economics $ale of the Century Valiant Comics Winner's curse Tax Debt consolidation Value added tax Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Atari 8-bit family FairTax Liberty Dollar YUKOS

i just purchased my first rental property it is a single family home br bath and i was wondering if i should volunteer to pay for their water bill or should i make them be responsible for paying it i want to be a good landlord but i don't want to be taken advantage of hi sean there's really nothing set in stone about whether the tenant or the property owner pays a water bill whatever you decide the most important thing is that you clearly state your policy in writing and have your tenants agree upon it the clearer you are upfront the less likely you'll have disputes later on since you want to be a generous landlord but are concerned about being taking advantage of why not adopt a compromise state in your agreement that you'll pay their water bill up to say per month that way you can generously cover their water expenses without having to finance the waterslide that your tenants decide to set up in the backyard since you're new to property management i've pasted an article called tips on being a successful landlord from allbusiness com's library below if you want further information and forms for renting your property check out the landlord tenant section of our website http

what's the best way to minimize taxes on profit from selling real estate i buy fix up and sell houses i also have a pretty high paying job which puts me in a high tax bracket typically i would have to pay my high income tax on the profit from selling a house or i can wait one year and just pay capital gain on the profit how can i minimize my taxes on the profit when selling a fixed up house within one year of its purchase if you sell such a property in one year or less you do not qualify for capital gains treatment and must add the entire profit to your regular taxable income hold it more than one year and you fall under capital gains taxation treatment you might consider consulting a qualified tax accountant to see if you can somehow engage in a exchange program which will keep rolling your profits into the next purchase without current tax liability  Tax United Kingdom corporation tax Taxation in the United States Microeconomics Mutual fund Capital gains tax Surplus value Progressive tax Corporation Property tax Inheritance tax Flat tax Insurance Income tax 401(k) FairTax Leasing Gross domestic product Annuity Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Dividend Inflation Tax avoidance/evasion Value added tax Income trust Trust (Law) USA Productive and unproductive labour Measures of national income and output Credit card Dividend imputation Hedge fund Bond Supply-side economics Deflation (economics) Security (finance) Capitalism Labor theory of value Income statement Supply and demand Monopoly (game) Publicly funded medicine Keynesian economics Variable universal life insurance Double taxation Gold standard Bretton Woods system Tax haven Operating surplus Economic rent Warren Buffett Municipal bond Personal finance Mergers and acquisitions Consumption of fixed capital Taxation in the United Kingdom National Insurance Islamic banking Regressive tax Money Economy of the United States Social Security (United States) Anarchism and capitalism Tax treaty Economy of Russia Illegal drug trade Tax cut Tax bracket Wal-Mart Tax protester Reaganomics Real estate bubble Article One of the United States Constitution Real estate broker Protectionism Taxation in Canada Value added Poker jargon Business Health insurance Income Short selling Stamp duty Limited liability company Bulk vending Day trading Intermediate consumption Treasury security Lloyd's of London Donald Trump Externality Citigroup Libertarian economic views MMORPG Hyperinflation

help my apartment flooded and i think there is mold my apartment has flooded three times since i moved in to it in march not to mention how many possible times it flooded before that i think there is mold and i think i am allergic i am having asthma like symptoms and had to see a doctor about it the same week that we moved in i have to use an inhaler every night anyway i am wondering if i should have an inspection done on the apartment and if i can break the lease or anything like that if there is mold and i am allergic to it i also have a months old and am weeks pregnant can i break my lease anyone experience anything like this or know anything about breaking leases call the county building inspector and explain the problem and they will send someone out to do a mold test however here is the catch if the inspector finds that there are elevated levels of mold spores and condemn the apartment you get to break your lease but must vacate immediately if he condemns it that means it is unsafe for human habitation and that is what he is legally bound by just so you know what happens yes you are under no obligation to stay in a place that constantly floods the legal term is constructive eviction ps you need to find another place for your month old to stay for awhile black mold takes weeks to set up in a child's lungs and can cause respiratory bleeding and death if you are experiencing symptoms imagine what your month old is going through  Asthma Allergy Leasehold estate Toxic mold Pregnancy Insulin Hay fever Obstetrics Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Pneumonia Aspergillosis Tobacco smoking Childbirth Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Air pollution Abortion Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Breastfeeding Medicine Prostate cancer 2001 anthrax attacks Miscarriage Urinary incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Lung cancer Coeliac disease Menstrual cycle Terri Schiavo Miss Saigon Cocaine Traumatic brain injury Iraq and weapons of mass destruction The Inside Casting Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Animal testing Psoriasis Pulmonary alveolus Nitrous oxide Cystic fibrosis Stroke Asbestos Hypoglycemia Bong Malaria Radiation poisoning Common cold Multiple chemical sensitivity Leasing Eczema Kibbutz Chlorpromazine Endometriosis Methamphetamine Acute respiratory distress syndrome Human adaptation to space Smallpox Contract Flood Haloalkane Arthur Mold Alcoholism Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Medical record Aspartame Cytomegalovirus Milton H.

should we invest in a buzzer intercom system or apartment keys for apartments my friend i have read and studied all the pros cons of apartment keys and buzzers intercom systems for apartments which one is best suitable for an apartment i think they are both fine buzzer is more convenient but you will have people slipping in when others are buzzed in or just asking everyone to buzz them in which some people will do so maybe a bit less safe i'd just look at other apartments in teh area see what they do and do the same can't go wrong that way  Quizbowl Scrabble (game show) Avenue Q Key telephone system Whose Line Is It Anyway?

what should i say to our landlord we are in a year lease and need to break it or sublet it i am months pregnant and currently live miles from any relatives we are going to need their help when the baby comes and we have found a new house that is closer to my mom and brother and aunt's and can move in today if we wanted how do i approach my current landlord we do have a friend that can finish the rest of our lease and has great credit and a good backround and is willing to move in as soon as we move out whats the best way to start off the conversation to break our lease should i do it over the phone or in person do you think he will understand and not charge us any penaltys help i would approach the landlord in person if possible don't forget that a landlord is usually looking at profit and loss and does not look at the situation as emotionally as a tenant who considers the place their home he will probably be fine with it especially if you have a friend who can take on the lease before you go do check your contractual terms what are the conditions on breaking a lease are there any penalties you need to know where you stand so that you can speak confidently broach the subject starting with explaining about your pregnancy and then ask whether he would prefer to take on your friend as a tenant or that you would sublet the property and let him choose between those two options if you make it as effortless as possible as it seems you already have done by finding someone to take the lease on he really shouldn't have a problem  Leasing Leasehold estate Babylonian law Friends Contract Estoppel The Amazing Race Social rule EastEnders Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Rental agreement Melanie Wilkes Eviction Waste (law) Neighbours Pregnancy Sexual orientation Schabir Shaik Trial New York Jets Concurrent estate Charmed Property law Manorialism Shaggy dog story Real property Microeconomics Knots Landing Sharon Tate Burglary Hubert H.

can you lease a house with poor credit i was trying to buy a house but go tinvolved with the wrong mortgage broker and she lowered my score from a low to some of them into the high fours and low fives grrrr well i am currently living in a home owned by my mother but she wants to sell it so i am probably going to have to move out and i have two large dogs so i know my odds of leasing are much better than renting an apartment i just want to make sure that people who lease out homes work with people with limited credit and if i explain it to them and they look at my inquiries then i know i will have to lease for at least a year to get my credit back up to where it needs to be to buy a home i was just wondering if they tend to be more leniant of it the just look for broken leases or what not i worked with a mrotgage broker and she lowered my credit from low s to high s and low s she did this by sending me to several different programs all i wanted to do was buy fha and she said my dti was too high and that it was hard and this and that i am jsut not convinced she knew what she was doing i later switched to another broker but by that time i was in the low 's and it was just rough trying to get it worked out just how did this broker lower your rating so much it depends on the person who is renting the house astute ll's pull a credit report and go from there edited to add that explanation only makes sense if your credit report was pulled over times in a period that exceeded a day period it could have been pulled a within the first days and would not count against you but time  Mortgage Housing cooperative Mutual fund Leasing History of the United States (1918-1945) Insurance Short selling Student loan Citigroup Leasehold estate Citigroup Center Miss Saigon Arbitrage Real estate broker Monopoly (game) FairTax Battery electric vehicle Gross domestic product Predatory lending Boston and Lowell Railroad Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Monetary policy Deflation (economics) Tide Credit score Day trading United Kingdom corporation tax Supply and demand Mobile home Cable television Federal National Mortgage Association Airline Diode Emerson College Aerial (dance move) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act New Deal Mergers and acquisitions Real estate bubble Tesco Microeconomics Berkshire Hathaway Money Identity theft Apartment Derivative (finance) National Certificate of Educational Achievement Technical analysis Good Times HIV test First-sale doctrine Debt White flight Equine conformation Government National Mortgage Association Taxation in the United States Wells Fargo Dominoes WEPN Weight training Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Farmers' Alliance Car handling Stock Appeal Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Pump It Up Sin City Grade (education) Humphrey Bogart XERF United Artists Annuity Flat tax Intelligence quotient Security (finance) Bulk vending Meat Loaf Warren Buffett Urban sprawl Stamp duty Hard disk Discordianism Public housing Squatting Friends Surplus value Economic rent Brewery Free trade Avenue Q Islamic banking Digital photography Speed of light Inflation Plame affair Los Angeles Clippers Abigail Folger

how do they determine the cost of construction loans how does that process work as far as what we take the loan our for and what are we paying per month im trying to see if we can handle the cost of that loan and our current mortgage we just did this and just finished our house i know there are many different types but with ours we paid the accumulated interest every month and only paid interest on the loan during the construction period each month we would turn in our amount to be reimburst and we would pay the interest on the total amount that was taken out so far so in the beginning it wasn't bad but towards the end was in most cases the construction loan has a higher interest rate than when you roll it over to a mortgage so those last couple months are brutal and we actually paid more those months than we actually have a monthly payment now but seems like when were looking every bank had their own version of a construction loan so be sure you check around also we moved into our house before it was done so we could save almost months of paying both payment although we were renting at the time but our rent was still just as expensive as a house payment luckily we had a basement we lived in had no real kitchen for a month or carpet but we had a working bathroom so it was okay being that it was just me and my husband we could do it but if you have kids i am sure it would be much more difficult  Mortgage Student loan Interest Insurance Savings and loan association Life insurance Credit card Annuity Real estate bubble Bond Debt Government National Mortgage Association Deflation (economics) Annual percentage rate Bank FairTax Federal National Mortgage Association Money Leasing Mutual fund Hyperinflation Collateralized mortgage obligation Interest rate Primerica Financial Services Gold standard Subsidy Monopoly (game) Derivative (finance) 401(k) Economic rent Payday loan Harlem Anarchism and capitalism Surplus value Housing cooperative Predatory lending Savings and Loan crisis Bretton Woods system Capital accumulation Unemployment Refinancing United Kingdom corporation tax Leasehold estate Economy of the United States Islamic economics Inflation Real estate developer Microcredit Social Security (United States) Credit score Consumer finance Flat tax Gross domestic product Mortgage-backed security Tertiary education fees in Australia Basement Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Schabir Shaik Trial Federal Reserve Yield curve Compensation of employees Certificate of deposit Social Security debate (United States) Money supply Security (finance) Donald Trump Property tax Tuition Babylonian law Title insurance Municipal bond Corporate finance Rental agreement U.S. public debt Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Cheque Capitalism Mobile home Government debt Bank fraud Debt consolidation Tax Productive and unproductive labour Treasury security Blackjack Freeters Universal life insurance Variable universal life insurance Cost accounting Mensal__o scandal Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Knots Landing Unemployment benefit

i rented a house put down a deposit but the owner foreclosed on the house how do i get my deposit i have put a large deposit on a house that i am renting i just found out that the house has sold at a foreclosure sale i'm not sure if it went back to the bank or a third party i have no problem moving i just would like my deposit back who owes me the deposit i'm in missouri it was a very non formal contract so it doesn't have stated who is going to pay the deposit but in my previous rentals the new owner paid the deposits back i just need to know where the law stands on this issue hate to say it but it's fairly likely you have been screwed if you paid a deposit to the previous owner and that person didn't put it in escrow they have the money now they are obviously insolvent the money is probably spent you could sue them for your money back and you would win however considering that their house was just foreclosed on the likelihood of you collecting on a judgement is fairly slim if you want to play total hardball if you can prove that the house was in foreclosure when you signed your contract and paid your deposit you might be able to prove fraud and go for criminal prosecution adam  Contract Credit card Allodial title Leasing Tom DeLay Advance fee fraud Annuity Schabir Shaik Trial Public domain Bankruptcy Universal Studios Internet fraud Security (finance) First-sale doctrine Tax Bond Patent Estoppel Salary cap Mary Astor Housing cooperative Appeal SCO-Linux controversies Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Mikhail Khodorkovsky Oil-for-Food Programme Renting Government of Maryland Bankruptcy in the United States Divorce George Galloway Life insurance Enron Corporation Trademark Deflation (economics) Babylonian law ACORN Surveillance Corporation Money Oakland Athletics Fred Phelps Savings and Loan crisis Karl Rove Extreme Championship Wrestling Plame affair Dred Scott v.

is investing in real state is riski or safer im yrs old engg graduate im indian citizen i am a biggnerr in real estate i just want to know whether investing in real estae is more riskier than saving money is there are some ideas regarding investing in real estate profitably without any kind of risk shuold we trust agents with any investment there will always be risk you didn't say where you would be interested in buying the market being what it is today in the us do not look for short term profits unless you are willing to put in time and energy fixing up old houses and renting them out the one bright spot in my area has been commercial highway frontage my town is growing into a small city with many new strip malls going up in florida tax sale notes can be a good investment the interest rates are higher than what you would get from a bank and if the owner does not redeem the note during the two year period the property is yours look at the property first to make sure it is something that you want to own many people also use the reit or real estate investment trust to spread out the risk and not have their eggs in one basket agents only get paid if a sale is made i am a realtor and i have seen many good eggs and some rotten ones in my profession agents owe their clients a certain amount of disclosure if they know of defects that a property has a lot depends on the type of representation that they are giving you whether they are working as a buyer's agent solely on your behalf or as a transaction broker which enables them to work both sides of a deal some states do not permit this but florida where i am licensed does your contract to purchase should have a specified time for you to perform your inspection and due diligence feasibility study make sure you do your own due diligence or hire outside professionals such as inspectors do not depend on your agent to do your work for you also you may want to ask around regarding the quality of inspectors and appraisers since the home inspectors hired by the agent who represented us when we bought our home before i was licensed myself were not good  Mutual fund Real estate broker Insurance Mortgage Islamic banking Corporation Bank Life insurance Microeconomics Capital accumulation Bond Annuity Mergers and acquisitions Security (finance) Debt Investment bank Trust (Law) USA Monetary policy Short selling Tax Hedge fund Income trust Citigroup Inflation Deflation (economics) Leasing Rational pricing Derivative (finance) Intellectual property Arbitrage Real estate developer Real estate Privatization Credit card Primerica Financial Services Ethical consumerism Microcredit Stock Title insurance Finance Institutional fund management Babylonian law Donald Trump Futures contract Gold standard Economy of Russia Variable universal life insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Money Financial markets Anarchism and capitalism Labor theory of value Universal Studios Principal-agent problem Gross domestic product Illegal drug trade FairTax Dividend Taxation in the United States Foreign exchange market Business Free trade Option Bank fraud Corporate finance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Nuclear power Day trading Economic rent Contract Commodity Predatory lending Internet fraud Social Security debate (United States) Property tax Real estate economics Real estate bubble Property (ownership right) Bretton Woods system Monopoly (game) Productive and unproductive labour Outsourcing Stock market Financial services Concurrent estate Advance fee fraud Sears Holdings Corporation Patent Credit derivative

recover lost rent from tenant that ran off i had this terrible tenant in my house i trusted her but things went sour about years in and she stopped paying my rent on time she came up with feeble excuses i had to take her to court but the process took months just before the bailiffs were going to remove her she left i don't know where she has gone she has trashed the place up she owes grand of rent i don't have her security deposit because she came up with some sob story about her daughter being abused and how she needed money franly i feel very ripped off and want some sort of retribution she was on housing benefits any ideas i had a tenant head off the texas once miles away this was according to the neighbors but they were reliable rather than be mad about it i had a little party that night yeah he trashed the place too and it took alot of money to get him out but at least with him gone i could fix the palce up and move on not trying to sugarcoat your experience just saying that if you are going to be a landlord this is going to happen to you pretty often in answer to your question if you can find out where the person is and they are relatively near you then you can take them to court for the money owed and damages still you may get a judgement that hurts their credit but not much chance you will get any money out of this since they seem to have no money if you can't get an address just forget about suing them and move on note that you clearly did several things wrong why did it take you months it should've taken alot less i suspect either you didn't get a proper lease or you waited on evicting them or something anyhow in the future do everything by the book and evict them immediately also you gave them their deposit back never never do this unless the person is out of the place i've actually paid someone and given them their deposit to leave talk about annoying but it was alot cheaper than an eviction was going to be and i didn't give them anything until they were completely out of the place look you got ripped off but your not the first one there doesn't seem to be much you can do about it expect learn from your mistakes and move on best luck  Leasehold estate EastEnders Estoppel Eviction Rental agreement Big Brother (USA TV series) Plame affair Rent (musical) Social rule Leasing CPU cache 2000 Australian Grand Prix Poker jargon Maison Ikkoku Babylonian law Pitaten The Star Wars Holiday Special Theory of conduct Mortgage Monopoly (game) Little Britain Homer Simpson The Young Ones (TV series) Karl Rove She Loves You Irish Land Act Ashton-Tate Piccolo Junior Saga Concurrent estate Renting Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Milton H.

do apartment complexes have to hire licensed contractors to repair ac units recently our apartment's ac unit went dead the complex sent out a repair man who said the unit needed a new compresseor he installed it and it broke again now the repair man and complex said we broke it on purpose so they put in a new compressor and locked the ac then the ac broke again long story short the repair man is installing the th compressor tomorrow saying we broke all the others our apartment complex says they're billing us for the compressors each i asked the repair man for his license and he freaked out and the apartment complex says it's none of our business to know his license so clearly he doesn't have one i know the repair man can get in trouble but can the apartment complex get in trouble too unfortunately an apartment can use any one they want to fix their property including doing it themselves the fact that they are trying to blame you for a compressor failure is ridiculous but you might end up in court over this so hire your own licensed contractor to examine the unit and give you his opinion as to whats happening if you end up in court over it his opinion is going weigh much more with the judge than a simple handymans word if your man can pinpoint the fault that is causing the problem it could save you the and you can then damand that the apartment owner reimburse your fees for the licensed contractor either way you are covered it sound like the way to go to me better than being stuck with the big bill good luck  Heinkel He 100 Jet engine Public domain Intellectual property Extreme Programming Teen Girl Squad Software engineering Space Shuttle program Maison Ikkoku GNU General Public License OpenDocument Trademark Patent 613 mitzvot Insurance Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans Keynesian economics Humphrey Bogart Canon (fiction) 2000 Australian Grand Prix 24 Hours of Le Mans Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Theory of conduct Pebble bed reactor Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Roswell UFO incident Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bob and George Pinball Blenheim Palace Year 2000 problem Oh My Goddess!

why do real estate agents make so much to the selling agent and the buyers agent seems like a lot especially when houses are k in a lot of places what exactly do they do that i couldn't do myself seriously real estate agents actually do not make that much unless they are top producers the average real estate agent grosses about year the reason i say they do not actually make that much is you have to account for their expenses brokerage fees etc for example on a home offering commission the breakdown would be as follows total commission to list agent to selling agent agent breakdown subtract franchise fee broker split gross agent commission now subtract taxes licensing fees marketing fees expenses such as car gas etc and the agent is not left with much for their valuable services offered such as preparing proper legal documents negotiating the contract cordinating inspections title work financing not to mention advertising marketing and showing the home i hope this helps you understand that agents do offer valuable services at lower rate than you'd expect southeast mi realtor  Real estate broker Mutual fund Mortgage Gross domestic product Tax Microeconomics Taxation in the United States Contract Stock Advance fee fraud Publishing Mergers and acquisitions Cable television Measures of national income and output Predatory lending Day trading Annuity Short selling Agency (law) GNU General Public License Life insurance Multiple Listing Service Financial services Citigroup Supply and demand Primerica Financial Services Government National Mortgage Association Sport utility vehicle Lloyd's of London Wal-Mart Salary cap Eliot Spitzer Leasing Property tax Investment bank Social Security debate (United States) Productive and unproductive labour Concurrent estate United Kingdom corporation tax Bank Security (finance) Value added tax Real estate Stock market Capital accumulation Wells Fargo Warren Buffett Capitalism Mobile home FairTax Credit card Reaganomics Inheritance tax Mediation Privatization Oakland Athletics Monetary policy Inflation NFL on television Free trade Real estate economics Housing cooperative Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Airline Service National Kidney Foundation Singapore Title insurance Business-to-consumer electronic commerce RKO Pictures Option Price discrimination PE ratio ITV Television in the United States Acorn Computers Estate agent (United Kingdom) Futures contract Student loan Arbitrage Emissions trading Donald Trump Conveyancing Trust (Law) USA Finance Real estate bubble Franchising Business Internet fraud Hedge fund Licence to Kill Filling station Nuclear power 2004-05 NHL lockout Economy of Pakistan Sears Holdings Corporation

real estate offer would you sign we are in an area that is going through rezoning from rural to industrial we have been approached with an offer that is what we are happy with money wise the catch is that the potential buyer wants to wait until offical rezoning has been granted before exchanging contracts and then normal day settlement the issue at the moment is that rezoning could take up to years maybe more maybe less if we agree to this we are effectively tying up our place to this buyer for this period if someone comes along in the meantime no guarantees of this happening we can't sell to them but when rezoning comes through we have sold immediately if we sign the offer on the table at the moment would you agree to this we are agonising over which way to go sign and have a firm buyer or hope someone else comes along and buys without the rezoning such a dilemma and huge decision other option is to do nothing and just wait for rezoning if it doesn't happen then they don't buy anyway we love where we live and are not desparate to sell the potential buyer has agreed to a of the purchase price as an option fee non refundable but this will also come off the purchase price at the end it is not in addition to the purchase price that is a tricky situation as far as i see it is the contract you are asked to sign contigent on the rezoning if the rezoning is not happening for some stupid reason you don't have a contract now the contract says that the day settlement are going to start after the official rezoning is done if that is the case and rezoning will take years then plus the days for settlement that is a long time and nobody knows what the market is doing you grant the seller a price which seems to be a good price in today's market but after rezoning and real estate market recovering this today good price might not be to good for you anymore you could try to a counter the offer and put a clause in there that you can keep the house on the market should you get another offer in inform your first buyer and grant him the right to close on your property in days to the original agreed price b counter the offer and leave the price open as soon as the rezoning is done get an appraisal for the new value of your property the purchase price will be either the original price he offered you today or the appraised value whatever is higher  Supply and demand Real estate broker Microeconomics Option Contract Mortgage Call option Futures contract Put option Islamic banking Short selling Life insurance Security (finance) Price discrimination Tax Warranty Insurance Economics Stock Annuity Auction Standard form contract Stock market Mutual fund Arbitrage Commodity markets Rational pricing Topps MMORPG Privatization Poker jargon Option style Intellectual property Conveyancing Unconscionability Margin (finance) Zoning Monetary policy Royal Assent Technical analysis Gold as an investment Deflation (economics) GNU General Public License UK Singles Chart Gross domestic product Mergers and acquisitions Real estate Enron Corporation Derivative (finance) Commodity Wal-Mart Gold standard Housing cooperative First-sale doctrine Predatory lending IBM PC compatible Trading Places Day trading Estoppel Bretton Woods system Williamsburg, Brooklyn Real estate appraisal Hyperinflation Externality Insider trading Babylonian law Bond Inflation Credit derivative Advertising Toyota Prius Article One of the United States Constitution American Broadcasting Company Free market Real estate economics Labour economics Oakland Athletics Free trade Monopsony Plame affair Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Inventory Trade Surplus value Law of value Equal Protection Clause Asian financial crisis Hire purchase Divorce B__rgerliches Gesetzbuch

foreclosure question lock on the door question for you if there is a house that is currently listed in the county website as a foreclosure within the last month and there is about a foot long lock around the door knob at the house is that house still able to be sold there is currently a realty sign outside the house but i am not sure if this large lock is put on by the realtor or by the mortgage company my husbands ex owns the home and we are just trying to get information on it for the kids sake btw they moved out of the house about or months ago and put everything in storage help anyone know for sure what kind of lock they use on a foreclosure vs realtor thanks and when i say on the county website i mean in the court pages where documents have been served the long lock you are trying to describe is considered a lockbox in real estate terms if there is a real estate sign outside the house then it is available to buy just because it is in foreclosure does not mean that the bank is wanting to take it into their inventory the lender has enough homes i'm sure and they really don't want the house just the money owed to them the lender is asking the real estate company to sell the house and get the best offer they can the person who is going through the foreclosure will still owe the difference between the loan and what the house actually sells for the persons credit will be affected as well  Real estate broker Bond Foreclosure Insurance Predatory lending Government National Mortgage Association Finance Concurrent estate Debt Donald Trump Bank Great Depression Joseph P.

viewing a house for lease i have a couple coming tomorrow to view my house which is up for lease anyone got any tips on how to do this also any tips on how to make them love my house and want to lease it you aren't likely going to be able to make them love your house over another unless it is decorated nicely and pristine clean but what you can do is talk up the neighborhood and the nearby amenities the location offers you could also reassure your prospective tenants that you are an interested landlord in the sense that you will be very prompt to overcome any maintenance issue through the course of the lease i think this advice is more valuable than links to a useless blog  Leasing Leasehold estate Rental agreement Joseph Chamberlain Blog The Inside Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Plame affair Housing cooperative Irish Land Act Waste (law) Vista Way Estoppel Apartment Education in England Oakland Athletics Intellectual property Property (ownership right) Reservoir Dogs Bud Adams Section 8 (housing) Marriage The Lovely Bones Babylonian law Public housing Miss Saigon Laura Schlessinger Violin The Commons Blackground Records New Deal World Trade Center Boise, Idaho Battery electric vehicle Google The Dalek Invasion of Earth Land tenure Procrastination The Graduate Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 2 NorthBridge Apartment Complex Intermediate consumption National Lampoon's Animal House Stakeholder Eviction Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory Richard Cobden Commodore 64 Avenue Q Chatham Square Ossining (village), New York Israeli settlement Air America Radio Epcot Canadian Pacific Railway Chatsworth House Pride and Prejudice Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Islamic Golden Age Crime prevention through environmental design Molecular nanotechnology Theory of conduct Capitalism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Upholstery Collyer brothers University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Japanese law Canadian Senate Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Australian constitutional crisis of 1975 Walt Disney World Resort Strap-on dildo Stewart International Airport Sharon Tate Stuyvesant Town Ralph Nader Grand Forks, North Dakota Goodness and value theory Lewistown, Pennsylvania Bush Supreme Court candidates Internet troll Portland, Oregon Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Infidels Wolverine (comics) Red Hill, Australian Capital Territory Manorialism Phoebe Halliwell Toronto The Young Ones (TV series) Property law Rent control Wall Street (movie) Kwajalein Juliana of the Netherlands History of Malaysia John Kerr Asterix and the Laurel Wreath

when rehabbing a house do you go the most minimal ie steel back door no screen door or wuld you at least putr a screen door up it is a residential neiborhood alll house similiar and all have screen doors just curious as to what majority prefer it all depends on if you are staying there yourself to live or plan on selling it sometime in the near future you must always keep in mind what fits the house and what fits the neighborhood if you have a very expensive door and a cheaper frame it sticks out and you rarely get your moneys worth but for the money a nicer solid core door is better money spent than the screen door go with something nice looking in the range of what is on display in the neighborhood you can go higher in the range but don't go way outside of what fits  Digital photography Microeconomics Urban sprawl Sugar Land, Texas Minor league baseball Transformer Solar cell Inflation Light-emitting diode Brewery De Lorean DMC-12 Violin Station wagon Laserdisc Illegal drug trade Back to the Future Window Codename: Kids Next Door Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Nissan Skyline Drug test Mattress Radio masts and towers Nintendo GameCube KCR Avenue Q Double bass Salt Lake City, Utah Mortgage Tax Ford Model T Japanese toilet Coaxial cable Mutual fund Textile manufacturing Tea Bicycle ATI Technologies Nuclear power Space Shuttle program PlayStation Portable Meat Loaf Publicly funded medicine Rent (musical) Day trading Personal rapid transit PE ratio You Don't Know Jack Castle of the Winds Timpani Casting Mario Hydrogen economy Fahrenheit 9/11 Monopoly (game) College Magnet On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Oldsmobile Silhouette Ed, Edd n Eddy The O.C.

is this a good ad would you buy this house realtors did nothing for me so i am trying to sell comps are selling for k and both smaller houses i am very motivated to sell hr commute to work daily double yuck but i am not desperate i can pay the mortgage and commute if i have to this is the ad i placed in owners com owner financed or buy outright in move in condition recently painted centrally located cape cod with and bathrooms sq feet finished space level fenced x lot vinyl siding laundry room on st floor hardwood berber and vinyl tile floors large walk in closets coats closet attached garage with electricity and water additional off street parking drive shed landscaped patio covered porch ceiling fans window treatments satellite dish stove refrigerator washer dryer and newer furnace vestal hills elementary area financing details in ad are below not enough room here is this a good ad would you buy this house these are the financing details owner will finance purchase if it is easier to borrow a deposit than a full mortgage during credit repairs but owner financing entails risks not taken with an outright sale therefore owner financing will require the following asking price a one or two year lease buyer's choice an option to buy contract a non refundable deposit to be credited towards total at closing mth lease payments with of that held in escrow towards total at closing three references and income verification only leasing to offer buyers a finance option not renting without option to buy contract call or e mail for directions and appointment to see the house house would be a good starter home or a sweet deal for an investor if i had the cash i'd put a pool in the yard or ad a rd room and sell for an extra k so house is in mint condition sarah sorry to dissappoint you but i have hired and fired realtors the first one advised me to replace the furnace and tack that to the price which i did and now i am going to have to eat since the house will not sell for that much more she also brought me zero buyers in months no open houses no anything except a sign in my yard and an mls listing the second brought me buyers that were not pre approved because they were not listed with another realtor and she could be a dual agent to earn the full commission instead of the measly and when that did not work she tried getting me to lower the price to the maximum one of her buyers could qualify for which would have left me a k debt on the mortgage i now owe what a sweet deal don't help me anymore please i didn't see your list price in your ad but asking for rent even if it is a part of a lease option seems excessive for a k house the deposit money is a little high too but i think you could get away with requiring k and still be competitive you might want to compare your rental rate to others in your neighborhood too i think the description in the ad sounds good still you need to remember that an ad is not meant to close the sale but merely to get people in the door to take it in consideration for purchase so to answer your question no i wouldn't buy the house but if it was in my price range and i was pre approved i would come and take a look at it if i wasn't pre approved i wouldn't even bother because the lease option rent is too much  Insurance Islamic banking Futures contract Security (finance) Derivative (finance) Bond Microeconomics Kitchen Oakland Athletics Credit card Life insurance Debt McMansion Stock Capitalism Poker jargon Leasing Tax Annuity Monetary policy Option Taxation in the United States Arbitrage Babylonian law Price discrimination Bank Hire purchase Housing cooperative Mutual fund FairTax United Kingdom corporation tax Margin (finance) Economics Los Angeles Clippers Ford Motor Company Rental agreement Economy of Russia Privatization Short selling Mortgage-backed security Mergers and acquisitions Finance Citigroup American Broadcasting Company Capital accumulation Money Government National Mortgage Association Internet fraud Financial markets Hybrid vehicle Contract Hyperinflation Supply and demand Toyota Prius Deflation (economics) U.S. public debt Great Depression Boston and Lowell Railroad PE ratio Interest Property tax Prostitution in Germany Inventory Wal-Mart Investment bank Beverly Hills, California Bretton Woods system UK Singles Chart Corporate finance Gold standard Basement Airline Sento Chatsworth House Monopoly (game) Stairway Inflation Fire fighting De Lorean DMC-12 Intellectual property Wayne Corporation Betting (poker) Warranty Rational pricing Bus models used in New York City Transit Dodge Charger Surplus value Atari 8-bit family Advance fee fraud Surveillance Sport utility vehicle

can the government help ease the interest rate rises on home loans if so what when will this happen its hard enough to afford the simple life e g food bills car registration but with the constant rises in interest rates on home loans it makes it even harder for the average home loan and even harder on someone wanting to get a home loan the over riding governance on interest rates is the federal reserve system however the sharp increase in real estate values over the past years makes no sense to me your average home was once an affordable expense when it was worth only a hundred thousand dollars in this market we see ridiculously priced homes everything from studio apartments to small mansions all priced way above the means of ordinary people who comprise the bulk of the population what is taking effect now is that as the people keep losing good paying jobs to downsizing they in turn move in to cramped living quarters this in turn results in a glut of real estate sitting with for sale signs that could stay for sale for a long time unless prices get reduced to where people can actually afford them the shaky condition of the real estate market could lead to further economic trouble the stimulus that the federal reserve can provide by lowering interest rates will ease the burden but never enough to give the general population the needed relief for these astoundingly high real estate costs in effect we have a shaky economy hinging upon what real estate will do some prosper by buying and selling never considering that people's income should dictate what real estate should sell for no slight decrease in interest rates will solve this growing problem only drastic reductions in the costs for real estate can revive the interest in buying real estate again those willing to sell property should consider lowering them to where a greater pool of potential buyers will buy without having future problems as interest rates change the greed factor will ultimately turn the american dream into a nightmare don't depend on what the government can do their hands are tied now that they have a run away national debt and bad fiscal policy  Capital accumulation Monetary policy Keynesian economics Supply and demand Economy of Russia History of the United States (1918-1945) Tax Gold standard Mortgage Hyperinflation Bretton Woods system Tariff Surplus value FairTax Insurance Economy of the United States Life insurance Supply-side economics Great Depression Taxation in the United States Reaganomics Economy of Africa Economy of Pakistan Unemployment Economy of Sri Lanka Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) U.S. public debt Money Bond Privatization Euro Law of value Progressive tax Asian financial crisis 1973 oil crisis Government debt Tax cut Marshall Plan Mutual fund Arbitrage Debt Economy of Nigeria Arthur Laffer United States dollar Monetarism Gross domestic product History of post-Soviet Russia Real estate bubble Deficit spending Predatory lending Labor theory of value Free trade Trickle down effect Famine Donald Trump Economy of Chile Social Security debate (United States) Minimum wage Short selling Kyoto Protocol Canadian and American economies compared Oil depletion Publicly funded medicine Biodiesel Health insurance Canadian and American health care systems compared Federal Reserve Implications of peak oil Digital photography Annuity Property tax Economics Globalization Subsidy Economy of El Salvador Economy of Haiti Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Intellectual property Wal-Mart Economic history of the United States Illegal drug trade MMORPG Argentine Currency Board Mergers and acquisitions

is there a limit to how much you can withdrawl from you k for the down payment on your first home i know it is under the hardship clause and fidelity knuckleads told me k per person but i cannot find any confirmation of this limit pls advise fidelity are a bunch of knuckleheads who've somehow conned most major businesses into putting their k business with them in return they have to toe the line anyways there is no k limit for hardship withdrawal as long as you are meeting the criteria for hardship distribution and you are i e purchase of primary residence then there should be no problem normally a hardship distribution can only be for the dollar amount of the financial hardship there is essentially no limit except the funds that you have in your account that are available to you with the home purchase your hardship amount is generally your down payment and or closing costs so you should be able to request an amount that would cover these costs obviously you will have to show proof though which would be a mortgage application or seller's agreement that shows the costs that you are having to pay out of pocket i e can't be included in the mortgage note the only way there might be a k limit is if it is some sort of plan imposed limit this means that your company might have drafted their plan to limit the hardship withdrawals get a copy of the summary plan description and read what it says about hardship withdrawals  401(k) Mortgage Life insurance FairTax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus United Kingdom corporation tax Bank Security (finance) Islamic banking Annuity Bond Taxation in the United States Bretton Woods system Social Security (United States) Student loan SCO-Linux controversies Health insurance Microeconomics Legal tender Trademark Credit card fraud Money Credit card Wal-Mart Mensal__o scandal Primerica Financial Services Social Security debate (United States) Personal finance Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Gold standard Dividend Real estate broker Unemployment Construction Capitalism Housing cooperative Short selling United States Postal Service Cooperative Kyoto Protocol Bank of China (Hong Kong) Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Deflation (economics) Oil-for-Food Programme Corporate finance Open access Pension Gross domestic product Monetary policy Food Stamp Program Schabir Shaik Trial GNU General Public License Derivative (finance) Rational Unified Process Federal National Mortgage Association Savings and loan association Corporation History of the United States (1918-1945) Income trust Copyright law of the United Kingdom Bank fraud International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict Screenplay Octopus card Public good Canada Health Act Warren Buffett Futures contract Value added tax Public domain International Monetary Fund Leasing Hyperinflation Great Depression Education in the People's Republic of China Citigroup Health savings account Probation officer Air New Zealand Trade union Software patent debate Annual percentage rate Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Business continuity planning Economy of Russia Privatization Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Monopoly (game) Patent application Mergers and acquisitions Medicare (United States) Identity theft

has anyone used upack com to move i'm in the process of moving and have been pricing out different companies i have found a great price with upack com and want to know if anyone has had any bad experiences with them i used them in february to move from ca to wa i found them on the internet and their prices were less than all of the other quotes i received i had heard about a lot of shady moving companies before so i checked them out on epinions com and the better business bureau before i decided to use them and their feedback was good i had nothing that arrived damaged but i have heard that you should pack your belongings very tightly and securely in the trailer because otherwise some things may get broken the trickiest part is deciding how much space you need in the trailer the estimate that they provided turned out to be accurate for me everything was clearly spelled out in their contract and they took their space measurements with me so there was no confusion i had a great experience with them and would recommend them i even had to reschedule my pick up date at the last minute and they were very accommodating and friendly also i chose to pack at the terminal and pick up from the terminal instead of having the trailer dropped of at my apartment to load and unload it turned out to be cheaper for me that way including the cost of renting a uhaul truck to take my things to and from the terminal you can choose to pay extra for them to guarantee your delivery date but i chose not to my belongings took one day longer to arrive than they originally estimated but there was a snowstorm so that legitimately slowed them down you can also track the location of your belongings while they are en route i hope this helps you out good luck with your move  Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) Shipping Insurance Boston and Lowell Railroad Airport E-mail spam Extreme Programming Semi-trailer Economy of the United States Modem Battle of the Bulge Microeconomics Final Fantasy XI Airbus A380 Mutual fund USS Tunny (SS-282) Auto Train (Amtrak) Hubble Space Telescope Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Battles of Lexington and Concord Norwegian Campaign Health insurance CPU cache IBM PC compatible Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Weezer Fast bowling Short selling Deflation (economics) Space Shuttle program E85 Surveillance Electricity meter USS Waters (DD-115) BC Rail Bulk vending Protoss System/34 Corporate governance United Parcel Service Mobile home Solar cell System/36 Social rule Rail transport in Ireland USS Wahoo (SS-238) Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Upholstery Poker jargon Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Hash table USS Whale (SS-239) Contract Internal ballistics Avalanche Mouse (computing) Annuity GSM services Economics Bond Surplus value Internet fraud Capital accumulation TransUnion Online music store 1957 World Series Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Rail terminology Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 2000 Australian Grand Prix Natural Selection (computer game) Windows XP Norway national football team Acorn Computers PlayStation 3 Gross domestic product Windows Server 2003 USS Wickes (DD-578) Fable (video game) Rational Unified Process Philip J.

can anyone share information on reverse mortgages my in laws have one i think it varies by state but the basic concept is pretty simple a lender is lending them a little bit more each month direct deposited to their account so as time goes by they owe more and more money on their house it's reverse because a regular mortgage gets paid off month by month and eventually you have it all paid for the amount of money they can receive each month is determined by law using an actuarial calculation so it is the same for any person of same age gender etc you do not ever have to pay the money back until either the property is sold or they die so if they live a long time they can receive quite a bit of money month after month in general these can be a good solution for the elderly person who wants to stay in their house but cannot afford it on a fixed income especially if the area where they live has increasing property values so they still have equity in the house even though they owe on the mortgage any lender can provide info i think they all offer the same monthly amount though interest rates can vary as usual lower is better the older the person is the more money they receive per month becauase their life expectancy is less  Mortgage Bond Life insurance Insurance Annuity Tax Finance Personal finance Taxation in the United States Annual percentage rate Predatory lending Student loan Debt Bank Government National Mortgage Association FairTax Credit card Microeconomics Federal National Mortgage Association Money Property tax Deflation (economics) Derivative (finance) Financial markets Inflation Monetary policy Concurrent estate Short selling Allodial title Economy of Russia PE ratio Actuarial notation Labor theory of value Yield curve Pension Interest rate Capitalism Title insurance Social Security (United States) Government debt Supply and demand Temasek Holdings Mutual fund Capital accumulation Central bank Leasing United Kingdom corporation tax Housing cooperative Corporation Primerica Financial Services Trust (Law) USA Gross domestic product Intellectual property Law of value Savings and loan association Estoppel Progressive tax Flat tax Money supply Surplus value Fixed income MMORPG Real estate broker Foreclosure Islamic economics Public policy Construction 401(k) Price discrimination Unemployment benefit Bankruptcy in the United States Supply-side economics Debt levels and flows Unconscionability Usury Rational pricing U.S. public debt Economic inequality Contract Central processing unit Monopoly (game) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Keynesian economics Economics Investment bank Corporate finance

real estate career any suggestions on how to become a successful realtor actually the first person was correct and the second response was incorrect you need to be sociable have a great personality a problem solver and have integrity what worked for me was reading a lot of real estate investing books and material it made me think outside of the box gave me great marketing and negotiating ideas and tactics it also gave me knowledge about foreclosures and how they work so when the second response says she is not making money in a downward market i just walk in and take her clients because i know how to do short sales the best part of real estate is that you make money by helping other people focus on this aspect and you cannot fail oh yeah grow a thick skin you'll need it regards  Real estate broker Deflation (economics) Great Depression Keynesian economics Investment bank Real estate Microcredit Joseph P.

do you think the mortgage market will correct its self soon or get worse before it gets better it will get worse before it gets better there has just been too much rope given to the subprime market which never should have been given in the first place so now all the nervous financiers are pulling that rope back in fast continuing to upend the housing and mortgage market think of it as a self perpetuating cycle when the market starts pulling its support no one is willing to pump any more money into that part of the market when this happens demand goes down and prices of the esoteric products created in the mortgage market go down as well we already see that most subprime borrowers cannot meet their monthly payments anymore and with the market jittery there is little to no chance of banks being forgiving and holding off on forcing forclosures of course this pumps more unwanted homes into the market increasing supply as demand continues to drop due to tightening credit requirements and higher interest rates so no the market won't likely correct itself soon  Mortgage Deflation (economics) Bond Monetary policy Bank Debt Predatory lending Federal National Mortgage Association Keynesian economics Money supply Mortgage-backed security Economy of Russia Inflation Real estate bubble Interest Money Insurance Asian financial crisis Government National Mortgage Association Gold standard Monetarism Hyperinflation Economy of India FairTax Financial markets Supply-side economics Great Depression Capital accumulation Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Savings and loan association Derivative (finance) Central bank Life insurance Annuity Interest rate Business cycle Financial capital Student loan Fiat money Say's law Primerica Financial Services Economy of the United States Credit card Exchange rate Finance ACORN Yield curve Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Islamic banking Reaganomics Personal finance Free trade Taxation in the United States Futures contract Privatization History of post-Soviet Russia Microeconomics Security (finance) Unemployment Economy of Romania Renewable energy development Monopoly (game) Economic history of the United States Economy of Pakistan History of the United States (1865-1918) Labor theory of value Law of value Arbitrage Labour economics Citigroup Black market Short selling Euro Money market Monopoly Supply and demand Airline Corporate finance Technical analysis Securitization Mutual fund Operation Market Garden American individualist anarchism Real estate economics British property bubble Social Credit Siphon Irish Life and Permanent Deficit spending Hydrogen economy Stock market Social Security (United States) Kyoto Protocol

what is the best method for synchronizing the sale of an existing home with the purchase of another i am soon to be married and currently own a home however we would like to by a new home that's ours my philosophy is to wait until mine sells or at least have some people who are seriously interested in mine before making an offer on the new one my fiance already has a home picked out that she likes and would like to go ahead and make an offer before someone else buys it out from under us but since it's a buyer's market i am afraid that we could end up with two mortgages if we do this please wait until your house sells if you buy a new home then list yours it could take another months to sell meanwhile you will have mortgage payments you don't want to start off your marriage being over your heads with bills i'm in the real estate business and i've seen too many people get into real financial crisis' for buying before they sell there will be another house that your fiance likes when the time it right there are a ton of houses out there  Mortgage Real estate broker Government National Mortgage Association Security (finance) Federal National Mortgage Association Donald Trump Housing cooperative Islamic banking Insurance Deflation (economics) Real estate Bond Real estate bubble FairTax Treasury security Toronto-Dominion Bank Microeconomics Mortgage-backed security Internet fraud Gross domestic product Life insurance Primerica Financial Services Mergers and acquisitions Personal finance Irish Property Bubble Supply and demand Money Concurrent estate PE ratio Option Wells Fargo Savings and loan association Financial markets Bank Futures contract Derivative (finance) Oakland Athletics Leasing Pyramid scheme Municipal bond Finance Unconscionability Tesco Stock Predatory lending Personal property Price discrimination Annuity Berkshire Hathaway Arbitrage Stock market Debt Sears Catalog Home Toyota Prius History of the United States (1918-1945) Amway Publishing Marketing Auction Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Taxation in the United States MMORPG Wal-Mart Sears Holdings Corporation Stamp duty Great Depression Monopoly (game) Health insurance Insider trading Warren Buffett Ashton-Tate Commodore International British residential property market Babylonian law Tax Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Citigroup Emerson College Gold standard Speculation Surplus value Real estate developer Electronic commerce Monetary policy Bill Gates Inventory National Australia Bank Foreign exchange market Paul Martin Business Los Angeles Clippers Privatization Investment bank Leeds United F.C.

what would happen if my landlord wont let me break my lease unless i pay months rent she wouldnt give me a good reference until i wrote on a piece of paper i am putting in my day notice and agree to pay blah blah well she already gave me my good reference so what will happen if i dont pay the money will that piece of paper hold up in court do you think she'll even take me to court what happens if she does take me to court i really cant afford to pay this what should i do i think it might dpend on where you live where i live alberta canada a tenant can break their lease and i can only charge them the amount of money i would lose by them leaving since we live in an area that has renters lined up begging for places the only thing i can charge my outgoing tenants is my hard expenses for example advertisement costs but not the cost of my time in interviewing new tenants if i was unable to re rent my place or could not rent it at the same rate listed in the previous lease my outgoing tenant would owe me any money that i was losing the moral of the story contact your local tenants rights board they deal with this stuff all the time the rules in different areas are different nobyd really wants to go to court so try to find something that can work for both of you ie finding a new tenant for them on your own time  Leasehold estate Rental agreement Leasing Estoppel Eviction Concurrent estate Monopoly (game) Renting American individualist anarchism Babylonian law The New School at West Heath Microeconomics Student loan Taxation in the United States Housing cooperative Insurance Boston and Lowell Railroad Credit card Barrister Public housing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Property tax Manorialism Capitalism United States Postal Service Anarchism and capitalism Irish Land Act Serfdom Islamic banking Appeal Rent control Tariff Hyperinflation New Deal Corporation Poker jargon Apartment Property (ownership right) Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Education in England Japanese law Mortgage Surplus value 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Judiciary of Hong Kong Waste (law) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Land tenure First-sale doctrine Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Gross domestic product Real estate economics Annuity Thomas de Littleton Squatting French nobility Derivative (finance) Inflation Apartment building Life insurance Iggy Pop Schabir Shaik Trial Property law Ponzi scheme BC Rail Art Modell Rosa Parks Prostitution in Germany Rick Santorum Allodial title SCO-Linux controversies Tithe Bond Tax Gentrification Intermediate consumption Maison Ikkoku Public domain E-mail spam Politics of Canada Miss Saigon Economics Baccarat Intellectual property Plantations of Ireland Canadian and American health care systems compared Unreformed House of Commons Progressive tax Parasite singles Blockbuster Video Jennifer Lopez Labor theory of value Call centre CPU cache Income trust Section 8 (housing) Virgin Mobile

after reading my whole question can someone tell me the pros of renting out our home i know the cons how do i know what to rent it out for also my mortgage went up because i thought we'd move out by years so now that we're a little behind i decided not to refi since i thought we'd be selling however its a tough market so we may have to rent it out should i refi to get the mortgage payments lower before i rent it since the mortgage is definitely high for our home i need advice and ideas of how to maybe rent but make a little money too anyone rent out there and how do you work it and figure out what to make the rent amount do you think based on the national average of yrs the location of the property and shape that it's in that it will double in value if so may i suggest something a little outside the box refi into interest only no pre pay penalty payments try to get half back in rent if you get more bonus the rest of the balance you should be able to get back from your tax return from writing off the mortgage and depreciation if you can create at minimum breaking even until the property value doubles then you can refi and pull of the equity out if it is worth now you would be able to pull out of tax free money the only real risk is if you think that the property will not appreciate very well but if you are breaking even then there's no real loss anyway rental property can be a great investment but don't get too caught up in trying to get the rent payments to match the mortgage payments it usually doesn't happen unless you have paid down more than half of it already and don't forget about your deductions good luck  Life insurance Insurance Monopoly (game) Taxation in the United States Leasing Microeconomics Annuity Deflation (economics) Debt Mutual fund Bond Government National Mortgage Association Estoppel Islamic banking Money Gross domestic product Real estate bubble United Kingdom corporation tax Economic rent Property tax 401(k) Mortgage-backed security Operating surplus FairTax Keynesian economics Capital accumulation Renting Donald Trump Profit Interest Progressive tax Leasehold estate Intellectual property British residential property market Federal National Mortgage Association Warren Buffett Flat tax Value added Poker jargon Inflation Economy of the United States Security (finance) Income trust Cost of capital Collateralized mortgage obligation Student loan Economy of Russia Allodial title Concurrent estate Investment bank Reaganomics Personal finance Derivative (finance) Predatory lending Capitalism Social Security debate (United States) Free trade Tax Reform Act of 1986 Bretton Woods system Salary cap Municipal bond Mobile home Income statement American individualist anarchism Arthur Laffer Real estate developer Babylonian law Bank Measures of national income and output Minimum wage Primerica Financial Services Monetary policy $ale of the Century Gold standard Rent (musical) Avenue Q Squatting You Don't Know Jack Harlem Geolibertarianism Government debt Corporate finance Consumption of fixed capital U.S. public debt Knots Landing Public good Subsidy Productive and unproductive labour Economy of India

can someone seal off a fire door i need legal advice i have a retail store that has an apartment above it the entrance to this apartment is from a stairway that is a storefront down the owners of that building have apartments the stairs lead too plus my apartment somewhere in the history of the building an entrance was made to my apartment through a fire door between the buildings the previous owner of my building had lifetime rights to live rent free in my apartment he since died i am renting this apartment to my son now the owners of the store with the stairway say they don't want me to use their stairs i told them that there is no other entrance possilbe for this apartment but i would really try to think of a solution they agreed my son told me that they knocked on his door this morning and asked if we were making a new entrance it really is impossilbe because they were going to seal the fired door up i doubt that sealing a fire door and the only entrance and escape to our apartment is legal is it this is the only access to this apartment it was written into the abstract itself for the gentleman to have lifelong rights to live in our apartment rent free there may have been another entrance at one time but it has been this way for as long as any of the owners renters remember one person said that about years ago it was a two story furniture store then the owner made an apartment above and the only access was throught this fire door it even has the apartment number on the door and a hallway right to it so it has been this way for at least years we purchased the building with knowledge and being told this was the access it is nothing new to the stairway owners quick like a bunny pick up the phone and call the fire dept not the admin tell them what is happening i can guarantee you if these people seal that door they will recieve a large fine as well as probably get taken to court and they will have to incur the cost of putting it back to the way it was the fire dept and the building depts have determined that there must be a fire door there if there was not there would be a loss of life get on this quick good luck  Sin City Columbine High School massacre Lawrence v.

what is the difference between pmi and an loan this ties back to my previous question my friends are being told their monthly payments will be around for a k house using a interest rate on a yr fixed seems impossible to me when comparing to amortization tables i come up with mo some of the answers told me the explanation could be pmi which i know means private mortgage insurance but not much other than that for my house i have a loan since i put no downpayment and my rate is about a month but my house was k i don't understand how they could pay only less than me for a house that costs so cheaper so please explain this pmi and why they just cant get an loan yes i have two loans one for at and one for at i had for a downpayment but decided to keep that cash for other purposes once i realized i could get two loans instead also this is definitely for a yr fixed not a or loan second my tax rate in my county is slightly higher than theirs okay first of all the pmi is insurance that protects the lender from you walking away whether or not this is required is based on the loan to value ratio the more of the home's value you borrow the more likely the bank is to get hurt if you bail so they usually want pmi if you go over that's why the loans were devised one thing you have to consider on an is that the loan is usually at a higher rate like up to a full percentage and they usually have a balloon meaning you pay as if it were a thirty year loan but it's all due in fifteen that scares some people now there are a lot of other factors that can make the difference in payments besides pmi and loan value taxes may be different and so might insurance there's also the term of the loan and the interest rate why can't they get an well could be credit scores could be the appraised value of the house could be that they don't want two payments maybe the balloon scared them off maybe the interest rates were so much higher remember also that pmi isn't a permanent part of the payment after a year or two if they've paid diligently and the appraised value is high enough above the loan they will stop charging pmi on request of course so the homeowner has to do something about it  Insurance Bond Life insurance Annuity Predatory lending Annual percentage rate Real estate bubble Debt Bank Deflation (economics) Microeconomics Interest Credit card Savings and loan association Economy of Russia Islamic banking Primerica Financial Services Monetary policy Government National Mortgage Association FairTax Taxation in the United States Gold standard Federal Reserve Mutual fund Government debt Tax Citigroup Economy of India Money Social Security (United States) Mortgage-backed security Health insurance Credit score Subsidy Capital accumulation Personal finance United Kingdom corporation tax Microcredit Publicly funded medicine Federal National Mortgage Association Finance History of the United States (1918-1945) Islamic economics Variable universal life insurance Home insurance Debt consolidation Schabir Shaik Trial Payday loan Mobile home Interest rate Unemployment Hyperinflation Security (finance) Tertiary education fees in Australia Yield curve Title insurance Capitalism Compensation of employees Financial markets Bretton Woods system Tennessee State Constitution National Insurance Surplus value ACORN Paintball Poker jargon Education in the United States Gross domestic product Derivative (finance) Social Security debate (United States) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Mergers and acquisitions PE ratio Real estate broker Collateralized mortgage obligation Euro Economy of Pakistan Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Certificate of deposit Health care in the United States Central bank History of post-Soviet Russia Trust (Law) USA Usury Evan Mecham Leasing Supply-side economics

whats really going on in the mortgage industry can someone please break it down for me what effects will this have on sub prime mortgage companies this is a long complicated answer i am a mortgage broker in the midwest that does prime subprime alt a and government essentially the foreclosure rates for loans that were funded over the previous year boom in the housing industry are astronomical products like negative amortization and interest only put a lot of homeowners in a situation where they couldn't keep up with their payments once they adjusted to a regular amortization schedule and there was no equity in their home to sell it due to the high foreclosure rates investors responded by making significant changes to the qualifications of certain subprime loans for instance the credit score requirements increased dramatically to do no money down loans or stated income loans in order to combat the high risk levels they were dealing in before the foreclosure rates continued to climb and the business stalled because they made it harder for people to get money so lenders became strapped for cash a lot of lenders acted like consumers in that they overextended themselves as well borrowing cheap money on teaser rates that caught up with them investors pulled their money out of lenders in the subprime market and rendered the lenders without the ability to fund any transactions and thus close others faced legal issues and were shut down because of fraud and still others just couldn't keep up with their debts and filed for bankruptcy what this has done in the subprime market is make is hard to get loans done when i normally would have different lenders taking a loan i may now only have or if any at all thus less people can buy houses so the real estate market has suffered as well which effects consumer confidence in the market which effects their spending which makes investors and lenders even more fickle when it comes to these matters there are a lot of contributing factors with the fed raising rates that go beyond this that are affecting the overall mortgage industry but the rates are still very low compared to historic averages  Great Depression Microeconomics Federal National Mortgage Association Financial markets Finance Government National Mortgage Association Economy of the United States Student loan Credit card Life insurance Government debt Mortgage-backed security Annual percentage rate Security (finance) Gold standard Islamic banking Mutual fund Short selling Primerica Financial Services Free trade FairTax Capital accumulation Economy of India Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Taxation in the United States Interest Annuity Citigroup PE ratio Tax Temasek Holdings Stock Derivative (finance) Real estate Keynesian economics Money supply Privatization Microcredit Money Gross domestic product History of the United States (1918-1945) Usury Real estate broker Subsidy Municipal bond Real estate bubble Bretton Woods system Corporation Foreclosure Hyperinflation Central bank Economy of Pakistan Enron Corporation Interest rate Collateralized debt obligation Yield curve Publicly funded medicine Savings and Loan crisis ACORN Federal Reserve Income trust Investment bank Capitalism Personal finance Economic relations of Japan Allodial title Argentine Currency Board Consumer finance 401(k) Business cycle History of post-Soviet Russia U.S. public debt Repurchase agreement Credit score Economy of Cuba Debt consolidation Internet fraud Toronto-Dominion Bank Donald Trump Social Security debate (United States)

i have three questions about the housing market ok so due to the recent and i mean within hours of american mortgage filing bankruptcy due to the market crashing in the housing industry because of arm loans have some questions that i need some help understanding how many people in the united states are still paying on houses what percentage of those people have adjustable arm loans from their mortgage company and if the housing market fails and are economy is screwed up as it is now who is going to help out i mean back in the eighities they took dollars from everyones taxes and used it to supplement the failing savings and bonds now we are trillion dollars in debt who is going to pay for the now billion dollar housing failure ok i understand that it looks bad answering your questions probably won't do anyone that much good other than to re inforce what you already know so let's get real here and try to give you some help instead the truth of the matter is we are looking at loans that were sub prime loans that are going sour not the normal a loans so while there are a lot of them there are people both in and out of the industry working dilligently to solve these issues if you are one of the ones who find themselves in a bad spot and perhaps facing bankruptcy or foreclosure or both the best advice i can offer is this call the bank as soon as you see a problem ask for the loss mitigation department and explain your situation calmly if it is a long term problem realize sooner rather than later that you may have to sell the house to save your credit the credit is critical for the well being of yourself and your family in the future if you sell it even in a shortsale you may be able to actually buy another one in about a year the lenders want a year of no lates before they will lend today so if you can sell and get started on that year you are moving forward with your future and a wiser buyer you will be the next time sometimes the lessons we learn in life are learned the hard way but those are the ones that teach us the best it's ok you wouldn't be alone in this find a realtor who is experienced in short sales and foreclosure prevention and work with them they will ask you to sign a form that let's them speak to your lender on your behalf you may still have to move but you will have someone on your side in the process it's good to have a friend when you are up against that wall  Deflation (economics) Bond Debt Predatory lending Bank Government debt Economy of the United States Economy of Russia Student loan Insurance Financial markets Hyperinflation Microeconomics U.S. public debt Money supply Interest Donald Trump Money Government National Mortgage Association Citigroup Mergers and acquisitions Real estate Federal National Mortgage Association Supply and demand Capitalism Asian financial crisis Mutual fund FairTax Finance Inflation Foreclosure Security (finance) Microcredit Taxation in the United States Social Security (United States) Privatization Credit card Temasek Holdings Short selling Annuity Mortgage-backed security Economy of Pakistan Yield curve Personal finance Primerica Financial Services Economy of Argentina Real estate bubble Capital accumulation Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Title insurance United States dollar History of the United States (1918-1945) Unemployment Derivative (finance) Debt consolidation Economy of India Dot-com Corporation Marshall Plan Usury Subsidy Economy of Chile Keynesian economics Wal-Mart Say's law Treasury security Central bank Social Security debate (United States) Economics Debt levels and flows Supply-side economics Bank fraud Theory of conduct Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Economy of Cuba Economy of El Salvador Education in the United States Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Public policy Famine Stock market MMORPG Kyoto Protocol Arbitrage Economic relations of Japan Financial services Stock Developing countries' debt

what happens if your landlord doesn't let you move in on the day your lease starts hello before i signed my lease i told my landlord everything up front he knows i am pregnant he knows my lease ends at my old apt on the same day i move into my new apt and he knew i would have furniture delivered the day the lease started my lease with him starts tomorrow he never told me the prorated rate for this month so i did the math myself and guessed he never told me if i paid enough too much he never returned my phone calls on when i can pick up keys and today his cell phone is just turned off and goes right to voicemail when he showed the apt the person who lived there didn't care enough to clean it and make it look nice to show so i am worried he won't clean it when he leaves either also it is currently furnished but the landlord was going to remove all the furnishings before i moved in so with my lease starting tomorrow and no word from him yet what can i do i am terrified what if the furniture truck arrives and the old tenant hasn't cleaned up or the landlord hasn't moved out his furnishings or the old tenant isn't even gone i don't know what to do if i can't even get ahold of the guy he only rents out units total so i understand it is not his main job but i can't just leave my stuff outside the apt and wait around tomorrow ideas take pictures you can sue the landlord for the expense it takes you to have the apartment ready much like the way other landlords try to stick it to tenants moving out i am sure your movers will be happy to remove the furniture existing in the property for an extra fee or i suggest you look for another apartment to move into you can always get your deposit back from the first landlord if you never move in  Leasehold estate Friends Apartment Leasing Housing cooperative Apt Pupil Rental agreement Ocean's Twelve Shaggy dog story EastEnders Miss Saigon Kodocha Airport (film) Avenue Q The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Estoppel Rent (musical) Social rule Phoebe Halliwell Blood Simple StarCraft Episode VI Reservoir Dogs Renting Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City George Costanza Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kender Modding Pitaten Full Metal Panic?

will leasing my house effect my chances at getting another home loan or will it decrease my maximum looking at leasing my home but want to get a good home loan unless it's been long enough for you to report your lease income on taxes you should expect that every lender will discount whatever you rent your home for by to give a buffer in qualifying for vacancies and maintenance so for example you have a payment of mo you rent it out for mo the lender will count of that so you'll get credit for this will leave a payment remaining against your qualifying so yes it will decrease your maximum financing ability unless by some miracle you can rent it for much more than your payments and lenders will actually generally require an appraiser's estimate of market rent for that unit and use that number regardless of if you rent it for more  Mortgage Insurance Bond Student loan Finance Debt Monetary policy Predatory lending Deflation (economics) Interest Real estate broker Gross domestic product Leasehold estate Income statement Property tax Taxation in the United States United Kingdom corporation tax Bank Annuity Housing cooperative Capitalism Economy of India Government National Mortgage Association Economy of Russia Economy of El Salvador Leasing Economy of the United States Interest rate 401(k) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Debt consolidation Annual percentage rate Inflation Real estate Lender of last resort Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Centrelink Capital accumulation Money Auto insurance Central bank Value added Intermediate consumption Microeconomics Credit card FairTax Tax Stamp duty Economic rent Islamic banking Bretton Woods system Credit score Mergers and acquisitions Payday loan Title insurance Anarchism and capitalism Life insurance Estoppel Publicly funded medicine Productive and unproductive labour Subsidy Renting Municipal bond Kyoto Protocol Economy of Pakistan Unemployment benefit Short selling Salary cap Lend-Lease Credit history Personal finance Corporate finance Mobile home Real estate economics Social Security (United States) Primerica Financial Services Financial markets Argentine Currency Board Repurchase agreement Unemployment Section 8 (housing) Tax Reform Act of 1986 Money supply Temasek Holdings Great Depression Tertiary education fees in Australia Real estate appraisal Present value Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Normal distribution Cost of capital Economy of Fiji Education in the United States Income trust Collateralized debt obligation Operating surplus

how long it will take if i cancel services i'm going to move to a new house this sunday but if i want to cancel all the services phone internet tv water etc when should i cancel call them now and tell them to cut them off on monday they will not cut them over a weekend as it requires them to read out your meter so if you tell them you are moving on sunday and want things cut off on sunday chances are they will cut you off on friday as that is their last business day i always tell them to cut things off effective the day after i move out otherwise you risk them coming that morning and cutting things off and then you are left to load a truck with no a c and no running water in the bathroom neither of which are pleasant if the person moving in has already paid their deposits and set up their services to be cut on then they won't actually even cut anything off although they'll charge the new person a fee to cut it on they will just come out and read out your meters  Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March United States Postal Service Sunday Virgin Mobile Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans 2003 North America blackout MTV2 Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Big Brother (Australian TV series) Electricity meter The Standard CBC Radio One Daylight saving time Holy Week WNNX (FM) Avalanche Monday Jewish services Privatization Otakon Insurance Hurricane Katrina timeline Easter September 11, 2001 attack memorials and services London Congestion Charge Microphone Glacier Naval mine Liturgical year Monday Night Football Reaction to the assassination of John F.

legal question re ownership of house hi guys i have a question for all the expert legal minds out there my parents are separated and want to figure out an amicable arrangement for division of assets as part of the the agreement my dad has suggested we split the ownership of the house between him and me he has agreed to continue paying the mortgage on it until it is sold is this type of agreement legally enforceable and is there a way i can legally enforce it would i be entitled to of the value upon sale of the house or of income generated from the house because he is still the holder of the mortgage on the house i'm not sure how valid my claim would be any help would be appreciated greatly thank you o k well you have to take a look at the facts and circumstances the first thing you mentioned is that your parents are seperated but not yet divorced you went on to mention that your parents would like to file for a non contested divorce by noting that they wish to negotiate and talk out an amicable arrangement for division of assets first of all let's talk about the divorce it looks like your parents are going to talk it out if your mother is willing to leave the house uncontestedly there must either exist a well written pre nupt or other assets to which your father will not fight over when the divorce is finalized your father will have full ownership of the said house and your mother will have whatever else your father doesn't that being said you take no part in the split during the divorce process therefore this begs the question as of when will such an agreement be effective to answer that we must look beyond when such an agreement was made but to when it was properly put into motion this is what i mean suppose your father tells you that the house is yours you sign a contract seal it in blood on an official letterhead house gets sold check gets made out to your father and he gambles it all away the same day not saying that he will i'm sorry if your father has a gambling problem i didn't know i was just trying to make an example the point is what can you do well you can sue him for everything he's gambled away but how will that work out what will he pay your with now before we even go that far let's be realistic you father is a good guy his days or reckless gambling are long past him when the house gets sold he gets the check and refuses to give you anything you wind up in court in an effort to enforce his promise to pay you your well unfortunately for you you can't enforce this promise because a valid legally binding contract has not been formed it lacks the one basic element needed to form a contract consideration this promise sounds more like a gift and a gift is a promise that can be dishonored at any time by the giver with no legal consequenses so we get it this promise means nothing i can't take him to court it's not enforcable your dad's a liar well don't just call it a day yet if he made you this offer then he will still be willing to follow it through when you can do is place both names on the deed or title of the property and record it on public record with the county clerk's office this way when the house gets sold the title company notifies the buyer that you are an owner and your father is a owner therefore the buyer will now have to make out two checks one to you for of the selling price and one to your father for of the selling price however don't run up to the county clerk so fast there are huge ginormous consequenses for adding someone else to the deed or title of the property the bank can demand payment in full of the outstanding principle balance of the home loan in short almost nobody can afford to pay that amount within days so a default will occur this can be avoided if you first ask your bank the bank will probably say no because they are taking on additional risk by allowing an other name to appear on the deed and not recieving any additional interest revenue to compensate that in short you will have to find a bank which will be willing to help you refinance the home and allow you and your father to appear on the deed under the terms you have both agreed on split secret splits agreements are non binding on third parties when you record the deed include the split in the event someone takes out a loan the creditor has no way on knowing how much equity that person has and is lead to believe that either you or your father are simply owning the house jointly there is no part five i think i've said all there is to say talk it over with your father it's not a bad idea to sit down with a real estate attorney or general lawyer and get some advice on this issue state laws may vary and sometimes county laws can be restrictive on this issue i hope this entry was helpful i'm sorry for having you read so much best of luck on the whole situation  Leasing Plame affair SCO-Linux controversies Debt Capitalism Copyright Tax Bond Annuity Trust (Law) USA Capital accumulation

what is a short sale can someon tell me what a short sale is and what the pros and cons are jron a short sale is basically where you get a property for less what the owner owes on it so for example i have a k market value home but i owe k on it so can you can see i am upside down i owe more than what the house is worth if i want to sell the investor can send in a plethora of forms with the application of a short sale to my lender pros get house cheaper than what it owes higher profit potential if short sale is approved cons too much paperwork more troublesome to get because basically you're working with lenders on the deal most lenders will reject your first short sale waiting sucks  Mortgage Predatory lending Insurance Temasek Holdings Bank Privatization Rational pricing Microeconomics Corporation Debt Finance Financial markets Donald Trump Real estate broker Foreclosure DBS Bank Pharmaceutical company Citigroup Day trading Short (finance) Bond Government National Mortgage Association Radeon Title insurance United Overseas Bank Arguments for and against drug prohibition Security (finance) Interest Apple Macintosh FairTax Tax Federal National Mortgage Association Capital accumulation Computer and video game industry Air New Zealand Exchange value Bulk vending Auction Surplus value Mobile home Mergers and acquisitions Enron Corporation Takeover Mutual fund Fair use Nintendo GameCube Oil-for-Food Programme Predictive dialer Monetary policy Commodity Airline Great Depression Subsidy SCO-Linux controversies Jack Tramiel Equity investment Timeline of the Enron scandal Nintendo Arbitrage Illegal drug trade Microsoft Inflation Commodore International Ford Motor Company American Broadcasting Company Investment bank Repurchase agreement Quattro Pro Life insurance Xerox Derivative (finance) Gun politics Law of value Internet fraud Diamond 3dfx Student loan Valiant Comics Sinclair Research Ltd Real estate developer Delrina Social Security debate (United States) Atari ST Taxation in the United States Islamic banking Government debt Microsoft Office Property tax Warren Buffett Serfdom Tesco Wal-Mart ATI Technologies Apple Computer Bill Gates U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement Profit Economy of India

closing your real estate transaction using an attorney or escrow company living on the west coast use an attorney or escrow company to close on a purchase of a single family residence why the property is a median priced house i'm not sure from your question if you are asking if you should use an escrow company or an attorney or why you need to use an escrow or attorney to close on property in the case of escrow or attorney it's really a case of chicken or the egg an escrow company is typically a title company that starts by ensuring the title is free and marketable they then employ an attorney to draft the document that transfers the property from one person to another deed the escrow company has already set up an escrow account to transfer and hold money and dispense according to written instructions from buyer seller mortgage company etc an attorney will do what is required in the sales contract if title insurance is needed they will contact a title company to complete they also would have an escrow account to transfer proceeds from the sale back and forth the differences are escrow companies are typically seen as a neutral party they only do what is specificly requested by both the seller and buyer they also have more experience when it comes to working with difficult situations i would utilize for any transaction that was part of an estate where multiple heirs were involved have to have money left in escrow after the closing such as when repairs are needed etc when utilizing govenment programs for funding when multiple mortageges are issued on the property an attorney i usually utilize when transactions are more straight forward such as when the sale is more of a paperwork transaction such as a quit claim deed in a divorce or a land contract situation where the current owner is financing tyically an attorney is employed by one party of the transaction and thus not neutral it's not that an attorney couldn't do the more complicated transactions but typically attorneys charge by the hour and not the transaction most escrow companies charge a flat fee to open and close escrow in addition the escrow company has negotiated a rate with an attorney to draft the documents based on the number of documents they have drafted over a a years time which also reduces the cost felicia randall www cherrycapitalhomes com  Insurance Tax Microeconomics Advance fee fraud Contract Mutual fund Life insurance Attorney at Law Conveyancing Islamic banking Title insurance Oil-for-Food Programme Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Taxation in the United States Stock Supply and demand Intellectual property Monetary policy Futures contract Mergers and acquisitions Internet fraud Privatization Lawyer Leasing Short selling Real estate economics Deed Notary public Capitalism Financial markets Enron Corporation Construction Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Annuity SCO-Linux controversies Health insurance Credit card Option Corporation Bank Allodial title Surplus value CPU cache Economics Citigroup Publicly funded medicine American individualist anarchism Concurrent estate Value added tax Security (finance) Warranty FairTax Bond Labor theory of value Unconscionability Divorce Corporate finance Primerica Financial Services Easement Money Estoppel Real estate Monopoly (game) Oakland Athletics Arbitrage Property tax Digital rights management Mediation Babylonian law Property (ownership right) Real estate developer Real estate bubble Economy of Russia Productive and unproductive labour Call option Labour economics Illegal drug trade Housing cooperative Personal finance Octopus card Database American Broadcasting Company Patent Canada Health Act Bretton Woods system Salary cap

what is better renting out or selling your home i love my home but need to get a bigger house we thought about renting it out does anyone know how to go about this or would it be better to just sell it we want to try and make some money out of it if we can any thoughts thanks it depends on what you wnat to and are able to do for long term financial gain renting is by far the better option property investment is by far the best way to develop your financial future you retain ownership the renter pays all or most of the expenses you continue to get tax deductions off the rental property as years go by the rent will increase giving you a rising monthly income while property values will also increase giving you a much greater asset there are a couple of issues that are important though that could make this a bad choice for many people number one is will you originally get enough rent to pay the mortgage and expenses if you do it is a much easier situation but if you can't there may be years where you must pay a little every month out of your pocket to cover the difference between rent and mortgage many people can't do this fortunately most homes can be rented out to at least cover expenses there will have to be management and this is no easy thing you would either have to deal with being a landlord and dealing with renters and hundreds of books have been written on that subject are you willing to be called in the middle of the night because of a stopped toilet or you can hire a management company a management company will take of the rental income in fees which cuts into your monthly income but maybe worth it if you only deal with property questions monthly instead of daily i have owned rental properties both as a landlord who handled his own as well as having a management company take care of the properties it was quite profitable and if it hadn't been for a divorce that came along i would still be doing it with the glut of homes on the market now i am planning on re entering the market the decision depends on you being a landlord is a hands on investment you have to deal with people some of who are great some of who think all landlords are scum when in reality you are just a business person trying to provide an extremely important service if you have the right temperament it will be the best thing you ever did for your family's security if you don't it will be hell good luck  Mortgage Housing cooperative Personal finance Insurance Taxation in the United States Leasing Renting Mutual fund Microeconomics Warren Buffett Donald Trump United Kingdom corporation tax Monopoly (game) Annuity Life insurance FairTax Tax Capital accumulation Bond Leasehold estate Public housing Flat tax Capitalism Real estate bubble Security (finance) Property tax Citigroup Finance Intermediate consumption Economic rent Intellectual property Rental agreement Bank Health insurance Productive and unproductive labour 401(k) Anarchism and capitalism Privatization Progressive tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Value added Economy of the United States Stock Inflation Blockbuster Video Harlem Corporate finance Temasek Holdings Income trust First-sale doctrine Interest Socialist economics Operating surplus Real estate economics Corporation Hedge fund Economy of India Islamic banking Great Depression Supply and demand Political economy Social Security (United States) Property (ownership right) Gentrification National Kidney Foundation Singapore Credit card Predatory lending Labor theory of value Economy of Russia Income statement Unreformed House of Commons Accounting methods Divorce Trust (Law) USA PE ratio Economics Babylonian law Social Security debate (United States) Cable television Supply-side economics Real estate developer Wal-Mart Primerica Financial Services Capital gains tax Money Dividend Corporate governance Netflix Estoppel Debt

how can a k house cost mo w a rate at y fixed mortgage good friends of mine are about to become st time home owners and told me unflinchingly that their mortgage payment would be mo for a house less than k this is through national city bank and not even a broker they are using a year fixed rate at how is this possible i pointed out that using an amortization table their payments should be just under excluding taxes and home owners insurance neither of which could possibly explain the month difference they are living in the midwest in a lower tax area estimated the taxes are about yr i am trying to find the right way to explain to them that they are being taken advantage of without jeopordizing our friendship but i wanted to make sure there was nothing i was missing that could explain why they are paying month more than i think they should based on that purchase price and rate thanks definitely a year fixed not a year fixed not the property taxes they live in the country of ohio our taxes are low for this house about per year you should read the truth in lending disclosure which gives you the true annual percentage rate interest and all fees the total of payments the total of all interest etc personally and without a truth in lending calculator i think their figures are in the ballpark because of the years of interest due as a rough guideline the interest on a year loan will be about double the total principal so if they borrowed the total due over years will be that comes to roughly per month then you have to add the escrow for insurance and real estate taxes so per month seems reasonable don't forget they will get a sizeable tax deduction for their interest payments  Insurance Tax Taxation in the United States Annuity Bond FairTax Microeconomics Mutual fund Annual percentage rate Student loan Deflation (economics) Predatory lending Gross domestic product Inflation Islamic banking Government National Mortgage Association Real estate bubble Leasing Mortgage-backed security Title insurance Federal National Mortgage Association Health insurance Property tax Real estate broker Social Security (United States) Surplus value Municipal bond Interest Donald Trump Social Security debate (United States) National Insurance Warren Buffett Compensation of employees United Kingdom corporation tax Debt Variable universal life insurance Savings and loan association Collateralized mortgage obligation Microcredit Reaganomics Personal finance Economy of Pakistan Operating surplus Free trade Supply-side economics Monetary policy Publicly funded medicine Consumption of fixed capital Bank Value added tax Gold standard Government debt Unemployment Dividend Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Capitalism Productive and unproductive labour Economy of the United States Finance Stamp duty Inheritance tax Income tax Futures contract Capital gains tax Primerica Financial Services Value added Cost of capital Progressive tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Value product Certificate of deposit Salary cap Concurrent estate Intellectual property Unemployment benefit Mobile home History of the United States (1918-1945) Auto insurance Mergers and acquisitions Corporation U.S. public debt Islamic economics Subsidy Stock Hyperinflation Cost accounting Income trust

if i was to buy a piece of land in the us probably orlando what am i allowed to do with that piece of land and how could i buy a piece of land in the first place who should i go to just asking either way theplease believe me i don't mean to discourage you this is not an easy job to do its very demanding takes a lot of time and it takes a lot of money to find the piece of land you want for the purpose you want it for there are zoning laws and ordinances this means there are certain uses for certain pieces of land you come to the u s and go to orlando you find that perfect piece of land it just so happens there is a for sale sign on that land you call the number on the sign i m going to make this very simple for everyone there are at least two ways to look at this situation example your st question i m interested in that property on front main is it still for sale agent yes it is your nd question how much is it agent it s million your rd question that s perfect when can i come in to talk to you about it agent right now you go in to the office you are hot to trot you want that land you fill out the papers and make the deposit of one hundred fifty thousand dollars you sign the papers the seller signs the papers and you are happy but oh oh you can t use that piece of ground for what you thought you could use it for you can t split that ground into smaller pieces in fact that piece of ground you just paid million for can only be used for an airport why because that s what the mayor and the city s officers thought that would be the best use for that land you just bought a million pig in a poke its worthless to you you are stuck with it why because you didn t investigate anything about that land you thought you could use that land for anything you wanted any way you wanted you were wrong period end of story example this time you have a pretty good idea what to do you call about that same piece of land your st question i m interested in that property on front main is it still for sale agent yes it is your nd question could you please tell me what its zoned for agent sure it s zoned for an airport your rd question is there a possibility to split it up and sell smaller lots agent oh you mean sub divide it your rd question yes that s it sub divide it can i do that agent gee i just don t know i guess that s something you are going to have to find out your th question ok thank you could you please tell me where city hall is agent sure it s at broad market would you like directions to get there your th question yes please would you do that and the agent gives you directions then you go to city hall and find out the information you need you are told the only use for that land is an airport it can t be sub divided what do you do if i have to tell you every state is different every county in that state is different every municipality in that county in that state is different every piece of land in every municipality in that county in that state is different i can think of many many different circumstances and finally how could i buy a piece of land in the first place who should i go to when a person partnership or other business groups wants to buy land in the beginning and for the first two three or four projects the financing is very very hard to get what usually happens is the buyer pays cash for the land then the buyer is the owner and the owner sets up a construction loan during the time the land is under construction many times the lender wants monthly payments when the project is finished everything is put together in a mortgage the very best way to properly learn the business is working for a good reputable honest builder and management team preferably one whose name is recognizable in the area you re interested in investing in doing this should help put you in the field to get the necessary exposure knowledge and experience you'll need when you decide to do this on your own you should learn the proper and right way to run and manage the business you should ask your bosses and supervisors what books and periodicals they get and read to stay up to date with current trends and building codes you should also learn what not to do you should keep a career and vocational journal on your computer update it each and every day it makes things a lot easier especially when you may need some information about how a particular problem or situation was resolved or dusted off to refresh your memory sometime in the distant future now for some nuts and bolts you'll be dealing with raw unimproved no water sewer or utilities land this means there are no roads other than the roads and highways which border or possibly divide the land you're interested in developing you'll need money to buy that land or at the very least money to buy the option for that land you'll need money to make your presentations before various local and county governments you may even have to state your case before a u s government agency this does not mean you'll automatically get approved for the project you have in mind be it residential commercial industrial or special use the citizens and residents in that area will also have the opportunity to present their points of view for and against your particular project s you'll find some folks will be dead set against your ideas and projects from the very start why here are just reasons a one or more of the citizens could possibly believe their piece of land which you never talked with them about selling would be more suitable for your particular project because you didn't even ask them about selling their land to you they could feel they lost a lot of money b one or more of the citizens could feel the area doesn't need your idea developed at all they like the open spaces in their area they're very happy the roads aren't crowded with cars and trucks they like the rural environment they're currently living in and they want to keep it that way c they don't want to pay any more real estate taxes or for that matter any more taxes at all for more municipal services meaning employees police force fire department including schools your development could bring to that area and those are only reasons believe me there are many more then you'll need more money for surveyors impact studies and many other types of projects and obstacles too many to mention here and you haven't even had your ceremonial ground breaking ceremony yet after that ceremony this is when the heavy equipment comes in and starts grading for the roads and the lots and the improvements water sewer gas electric telephone fiber optics etc the main question are you prepared mentally physically and financially to do this answer you may be prepared mentally and physically but financially you'll probably have to borrow a lot of money and or form a corporation and sell shares in the corporation to raise that much needed either way the lender wants to be paid on a regular basis your shareholders deserve a fair return on their investment don't they i know i provided quite a lot for you to think about and consider thank you for asking your question i enjoyed taking the time to answer your question you did a great job not only for your information but for every other person interested in reading my answer i wish you well vty ron b  Annuity Finance United Kingdom

do condominiums usually allow pets each condominium development has a governing board association that works much like congress it makes rules and maintains the property by managing the fees you pay each month while some condos may have rules against pets or restrictions as to the size of the pet these same restrictions can be repealed the best way to get your way in this regard is to become a congressman member of the association board and in many cases this is an easy feat because most don't want to take the time to get involved  Condominium United States House of Representatives Housing cooperative Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Public domain Cable television Congress of the United States Donald Trump Article One of the United States Constitution First Amendment to the United States Constitution Jean Schmidt Football (soccer) Homeowners association FairTax American individualist anarchism North York, Ontario McMansion Treaty Neopets Taxation in the United States Controlled Substances Act Carl G.

how can i buy a house can i buy a house on a disability check im a year old man who is also a single dad and im disabled from working so i get one check a month to live on plus to make things worse my credit is bad so is it even possible for me to buy my frist house the american dream is it possible for me if not how can i fix this can i fix this without it taking time wouldn't it be awesome if the first answerer was right the sad part is that without decent credit you are likely out of luck the disability check is not an issue and is seen as steady income which is a good thing there are government programs designed to help cover down payment and closings costs and special interest rates for middle to lower income buyers but they all require you qualify for something equal to an fha loan the good news is that an fha loan isn't as credit score sensitive as other programs are and you can qualify for one simply by having no late pays in the previous months and have a limited amount of debts in collections some things may not have to be paid off most people think their credit is a lot worse than is actually the case so i suggest you speak to a mortgage broker before you conclude anything yourself  Mortgage Student loan Government National Mortgage Association Bond FairTax Life insurance Debt Credit card Mutual fund Microeconomics History of the United States (1918-1945) Deflation (economics) Islamic banking Monetary policy Capital accumulation Annuity 401(k) Real estate broker Economy of Russia Interest Taxation in the United States Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Economy of the United States Futures contract Poker jargon Unemployment Social Security (United States) Security (finance) Personal finance Betting (poker) Municipal bond Tax Mortgage-backed security Gold standard Inflation Money Surplus value Derivative (finance) Privatization Arbitrage Bretton Woods system Gross domestic product Supply and demand Capitalism Education in the United States Credit score Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Health insurance Economics Primerica Financial Services Anarchism and capitalism Stock Money supply Microcredit Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Annual percentage rate Internet fraud American individualist anarchism Social Security debate (United States) Plame affair Euro Property tax Corporation Savings and loan association Money creation Debt consolidation Title insurance Contract Day trading Hyperinflation Copyright Mergers and acquisitions Social Credit School of Salamanca Collateralized mortgage obligation Debt levels and flows Divorce Collision detection CPU cache Debugging Subsidy Estoppel Nuclear option (filibuster)

if i partake in a land contract can i sue the person on the first mortgage if they don't make timely payments how does this work legally i'm trying to find more financing options and this sounds safe the only thing i'm worried about is if the seller decides to default on their st mortgage there would be an attorney involved i'm not entirely stupid we've been doing real estate land contracts for over years and if done properly you really don't have to worry about the seller taking the money you send for payment on the first mortgage and going to the casino instead the key to guaranteeing you that the mortgage will be paid by the seller when you make your payment to the seller is in the escrow company instructions you must have the seller agree within the contract that when you make the payment the amount received by the escrow company will be disbursed first to pay the underlying debt of the mortgage that the seller owes with the balance payable to the seller at the end of the year the escrow company third uninterested party licensed to be an escrow company will send you a showing how much interest you have paid on your debt to the seller default of the mortgage would now fall on you if your payment is not made and not on the seller who is relying on you to make their first mortgage payment best of luck to you  Mortgage Derivative (finance) Real estate broker Islamic banking Life insurance Debt Annuity Contract Insurance Security (finance) Allodial title Short selling Student loan Collateralized mortgage obligation Unconscionability Option Taxation in the United States 401(k) Assignment (law) Credit card Personal finance Title insurance Concurrent estate Credit derivative Microeconomics Bank Advance fee fraud Futures contract Tax Donald Trump Internet fraud Interest Monopoly (game) Leasing Oil-for-Food Programme Money Estoppel Put option Corporate finance Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Construction Public-key cryptography Arbitrage Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Call option Deflation (economics) Intellectual property FairTax Commodity markets Primerica Financial Services U.S. public debt Credit default swap Conveyancing Mutual fund Consideration Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Government debt Salary cap E-mail spam Health insurance Real estate bubble Annual percentage rate Rational pricing Stock Child support Real estate Cheque Economy of the United States Bank fraud Gold standard Housing cooperative Credit score Credit risk Predatory lending Trust (Law) USA Capitalism Babylonian law Lawyer Pyramid scheme Treasury security Finance Real estate developer Copyleft Betting (poker) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Actuarial notation Accounting methods Schabir Shaik Trial Cost of capital Liability

cosigning an apartment with somebody for a year than leaving i am currently on a lease that i cosigned with somebody else in february it is for a bedroom bath apartment all utilities are included except for cable and internet if i decide not to renew the lease and move out can my room mate keep the apartment and can she be the only one the lease or would she have to find another room mate is it possible for somebody to lease an apartment for a year by themselves at mos they get a room mate for mos can she and the other person cosign a lease or is cosigning strictly for year long terms i thought that she and i were cosigners because the full rent of the apartment is a month she pays and i pay another supposedly if i tried to get out of it in the middle of the lease if she did not want to pay for the other half or if she did not find a roomie who could pay for my half that i would have to be responsible it is confusing because i was told if i took my name off of the lease and somebody put their name on it if they did not pay their part of the rent or messed something up in the house it would mess up my credit when you and your roommate signed your lease you both promised to rent the apartment for the full term of the contract once the contract has been fulfilled the question of whether or not your roommate and a different roommate or your roommate by herself can remain and sign a new lease is completely at the discretion of the landlord leases are never the same some say you can have roommates some don't allow them and others say yes but there will be an extra charge the thing to remember is that the original lease is a contract between the landlord and the original tenants and if another person comes along looking for a place to live they have no rights or responsibilities to the property unless the the landlord acknowledges them as a tenant too by the same token you will always be a tenant with rights and responsibilities to the property unless the landlord has given you written permission otherwise  Leasehold estate Leasing Rental agreement Apartment Estoppel Babylonian law Chatham Square Vista Way The Commons Apartment building NorthBridge Apartment Complex Property (ownership right) Monopoly (game) Irish Land Act Chatsworth House Friends Stuyvesant Town Land reform Housing cooperative Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Rent (musical) Public housing Property law Renting Manorialism Contract Boston and Lowell Railroad Plame affair Harlem American individualist anarchism Concurrent estate Hani Hanjour Islamic banking SCO-Linux controversies Section 8 (housing) Student loan 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Modding Serfdom Oakland Athletics Intellectual property The Inside Rent control Unreformed House of Commons Social rule Judiciary of Hong Kong First-sale doctrine Assignment (law) Miss Saigon Condominium Mortgage Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory Squatting Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim George W.

what is the general cost to start in real estate i have researched the basics of getting into real estate such as the classes you need the cost of the license the test you need to take and other legal matters my main question is how much money is typically needed to really get going i live in georgia and am pretty sure that the cost of the license is and the test is i've heard that in person classes range from while online classes go between and that you shouldn't take the online classes if someone could elaborate on this it would be much appreciated also a ballpark estimate of how much money would be needed for other fees that pop up such as advertising yourself i live at home with parents currently so living expenses would be minimum any information would be much appreciated advertising prices vary and when you advertise in newspapers sometimes certain companies offer special deals one cost you aren't considering is the fees to join and maintain a membership to your local board of realtors which in my neck of the woods costs about a year also it might be necessary for you to keep errors and omissions insurance which will likely cost you a year then there are the everyday expenses that catch when you aren't looking like gas color copies signs or the rider signs with your name and phone number you put with your company signs continuing education lock boxes and or the electronic key to open them cell phone your usage will rise and other office expenses the big one is that after all that you have to split your commission with your broker often when starting out i hope this helps you toward your final tally  Insurance Real estate broker Mutual fund Lawyer Education in the United States United States Postal Service Credit card Cable television Taxation in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Wal-Mart Life insurance Software patent debate Acorn Computers Pharmaceutical company National Kidney Foundation Singapore Broadband Internet access Microsoft Floppy disk E-mail spam Tax Intellectual property Advertising Microeconomics Graduate school Medical prescription Homeschooling Solar power Internet fraud Sears Holdings Corporation Spam (electronic) Education in Germany Plastic Doomsday argument Day trading Mach kernel Stock Monopoly (game) Computer Notary public Modem Blackjack Voice over IP Verizon Wireless Contract Public domain Surveillance Auction Paintball Global Positioning System Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Pretty Good Privacy Nuclear power RFID GNU General Public License Password Morse Code Opera (web browser) Trust (Law) USA Real estate economics Warren Buffett Annuity Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Poker jargon Motion picture rating system Euro Illegal drug trade Hydrogen economy Food and Drug Administration Mortgage Alcohol fuel Taxicab Chiropractic ITunes Music Store U.S. presidential election, 2000 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Publicly funded medicine Am730 Photography Micropayment American Broadcasting Company E85 Embedded system Citigroup America Online Open-source software Digital circuit Billboard (advertising) Transformation problem

what are the chances a bank will try and actually collect from a deficiency judgement i know i will have a deficiency judgement once house sell at auction going to foreclosure soon since prices have dropped in market this house is at i was wondering what are the chances that they will go for my assets i spoke to them only once and asked them if they would try and actaully take my money if the house sells for less was asking about shortsale and they said no that they would only note on my credit score that i have a deficiency judgement and will be there for years which i dont care as long as they dont take my money so im thinking and hoping no also the house i live in is under wifes name will it affect her it say on the papers the sue is against me and unknown spouse but i was unmarried at the time can they put a lean againts where i currently live its under her name only do the banks actually take money out of your account or paychecks how does it work and is it common them trying to collect the deficiency most lenders will not go after a person once the property is foreclosed on this is the collateral they lent on and this it the collateral they collect to pay off any loans owed them the foreclosure will appear on your credit report for a certain length of time as time goes on this becomes less and less important it appears as if you live in a community property state where as what is owned by you and your spouse is half owned by the other since you were not married at the time and you were the only one that signed the loan docs they will only go after you they normally can not take a property that they did not finance or cross collateralized against the property they are foreclosing on so it appears as if your wife and her property is ok and will not be bothered since they have told you they will not go for a deficiency judgment your pay check will not be garnished or your bank account will not be bothered i hope this has been of some use to you good luck fight on  Mortgage Bond Foreclosure Divorce Bank Security (finance) Finance Credit card Concurrent estate Predatory lending Great Depression Money supply Marriage Citigroup Short selling Temasek Holdings Monetary policy Government National Mortgage Association Economy of Russia Donald Trump Gold standard Derivative (finance) Central bank Corporation Bank fraud Debt consolidation Money Interest Financial markets Debt Contract Annuity Usury Privatization Schabir Shaik Trial Real estate Universal Studios Government debt Taxation in the United States Hyperinflation Capitalism Warren Buffett Economy of India Tax Collateralized debt obligation Financial services Mikhail Khodorkovsky Islamic banking Real estate broker Insurance Student loan Social Security (United States) Mortgage-backed security Credit score Microcredit Wal-Mart Internet fraud Asian financial crisis Capital accumulation Auction Federal National Mortgage Association Babylonian law Fractional-reserve banking Economy of Pakistan Microeconomics ACORN Probate SCO-Linux controversies Margin (finance) Mutual fund Bretton Woods system Banknote Education in the United States Islamic economics FairTax Cheque Estoppel Stock market Repurchase agreement Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Lender of last resort Savings and loan association Anarchism and capitalism 401(k) Mensal__o scandal Economy of Chile American individualist anarchism Allodial title

buy or lease option survey would you agree to a lease option on a property you want to live in even if it means paying month more than rent going toward the principal hi it depends on your situation if your credit could use some improvement it might be worth it to take an option for a year clean up your credit and get a better interest rate also depending on the sales price of the house the extra towards the down payment might help on your loan to value ratios if the market in your area looks like it is improving you can tie up the property at today s value and the increase in value will be reflected when you exercise the option the other plus for a lease option is that some lenders will write the mortgage as a re finance not a brand new loan and that will help you save on the interest rate and make the loan easier to get hypothetically no loan transaction ever seems to go smoothly the down side the seller could rig the paperwork to make sure you can t possibly exercise the option adding in penalties for instance also he could be inflating the price because he is offering the lease option to you get a valid appraisal don t use his the property values may drop in a year which means that you may not want to exercise the option and you would lose your option money and the in extra rent that would have been credited if the property values drop you may be able to re negotiate the price so do your due diligence on the seller as well as the property i know investors with very good reputations but they will still shave you in a deal i know others who will bend over backwards to cut you a break so a lot of different factors best of luck to you barbara www therealestatebirddog com  Mortgage Microeconomics Bond Interest Money Derivative (finance) Islamic banking Capitalism Deflation (economics) Predatory lending Taxation in the United States Insurance Bank Mortgage-backed security Capital accumulation Student loan Annuity Surplus value Real estate broker Short selling Debt Inflation Hyperinflation Leasing Supply and demand Financial markets Real estate bubble Temasek Holdings Free trade Monetary policy Gold standard Great Depression Option Security (finance) Law of value Life insurance Unconscionability Rational pricing Arbitrage Citigroup Credit card Health insurance Contract Interest rate Gross domestic product Finance Monopoly (game) Call option Mergers and acquisitions Anarchism and capitalism Hire purchase Federal National Mortgage Association Economy of India Enron Corporation Tax FairTax Yield curve Collateralized debt obligation Mutual fund Bretton Woods system Primerica Financial Services Warren Buffett Repurchase agreement PE ratio Value added tax Option style 401(k) Labor theory of value Privatization Leasehold estate Put option Credit score Black-Scholes Stamp duty Property tax United Kingdom corporation tax Housing cooperative Personal finance Donald Trump Price discrimination Economy of Chile British residential property market Intellectual property Government debt Annual percentage rate Commodity Exchange rate Credit derivative Employee stock option Title insurance Subsidy Illegal drug trade

co signer what does it mean when a house is in a co signer's name instead of the seller of the house we are the buyers does the seller still get money or not also why did they do an appaisal on it and does this mean seller has to move the seller is talking about suing the loan officer why please answer all questions thanks n additional details hours ago the seller inherited the house from her parents when they passed away u need a co signer for that also she owes the bank a bunch of money they say they gave her money to fix the house up but she never did she is bankrupt is trying to refinance can she do that up till now i guess the house was in her name suddenly now it's only in the bank's name does that mean it's a foreclosure or they did that on purpose so we can close on the house already what happens to her does she still get the money or no and does she have to move out now please revise your answers thanks n and they keep delaying the closing what's the longest a closing has ever been delayed we were supposed to close on may st they said they're waiting for some guy to say yes on monday what do they mean everything's ready ' i've been hearing for weeks in a row should we just foreget it already o and how do i know if it's in foreclosure i think they might be moving o and how do i know if it's in foreclosure i think they might be moving this situation sounds familiar to me i am willing to be that the seller made a last ditch effort to avoid foreclosure by giving the deed to the lender aka deed in lieu after trying to refinance the property and failing a deed in lieu can't be done without the approval of a specific person in government which i can't remember his title but it is simply a matter of being sign off on the seller does not stand to receive any money from the sale the house was likely originally purchased with a cosigner and had a deed of survivorship once the cosigner passed away there was no need to re record the deed with only the sellers name on title the seller sounds like a pretty desperate person in serious financial trouble the sellers threat to sue the mortgage broker is likely out of frustration as to when she must vacate the property that is up to the bank to evict her obviously this must be done prior to closing because you aren't going to close knowing you will have to deal with a squatter i suggest you give the bank who is now the seller the heads up on this issue as to avoid another delay this contract has had to expire by now giving you the option to walk away from this whole situation if you choose  Mortgage Real estate broker Foreclosure Contract Great Depression Microeconomics Predatory lending Student loan Security (finance) Wheel of Fortune Article One of the United States Constitution Short selling Concurrent estate Insurance Title insurance Deflation (economics) Conveyancing Tax Allodial title Islamic banking Option Plame affair Canadian Senate Derivative (finance) Unconscionability Act of Parliament Financial markets Bank Internet fraud Bond ACORN Life insurance Annuity EastEnders Citigroup Notary public British House of Commons Trademark Big Brother UK series 6 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mutual fund Social rule Enron Corporation New Deal CPU cache Spice Girls Family Feud Big Brother (USA TV series) United Kingdom corporation tax Futures contract Intelligent design movement FairTax Donald Trump Stock market 401(k) SCO-Linux controversies Autograph She Loves You Corporation Schabir Shaik Trial Oil-for-Food Programme Adverse possession House of Lords ITunes Music Store Temasek Holdings Theory of conduct Mensal__o scandal Same-sex marriage in Canada Trust (Law) USA Shaggy dog story 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004 Government debt Oakland Athletics Intellectual property Hyperinflation Taxation in the United States Inflation Tennessee State Constitution Money World Championship Wrestling Ken Jennings Land reform Hulk Hogan Trust (Law) non-USA History of the United States (1918-1945) Password Construction

is it possible to buy half of a duplex my landlord owns a unit duplex the units are only joined at the garage i e each unit has it's own garage other than that there is no physical connection but they do share a common driveway is it possible to parcel one unit as a separate property and sell it the answer to that lies in municipal ordinance most duplexes cannot be thusly separated because they would be joined directly at the lot line and municipalities normally have lot line 'setbacks' which would prevent this from occurring if the duplex is relatively new the municipality allows zero lot line development and the structure was built under such an agreement then it may be possible as well your municipality may require a specific type of 'fire wall' separating the area where the structures join lack of such a fire wall can also create problems in obtaining homeowner insurance if you are able to separate this thing legally you will need to check with the city zoning department to determine the answer to your question  Ethernet Easement Insurance TGV McMansion Surveying Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mortgage Property tax Mobile home Bungalow Zoning Chess problem terminology Israeli West Bank barrier Construction Expert system Contract Property (ownership right) Slide rule Politics of the United States Modem Leasing Scientology beliefs and practices Estoppel Glossary of firefighting terms SCO-Linux controversies Mediation Quizbowl Separation of powers Microeconomics Capitalism Quality of service Intellectual property Semi-detached Counties of the United States Handloading Trademark United States Postal Service Seismic retrofit ZIP Code Patent Divorce Welding Suburbs of Johannesburg Education in the United States Pacific, Missouri Paintball Collision detection Publicly funded medicine Citigroup SimCity 4 Local government in the United Kingdom Internet Relay Chat Legal research A Course In Miracles Spontaneous human combustion Political subdivisions of New York State Elis Prefecture CPU cache Classified information Taxicab Database Separation of church and state Springfield, Massachusetts Mathematics Crossword Taxation in the United States Coercion Stairway Van Sweringen brothers Life insurance Oceanic trench Object-oriented programming DNA Animal Liberation Front Manifold Medicine Highway Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Corporation Digital rights management Rental agreement Copyright Redundant array of independent disks Condominium Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited Police Capital accumulation G__del's incompleteness theorem Mutual fund Unreformed House of Commons Pretty Good Privacy Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Commune in France GED Housing cooperative Intelligent design Natural deduction Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Nuclear magnetic resonance

can you extend your lease on a lease hold flat can you buy the freehold yes ignore ignorant person above basically you can definately extend the lease provided you have owned the property for two years there is a set legal process to go through which essentially involves agreeing a value with the freeholder for the extension and then getting a new lease drawn up this is usually relatively straightforward but if things break down needs to go to an indepenent panel to decide on the value if you aren't very sure about how to proceed it might be worth speaking to a solicitor but have a look at this site first http www jeremyleaf co uk surveying lease extension htm in terms of buying the freehold thats a bit more complicated and depends on circumstances often it will require all a majority of the tenants to take buy the freehold rather than one person you see there are additional issues that arise from being the freeholder which you might not have considered particularly upkeep of communal areas bricks and mortar insurance utilitiy bills for outside areas it is very difficult to set out who should be responsible for this when there is a mixture of leasehold and freehold ownership essentially therefore not impossible but you would be better speaking to a solicitor surveyor about your specific circumstances  Leasing Estoppel Leasehold estate Real property Microeconomics Poker jargon Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Construction Public domain Surveying Due process Life insurance Insurance Unreformed House of Commons ITU-T Allodial title Domain Name System Rental agreement Capitalism Contract Property law Scots law Fathers' rights Barrister Mortgage Democracy Blackjack First Amendment to the United States Constitution Health insurance Escheat Uniform Resource Locator Capital accumulation Notary public United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company Copyright law of the United Kingdom Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Abortion debate Auto insurance Essex County, New Jersey Mental Health Act 1983 First-sale doctrine Housing cooperative Enron Corporation Sexual orientation Unlawful combatant Fee simple Domestic partnerships in California Surplus value Judicial functions of the House of Lords Judiciary of Hong Kong Legal system of Hong Kong United Kingdom corporation tax Common Unix Printing System Australian constitutional law Consensus decision-making Anarcho-capitalism Who is a Jew?
