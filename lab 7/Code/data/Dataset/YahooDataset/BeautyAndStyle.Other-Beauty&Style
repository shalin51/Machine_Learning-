why do woman have to choose whether or not to wear make up my husband says there is no one telling him he should wear mak up no one is convncing him to he does not see it as a choice fom himself at all it is not even a thought in his mind on the other hand i quit wearing it about a year ago but i still feel like i have to wear it sometimes job interviews for example i also cut my hair short and stopped wearing dresses skirts this was a very painful transition and still is i feel like a stranger in my own body a straight woman rejecting beauty for herself not easy one woman told me that i should just be a lesbian a man told me he felt sorry for my husband when i cut my hair the choice to stop wearing make up has definetly been one of the hardest things i have ever done sick huh even more sick though was wearing it i was never really doing it for me even though i tried to convinve myself i was i told myself that it made me feel good but what i wanted more than anything was just to feel good without it like a man my husband is not my concern my concern is why is it only a choice for females im saying that it is sexist and that is why i do buy into false feminine ways ie make up highheels dresses correction do not buy into why does july get it but the rest of you do not society the media everywhere we look women are told that they have to do so many things to look beautiful this culture has convinced women that they are not attractive enough they have to wear makeup be rail thin but have great curves hold down a full time job take care of the family chores raise the babies but not lose their figures being pregnant and be ready for sex anytime a man wants it the worst part is most of us have fallen for it so we spend millions of dollars on makeup and make ourselves miserable trying to be someone else's image of the perfect woman if your husband is happy it is because he appreciates your inner beauty which he sees every time he looks at you be yourself and having made the choice don't give respect to anyone by letting them hurt your feelings and definitely stay away from those people who say ugly things life is too short to spend it with bad people  Gender role Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Friends Marilyn Monroe Social rule Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Amber Spyglass Abortion debate Skirt and dress Sin City Gender-neutral language Sexual orientation Domestic violence Kodocha Pitaten Clothing Avenue Q Transgender One Tree Hill (TV series) Joke Beavis and Butt-head The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex The Apprentice 2 The Catcher in the Rye Transsexuality Humphrey Bogart Hijab Woman Shaggy dog story Theodicy Strap-on dildo Women in Islam Infantilism Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Jon Secada Tightlacing Jam (TV series) Gay slang Human sexual behavior Cross-dressing Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Hair Rais massacre Aesthetic Realism The Inside Kimi Finster Goodness and value theory Poker jargon Characters in the Smurfs Economic inequality God and gender Everwood The Ashlee Simpson Show George Costanza Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Spidey Super Stories Fast bowling Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Socrates Aristasia Boston Public American Psycho Le Malade imaginaire Utilitarianism W.I.T.C.H.

why do people get into a relationship i mean not every couple marriage is going to be perfect and longlasting but then again why are people getting into in a relationship or a marriage then just to have someone hang around them and make them feel good or important or sexy or have a sex buddy or what don't you think people take you dunno whats out there unless you try thing in dating too far like having the you keep trying dating until you find the one attitude won't that process actually cause a lot more hurt and pain and make things complicated look at the amount of divorces nowadays jeeze louize and its like dating and breaking up prepares us for that yo sport people get into relationships for literally thousands of reasons you have people who get involved because they are driven to have someone at any and all costs yet others simply because they think that that is just the way that it is yet others get involved in relationships because they want to prove something to the world that they are what ever they think that that means a validation of their manhood or female prowse that they are desirable that they are accepted a lot of the reason that love falls apart on people is the fact that a lot of love isn't love at all a major chunk of the love relationships that exist today are based in two people showing one another their absolute best side and nothing more through a dating ritual that includes the two of them pushing a scam on one another hiding all their true selves and showing nothing but the best they have to offer and a lot of these people are hunting for someone to fullfill their dreams not thinking for a moment about what part they play in the fulfillment of the other person's dreams guys marry for someone to have their children and to make them feel great sexually and take care of their envoirnment for them normally there are variations here as well gals marry to have a father for their offspring that is reliable and a good provider someone to provide security and the things that they see as essential to a good life here too there are many variations but people have a tendency to be so anxious to have that one big something happen in their life they work double hard at making that happen even to the point of turning blind eyes toward major problems within the relationship while the dating thing is going on and making all kinds of concessions simply to make it happen for the two of them they create relationships a good deal of the time where no real basis for relationships exists then when the day to day life starts to drone on through months and years of being with this person that is so different than they remember them to be while dating it becomes apparent that the individual that they are tied to is not the person they thought they were and it becomes apparent quite rapidly in these types of relationships that this person is not nearly so interested in providing them with their dreams as they are of having their dreams fulfilled dating should be two people getting to know one another on a gradually deepening term where both people learn of one another through many life experiences and there should be break ups when these terms are seen to not be working this is the only way that people can find the combination with a particular individual that does work when you find that one someone whose happiness means more to you than your own you have found love at least for that person now the hard part is do they feel this for you if that is what it is then you are very lucky indeed for now you have something to base a mutual future on otherwise it is simply two people getting together with their own gratifications in mind and two greedy self centered individuals do not form a bright future on any level at all  Infantilism Theory of conduct Human sexual behavior Goodness and value theory A Course In Miracles Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Happiness Social rule Sexual orientation Theodicy Narcissism One Tree Hill (TV series) The nature of God in Western theology Summa Theologiae Microeconomics S__ren Kierkegaard Friedrich Schleiermacher Scientology beliefs and practices Sex and the City Supply and demand Philosophical skepticism Time Out of Mind Abortion debate Meaning of life Eastern Orthodox Church About a Boy Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Fathers' rights Friends The Ashlee Simpson Show Same-sex marriage Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Economic inequality Sexual abstinence Utilitarianism Alcoholics Anonymous Sex Predestination Nicomachean Ethics Jon Secada Anarchism and society Ontological argument Human Contract Sant Thakar Singh Days of our Lives Love Law of value Philosophy of language Milton H.

business casual appropriate for tomorrow business casual tomorrow i'll be going to a hiring fair for employment in an amusment park somewhat like six flags it says to wear business casual so far as it will be really hot tomorrow i'm thinking a pink striped dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up navy dress pants or should i go with black flat black shoes i hate heels any other suggestions and i'm contemplating on the bag of choice as i am a student i think it would look more appropriate to blend in with the other mass of students to wear a backpack but i dunno therefore the question is please critique this choice of wardrobe and if it is suitable for business casual and please help me find some alternatives that will work better etc etc thanks your outfit sounds good and take a small purse rather than a backpack flat shoes are fine as long as they are not run down an alternative would be a wedge heel they are fairly comfortable also make sure your hair nails and makeup are neat and well groomed good luck  Suit (clothes) Kimono Shoe Black tie Canadian Armed Forces Social aspects of clothing Cowboy Hasidic Judaism Marching band Bob Jones University Violin Heavy metal fashion Mess dress Beachwear High-heeled shoe Kilt Culture of the United States Softball Jesuit College Preparatory School Clown Rock (music) The Warriors Morning dress Starfleet ranks and insignia Clothing Mario Shirt Paul Is Dead Casual Eric Cartman The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe School uniform Sock DisneySpeak Jill Valentine Leggings Necktie Gothic Lolita Equine conformation Sento Grunge music Extreme Programming Academia Death rock fashion Billiards Sea Scouts (BSA) Customs and etiquette of Japan Undergarment Nakoruru (Samurai Shodown) Modern Western square dance Ada Wong Singapore Police Force Sheryl Crow The Smiths Reservoir Dogs Green Day Swimming pool Knitting Academic dress Taxicab Chun-Li Veruca Salt Johnny Appleseed Joker (comics) White-collar worker Skirt and dress Singlish Trailer Park Boys Horseshoe Punk fashion Billie Jean Knife Teen Girl Squad Black Flag (band) Apollo 11 Royal Canadian Mounted Police Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dress shirt Horse Unemployment Hamster Golf Nine Inch Nails Barbie The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Court dress Napoleon Dynamite Backpack Climbing equipment Spidey Super Stories Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Recess (TV series) Jeans Beavis and Butt-head Ed, Edd n Eddy Black

advice on being the new girl ok i'm a year old girl going into th grade i went to a private school before and now i'm in a new state at a public school so it's a big difference and i haven't met anyone here yet cuz at my apartment complex where we r temporarily living there aren't any kids my age so i need tips on what to do on the first day of school to meet people and how to make friends i forgot cuz i haven't been the new kid since st grade also i need tips on how to do my makeup and an outfit for the first day i went to paris over the summer and got my haircut there so it's cute of course and i like it the way it is so the stores i shop at are mostly abercrombiekids and hollister but i shop at american eagle too so thanks in advance join a club trust me it works i was the new girl a few years ago and waiting for someone to walk up to you and ask to be your friend won't help whatever you're interested in there's probably a club for it it really helps when you're shy and want to make friends extra advice be outgoing and don't try too hard to be liked be yourself good luck  Humphrey Bogart Jon Secada AFI 100 Years series Pitaten Girls Aloud Can't Hardly Wait Teen Girl Squad Boy Meets World Recess (TV series) Social rule The Adventures of Pete & Pete Boston Public Abercrombie & Fitch Co.

i hate my eyebrows please help i have thick ugly bushy eyebrows i got them waxed before and they were still bushy people even made fun of my eyebrows i really want to get them done so they are not bushy do you have any pics of someone with really nice eyebrows thanks steps get them waxed if you want remember waxing is one big ouch whereas tweezing is lots of little ouches and it takes longer if you have decided to tweeze make sure you know what you are doing get a tweezer and carefully pinch the hair close to the skin you are trying to take out pull the hair up or straight out never pull the hair down you will just break the hair try not to tweeze on top of your eyebrow pluck after a shower so the hairs are soft another option is threading which is used mostly in the indian culture and takes a little longer but the eyebrows can be shaped more precise and hurts less then waxing if you're still not satisfied with the shape or you think your eyebrows are messy take a preferably new toothbrush spray it with hairspray and then rub the brush over your eyebrows to shape them as you want them this also keeps the hairs down tips if the tweezing hurts too much rub an ice cube or hot washcloth over your brows when you're done moisturize your eyebrows so you don't get all those annoying little bumps get a mirror with good magnification tweezing underneath your brows hurts more than in the middle be prepared warnings do not use a razor on your brows they will just grow in quicker and it's not as precise do not overpluck they don't always grow back in don' t pinch your skin it really hurts hope this helps  Casting Pubic hair Knife Dreadlocks Textile manufacturing Hair Manicure Aerial (dance move) Social rule Violin Customs and etiquette of Japan Leather Drill bit Cross-country skiing Waxing Volleyball Equine conformation Characters in the Smurfs Shaving Strap-on dildo Dragon Booster Cruising (maritime) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Double bass Comanche Internal ballistics Cheese Shaggy dog story Mummy Guitar Unibrow Kodocha Bass guitar Piccolo Junior Saga Towel Hip hop rivalries Moustache 1957 World Series RuneScape quests Psoriasis Pitaten Acne Weaving Leaf Cannabis cultivation Sento Cosmetics Happy Tree Friends Diving Spidey Super Stories Tofu Brush Minor Harry Potter Beasts Drawing Baldness Skin Brewery Wood carving Dodge Charger Breastfeeding Amateur telescope making Razor Physical attractiveness Massage Physical characteristics of the Buddha Head Slayers Sperm Whale Hip hop collaborations Vulcan (Star Trek) Upholstery Little Britain Toothbrush Fast bowling Mattress Tattoo Cape Feare Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Wax play Columbine High School massacre 2000 Australian Grand Prix Salute Sin City Internet troll Futurama (TV series - season 3) Alkane Elephant The Adventures of Pete & Pete Tick Beard Drag racing Three Stooges Sundial

l'oreal true match foundation hi i just wanted to know what people's opinion is on l'oreal true match foundation and also if anyone had a foundation they preferred to this one the next question i wanted to ask which has nothing to do with foundation is that i have a top which has a kind of hole in the back and therefore shows the bra bit where it does up i have a bra which has plastic shoulder straps that are see through and so i was wondering if anyone knew of a bra which has a see through back strap of the bra hopefully if it is made of plastic it will not be as noticeable and if anyone has any other ideas of bras i could wear with the top as i am not comfortable with not wearing a bra thankyou and sorry for not making a lot of sense i don't think the halterneck bra would work because you would still see the back of the bra where you do it up thankyou anyway for your help it isn't the straps which are a problem it is the back of the bra where you do it up which you would be able to see because the top has a hole on the back of the top which shows your back i have tried the true match foundation and found it a little too thick for my liking however i liked the powder compact it went on light and gave nice but natural looking coverage i think for the bra it would depend on what kind of opening in the back of the shirt it is have you considered a strapless bra that may work out the best  Brassiere Strap-on dildo Undergarment Shirt Professional wrestling match types Mattress Theory of conduct Social aspects of clothing Snowboard Shoe Jockstrap M16 (rifle) Epistemology Avenue Q Drill bit Floppy disk Knife Glossary of ballet terms Diving suit Plastic Jumpstart 3rd Grade Germaine Greer Black hole Violin Bicycle helmet Snowboarding The Lumberjack Song Compact disc Archery Brewery Hey Jude Equine conformation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Caprice Bourret Dragon Booster Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy Vegeta Textile manufacturing Tiger Woods Debra Marshall Okashina Okashi Motor oil Gramophone record The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Radiohead Menstrual cup Radio Yerevan Buoyancy compensator Donald Davidson (philosopher) Hamster Extreme Programming Datalore (TNG episode) Gurkha Contingent Floorball Kimono Firearm Vacuous truth NASCAR Scientific method Philosophical skepticism Internal ballistics Tenshinhan Time travel Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Tire Corset Conspiracy (TNG episode) Bong De Lorean DMC-12 Expert system Garth Brooks Casualty lifting The Legend of Zelda series enemies Casting The Ashlee Simpson Show Tyra Banks Breastfeeding Ranma __ characters Chair Professional wrestling slang EastEnders John Wycliffe Characters in the Smurfs Time Out of Mind Mary Phelps Jacob Brush Skinhead Langstroth hive Leather WrestleMania XX Volleyball Lost City (Stargate SG-1) Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) The Emancipation of Mimi W.

i wanna change before i go back well its just im soo tired of looking the same way every single day soo boring so i m havin summer holidays from school and i was wondering how i can change my self image a little bit so i can stand out a little bit but how can i do that i dont know i need some really good advice someone who knows their stuff about fashion plz help me and you write your answers in a little detail thnx yoo soo much i will be soooooooo grateful lol i want to look and feel better how can i achieve that how do you gguys pull it off well first of all i'd start with hair bobs are really cute but generally don't work on people with round football styled heads so try the net to discover cuts which will look fab on you i always use this site www ukhairdressrs com you can find the sections about head shapes and which cuts suit if this would help you if your growing your hair lightened waved hair should look good for the end of summer so try using anti firzz serum and wave your hair their are many techniques for doing this depending on your natural hair type of course their are many different things you can do with your hair from poker straight to herringbone braids but it seems it will be a waste of time explaining seen as i don't even know your hair length if your hair is dark brown or slightly black like your avator and you can't afford salon prices i've used lo'real preferences ultra lightening kits before but it's best to test this out on a peice of your hair before when i have my hair cut i usually save a peice lol nails have a fab manicure or paint them a really bright colour like hot pink or orange obviously this depends on your school rules last things you want to do is land yourself in detention first day back make up i think you should just have simple make up and don't cake the foundation on you should show of your tan and a nice bright eye shadow to match your beight nails should draw you some attention at my school we have a uniform same as most places in the uk to look different you could wear a cute fitted blouse with maybe lil bows on the short sleeves oooh yes always short never long far toooo dorky one of those black waist coats that are in fashion may be nice for a windy september or a black vest over your shirt if your slim then definatly wear the clingy trousers with some kitten heels if wearing a skirt the pleated ones are really innocent and girly and don't look anywear near as tacky and slutty as the short clingy ones that make your arse stick out flat lil pumps would make a skirt look complete never heels or points and remember to wear non gloss tights to smooth out your legs complexion teeth i think a nice new hollywood smile would look fab imagine dazzling white teeh try persuading your parents or whoever to buy you bruin orar b pro white electic toothbrush they're half price in england around at the moment you can funk up your uniform by wearing beaded bracelets or cute bangles you could go for the surfer look with the dog tags and brown worn looking beaded bracelets a simple ring with a shimmering diamond fake for school don't forget should catch an eye or too bag get a bag that will show of your personality i don't think many schools have rules about bags just make sure theres room for your books and stuff not forgeting a zip pocket or room for a mini make up bag for all your girly bits such as make up and sanitary towels lol i think the key thing is definatley hair then bag pencil case and shoes these are the main things which people notice but never forget to accesorise if allowed because people will notcie your attention to detail and realise how well groomed you really are have fun shopping and hunt out those bargains in the summer sales good luck with it and enjoy the summer holiday whilst it lasts i know i'll be trying cotton candy pie x p s sorry for any spelling mistakes it was taing all day don't foget a sweet scent and to wax your eyebrows  Skirt and dress Drill bit Black tie Textile manufacturing Customs and etiquette of Japan Violin Japanese tea ceremony Shaggy dog story RuneScape quests Kimono Gothic Lolita Social rule Comanche Skinhead Drawing Undergarment Kodocha Professional wrestling slang Sinfest Aerial (dance move) Blood on the Tracks Haircut Horse Physical attractiveness Suit (clothes) Kilt Billboard Hot 100 The Ashlee Simpson Show Poker jargon Garfield New York Giants Characters of Naruto Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography My Little Pony Microeconomics Textile manufacturing terminology Ocean's Twelve Volleyball Gender role Ed, Edd n Eddy Paul Is Dead Internal ballistics Equine conformation Dog Plastic Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Arsenal F.C.

yearbook picture i have tanned skin light blue eyes and sandy brunette hair i wanna wear a color that would compliment my face the background is dark blue also any make up tips hellpp the blue background should bring out your eyes i would use colors made for blue eyes on your face almay has a site where you can look at specific colors that can either look natural or play up your eyes you don't have to buy the products but it can give you color ideas make sure you don't use a dark eyeliner for your eyes or a dark mascara it can make your eyes look smaller and it would detract from the whole effect you want almay is also a good place to go for lip color or cheek color too http www almay com pg main catcoleyeslips aspx catid catnm eyes subid subnm blue col col no matter what you do i think you'll look great with your tanned skin you might want to try layers with a pinkish shade near your face but a different shade over that so there's not a huge blotch of pink on your photo you could also try a button down shirt with a scarf near your face that makes your eyes seem to sparkle your lipstick should be muted maybe mauve or rose but i would use some clear lipgloss over it to give it a healthy shine  Cosmetics Color Cat coat genetics Physical attractiveness Human skin color Yu-Gi-Oh!

i have a curvy body and a big bum is it bad if i wear shorts im not going to show a picture sorry horndogs wow thanks for all the answers make sure to wear shorts that will cover your bottom generally if you want emphasis away from your bum try wearing bermuda shorts they will give more of an illusion of less shape by making a straight line down over your bottom and down a good portion of your legs don't wear clothing that is tight because that will probably put more emphasis on the parts you don't want emphasis on but don't wear really bulky boyish shorts either that'll look like you're covering up things edit i answered mostly from a fashion perspective but if you don't mind the opinions of others then wear what you want edit contrary to what the person below me thinks skinny girls look best in shorter shorts but it also depends on how long short your legs are i'm tall and uncurvy and bermudas tend to make me look even more like a pole if you wear really small shorts that don't at least give you full coverage in every position possible you'll just be uncomfortable if you want people to look at your underwear then that's fine and if you want to keep emphasis on your bottom wear short shorts i don't care  Undergarment Strap-on dildo Equine conformation Corset Trousers Skirt and dress Buttocks Pantyhose Brassiere Theory of conduct Diving suit Social rule Tightlacing Social aspects of clothing Swimsuit Figure skating History of corsets Diving Aerial (dance move) Mattress Fecal incontinence Fast bowling Japanese tea ceremony Poker jargon American Psycho Punt (boat) The Emancipation of Mimi Jennifer Lopez Marching band Crinoline Glossary of American football Billiards Fielding (cricket) Philosophy of language Fashion A Course In Miracles Casualty lifting View camera Stocking Sauna Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Customs and etiquette of Japan Breaststroke Drill bit Sock Shoe Human height Stairway G-string 1957 World Series Surveillance Marilyn Monroe Discworld Skinhead The Ashlee Simpson Show Human Swimming The nature of God in Western theology Professional wrestling match types Kimono Textile manufacturing Shorts Gravity Dragon Booster Moral Politics Kilt Aikido Tai Chi Chuan Professional wrestling holds Speedo (suit style) Leggings Doug Noam Chomsky Beard Triathlon Dreadlocks Piccolo Junior Saga Philosophy Brewery GED American football strategy Professional wrestling throws Menstrual cup Billboard Hot 100 Softball Current teachings of Prem Rawat Infinity Stereoscopy Human nature Haircut Sail-plan Skiing Breeches Grunge music Shit Sydney Riot of 1879 Draw poker

teeth whitening could someone tell me how much it costs to get your teeth whitened and if it takes more then one visit thank you here is a ballpark cost range for what a dentist might charge for a single professional teeth whitening treatment in some cases more than one treatment might be needed to some dentists feel that their in office bleaching treatments should be followed up with the use of an at home whitener if so you can expect that there will be an additional cost for this additional treatment a patient's costs might lie at the lower end of the price range stated above in those instances where a significant portion of the treatment process is performed by a staff member rather than solely the dentist as another consideration those dentists who incorporate an activation light or laser into the whitening process will have higher equipment costs than those who don't these dentists will need to charge a relatively higher fee for their whitening treatments all whitening products contain peroxide either as carbamide peroxide cp or hydrogen peroxide hp peroxide dissolves the organic stains in the tooth to change the color and produce a whitened effect there are four types of peroxide containing tooth whitening products available in practice products are applied by a dental professional these products contain a high percentage of cp or hp and are applied directly to the teeth some activated by heat light or laser this may be the product for you if you're in a hurry for whiter teeth and you don't have tooth sensitivity for very dark colored teeth the whitening process can be sped up in two to three hours followed by a take home product until the desired whiteness is achieved a take home product supervised by a dentist is the most popular whitening method these products contain a lesser percentage of cp or hp than in practice products and are worn in a tray overnight or during the day at home a custom fitted tray is made to hold the whitening product directly against the teeth while lessening its contact with the gums some products have fluoride added to help prevent or treat mild tooth sensitivities the typical stains of ageing will whiten in seven to fourteen days when the tray is worn overnight over the counter otc whitening products contain a small percentage of hp or cp caution should be used with these products as many contain an acidic solution that can wear away tooth enamel otc products use a bulky one size fits all tray to hold the product usually more product is swallowed than stays in the tray because of the trays poor fit against the teeth it can take up to six months and the purchase of several kits to get whiter teeth flexible strips coated with whitening gel have recently been introduced as an otc at home tooth whitening method the strips are worn on the front teeth and folded over to keep them in place results are reported to be noticeable after fourteen days and effective for months over the counter whitening toothpastes contain a small percentage of hp cp or polishing ingredient the toothpastes are effective in keeping teeth cleaner and whiter looking but some may be very abrasive the harsh abrasive will wear away the enamel with repeated use gradually making the teeth look yellow whitening toothpastes remove surface stains and prevent new stains from building up whitening toothpastes however aren't in contact with the teeth long enough to remove internal stains ask your dentist about the safety and cavity protection of specific toothpastes before you buy you may wish to read a

i have a question about nails i have recently stopped biting my nails and i don't know how i shoudl shape them do you think rounded or squared nails look better square shaped rounded nails make your fingers appear stubbier thicker and shorter but they are also easier to do things with l a square tip will elongate your fingers and make them appear a bit thinner i think it also looks much nice as if you take good care of yourself oh and if you let your nails grow and you make them square they will look like you got them done a nail shop but instead of having fake nails your will be real and if you wear rings or bracelets a square shaped nails look much better to have to help you achieve that square look after you cut them with a clipper file them straight down to get a straight line so use a nail filer to p s do not bite your nails anymore ok it makes them very weak and it takes time for them to grow healthy and strong use a nail strengthner like sally hansen for now  Nail (anatomy) Manicure Violin Drill bit Knife Screw Textile manufacturing Leaf Strap-on dildo Hair Saxophone Nail (engineering) Equine conformation Wood Upholstery Diamond Pedicure Tire Woodworking Volleyball Harmonica Chess strategy and tactics Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Clarinet Trent Reznor Snooker Blood (computer game) Nine Inch Nails RuneScape skills Milton H.

smokey eyes i'm a yr old freshman and i was wondering if that's too young to do the smokey eye i reeally love it and i think it looks great but my friend said it was too much is it i'm a year old freshman too well normally i would say go natural but if you really want to here first use brown soft color eyeliner and start lining your eye don't be too harsh because the next step is smudging it with a sponge or q tip then you brush your eye crease with some coffee eye shadow do the lower lash line too okay do it lightly go for a more softer smokey eye it'll look great  The Miracles Cosmetics Smokey Robinson Coffee Drawing Diamond R.E.M.

best eye color i think these are beautiful eyes plus the kitty is uber cute http www flickr com photos rekha http www flickr com photos diezelphotography http www flickr com photos minhavidadegata http www flickr com photos jon e i think the cat's eyes are the prettiest p actually the reason all those eye colors look so great is because of the quality of the camera it may also be due to retouching but i'm not sure if these photos were retouched or not most anyone can be shot by a good photography with a high quality camera and film and their eyes will look magnificent oh and i'm glad that you included a multitude of eye colors brown eyes don't get recognized much as being a nice eye color just because they're common they can still be beautiful so i'm glad you included the little girl with brown eyes  Photography Butterfly Stereoscopy Digital photography Flickr London Rafflesia Cinematography Cover girl Ajax (programming) W.I.T.C.H.

what to do about nails which are damanged from artifical nails how to get them healthy i have been using artifical nails because mine look so bad really tired of having to buy them and worry about them coming off please tell me a product that really helps i am unsure if you are just buying the fake nails at a beauty supply store or if you are getting them done at a salon if you do them yourself in order to remove them you have to soak them in acetone nailpolish remover that says it will take off fake nails then with an oragne stick gently push them off your real nail if you got them done at a salon you can do the same thing but i would suggest going back to have them removed take a few tylenol as it hurts when they break the acrylic off your natural nail when i had acrylics i kept my nails painted for the first couple of months because they looked really nasty just rough and discolored then after a month of so i just kept my nails short the natural nail is now brittle from the use of fake nails and buffed them once every few weeks take a good vitamin and get plenty of calcium and in a few months your natural nails will grow out and should be ok once the damaged nail has grown out you can re grow your nails to a natural length if you keep a good coat of clear polish on them it will help them from breaking best of luck  Manicure Nail (anatomy) Acetone Textile manufacturing Plastic Breastfeeding Nine Inch Nails Leather Horseshoe Tire Knife Milk Drill bit Humphrey Bogart 2000 Australian Grand Prix Lacquer Tooth enamel Pedicure Gesso 1957 World Series Tattoo Trish Stratus Organic food Piccolo Junior Saga Shroud of Turin Rice Soy milk Guinea pig Carpal tunnel syndrome Psoriasis NWo Domestic rabbit Nutrition Theory of conduct Marilyn Monroe Jam (TV series) Bone fracture Wound Deflation (economics) Prostate cancer Chicken Joy Electric Polymethyl methacrylate Apple Shaggy dog story Mattress Stomach cancer Ocean's Twelve Second Battle of the Atlantic Neighbours Tooth Heinkel He 112 Vitamin Green Day Casting Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Iron EastEnders The Passion of the Christ Solvent RuneScape skills Fake etymology Tofu Karl Rove Fractal Vlad III Dracula The Young Ones (TV series) Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Kitsch Vitamin D Jennifer Lopez Clown Bong Coeliac disease Fast bowling USS Vestal (AR-4) Meat Loaf Calcium Blood (computer game) Tocopherol Upholstery Nail (engineering) Woodworking Paul Levesque Hurt (song) The Rutles Tenshinhan Milton H.

how can i train my man to look after himself better my man is the complete opposite to me i take lots of pride in my appearance and there's rarely a hair out of place on me lol my guy on the other hand doesn't care what he looks like he has acne which he cannot be bothered to treat by improving his diet or doing to a doctor and often he doesn't shave or iron his clothes i feel a bit embarrassed as i always look immaculate how can i train him into becoming a well groomed man first acne can be difficult to take care of for anyone there is no single cure for acne when i was a teen with acne i finally found that regular bar soap and shampoo lather worked well on my face without causing undesired dryness or flaky skin but this won't work for everyone second as for not shaving his face often if you want him to do it more often be sure to tell him in a nice way say somewhat jokingly that you refuse to kiss him until he shaves for example you might also try buying him a new razor such as the more expensive and fancy type of blade razor or even an electric razor electric razors are very popular gifts at christmas time for example it's possible he is just lazy about shaving but his acne might make shaving a bit difficult however keeping his face shaved might help to improve the acne problem if you want him to get a haircut try offering to take him to a barber shop together or a hair stylist for men as for non ironed clothes that is pretty normal for guys i only use a flat iron about twice a year if the clothes are stored so they will not get wrinkled after being laundered that can go a long way to reducing wrinkled clothes you guy might need some help learning how to care for his clean clothes such as which items to hang and which items to fold and how to fold to avoid wrinkles if his clothes need to be replaced try taking him shopping for clothing this way you can pick out some things you think he will look good wearing he probably doesn't really care one way or another based on what you wrote if you help select the clothes that look better and fit better you can both be happier some men simply don't know how to go about making themselves look better if their father or other family members were sloppy then that may be all they know lastly don't forget to encourage him to keep his teeth in good condition not brushing his teeth will be costly later in life use suggestions to get your guy to improve say things in nice joking ways perhaps screaming and making demands may not be helpful at all  Shaving Social rule Razor Textile manufacturing Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psoriasis Sento Haircut Clothing Barber Fecal incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Androgen insensitivity syndrome Professional wrestling match types Characters in the Smurfs Urinary incontinence The Apprentice 2 Japanese tea ceremony Global Gillette Upholstery Stomach cancer Domestic rabbit Avenue Q Tooth Friends Skinhead About a Boy Beard Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Strap-on dildo Humphrey Bogart Drill bit Customs and etiquette of Japan Fancy rat Animal Crossing 613 mitzvot Baldness Gas metal arc welding Happy Tree Friends Theory of conduct Shampoo The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Jam (TV series) Kodocha 2000 Australian Grand Prix Kimono Marilyn Monroe Eczema Pubic hair Hair Dog training Kurt Angle Equine conformation W.I.T.C.H.

do i have a shot at modeling i want it so bad http i photobucket com albums x summern summer jpg http i photobucket com albums x summern summer jpg i'm getting my braces off modeling is a very hard career to get yourself into they want people that look like sticks these days you are beautiful i would definitely think you have a chance just know that you are beautiful in general and because one agency doesn't think you are that doesn't mean that another one won't think the exact opposite so my advice is don't get your hopes up for any big agencies because they want twigs as models and you are beautiful dont ever think you are different and definitely do not think you are overweight or fat because you have a perfect body so do not do any crash dieting i do think you have a very good getting hired though just start small and hopefully someday you will become big best wishes  Bon Jovi Jennifer Lopez Jon Secada Girls Aloud Drill bit Bad Religion Peter Shilton Obesity Recurring South Park characters Atomic Kitten The Notorious B.I.G.

are there any quality nail polish brands other than opi i always keep my toenails painted in opi nail polish because they are known as the highest quality but they don't have all the colors i want and the bottles are quite expensive are there any brands out there of similar quality that are less expensive or that come in more unique colors revlon is one of the best in the industry it stays on a long time and holds a good shine if you want unique colors use acrylic paint and an artists brush to decorate your nails first put a base coat on then paint your design on and finish with a top coat use revlon base and top coat for this don't use different brands of base and top coats the producers make their products work together so changing brands with base and top coats will cause it to chip more  Cosmetics Manicure Brush Lacquer Paint Nail (anatomy) Colours, standards and guidons Knife Pottery Stucco Plastic Light-emitting diode Epoxy Casting Drill bit Carpet Bong Mattress Drawing Wood carving Leica John Opie Art Heraldry Nail (engineering) Traditional animation Upholstery Totem pole Shoe polish Brewery Rum Chocolate Titanium Photography Binoculars Nine Inch Nails Brand Billiards Wassily Kandinsky Vitreous enamel Textile manufacturing terminology Sunglasses Vanilla Ninja Diamond Oreo Szlachta Woodworking Drew Struzan Glass Glaze Polymethyl methacrylate ATI Technologies Dodge Charger Logo Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Pump It Up Chewing gum Shroud of Turin Painter and decorator Trademark Fluorescent lamp Photographic film Impressionism Paintball Laser engraving Buick Skylark Scotch whisky Crayola Lionel Corporation Poker jargon Friction Paper marbling Commodity Printmaking Acrylic paint IMac Beer Lamborghini Diablo AMD Sea-Monkey Konica Minolta Hemp Rail tracks Mirror Architecture of the California missions Neopets Painting Andrea Mantegna Textile manufacturing Leather Piet Mondrian Stanton Macdonald-Wright Netsuke W__adys__aw Reymont Daewoo Vincent van Gogh Amateur telescope making Ford Motor Company Diamond cut

haircut and highlights best answer pts i have really dark brown hair here is a pic of what it looks like http tinypic com view php pic fnr h i'm getting a haircut tomorrow what kind should i get and i want highlights what color should i get and can you send me a link of what color you have in mind thanks i dont think you should cut it in lenght because i seriously regret cutting my hair maybe ask your hairdresser to give you some layers that would be nice the side bangs are very nice too for the highlights i strongly advise you not to get red because it turns out like rust color after a while or if you absolutely want to get highlights there are some hair dye things that are only for virgin hair and you can use it without bleaching your hair there is less damage done so yea kk hope this helped maybe just a slightly lighter brown than what you have to make it look the most natural possible someting like this but lighter http www istockphoto com file thumbview approve istockphoto brown hair girl jpg if i were you i wouldnt to highlights because it ruins the texture of your hair but eehh its your decision  Haircut Hair color Hair coloring Hair HyperText Transfer Protocol Dragon Booster Emo fashion Barbie Kimono Color Human skin color Death rock fashion Drawing Color theory Physical attractiveness W.I.T.C.H.

how is it looked upon when a guy uses colored contacts i was using colored contacts sometime ago just for fun to see how my look changes with a different eye color i got really mixed reactions from people forget getting to how i look but most people were shocked and gave freaked up reactions just to find that i was using colored contacts my personal opinion was it did not look totally crazy and of course i chose a color which went with my skin but i really enjoyed wearing them but i just want to know how is it looked upon in general and if its ok if a guy uses such things just be yourself if you want to wear them then wear them if you are asking for personal opinions then i would think it was unusual maybe strange i honestly don't think i have ever seen a man wear colored contacts question is do you want to be different and not affraid to be an individual answer that question for yourself and then make your decision good luck  Social rule Theory of conduct The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Sub-Zero The nature of God in Western theology Tattoo Eye contact The Ashlee Simpson Show Shaggy dog story Spontaneous human combustion Plame affair Dualism (philosophy of mind) Dragons (Pern) Black Sexual orientation Dragon Booster Aesthetic Realism Sunglasses Joke The Emancipation of Mimi The Apprentice 2 Black (people) Scientology beliefs and practices Humphrey Bogart Social psychology Sharon Tate Avenue Q Phoebe Buffay's songs Good Morning, Vietnam Equal Protection Clause Autism President (game) Game show Culture shock Consensus decision-making The Amazing Race Buddy Guy Joker (comics) White (people) Meaning of life Paul Is Dead New York Giants Altruism Color Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Abduction Phenomenon Opportunity rover Subud Eye color Samuel Alito Martial art Kimi Finster Rei Ayanami Invader Zim Sulfuric acid Physical attractiveness Statistical survey Nick Berg Contact lens Little Britain Clarence Thomas I Am the Walrus Combat stress reaction 613 mitzvot Human skin color God Emperor of Dune Cosmetics The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Allergy Rich Mullins Hair color Camp Lazlo Lamanite Time Out of Mind Paul W.

i have never had my eyebrows waxed at a salon before help i have some questions i know its not really a big deal but i had a few questions about it i checked a few salons websites and they all say just eyebrow waxing this is the same thing as eyebrow shaping right ware they pluck wax the eyebrows so they look good lol also about how long does it take could anybody give me a walk though of the whole procedure like from the sit down point to the point ware you go pay for it from my experience the people in the salon ask you to sit in a chair with something behind you to rest your head upon or they have a reclining chair or table they ask you what your preference is to clean up or shape ie to remove stray hairs or the dreaded unibrow or to thin your eyebrows then the stylist dips a wooden stick thinner than a popsicle stick into a vat of hot wax removes it blows on it to make sure it's not too hot and puts it on the hair to be removed next the stylist will put wax paper over the wax you will feel a lot of pressing and rubbing so that the paper sticks to all the wax and the wax sticks to the hair the stylist then pulls the paper wax and hair in one fell swoop it may hurt for just a second but it's not bad this process is repeated until all of the unwanted hair is removed after all the hair is grossly removed ie no real detail work the stylist will pluck finely remove any hairs that are too short for the wax to get that's the part that gets me the most the waxing is fine always make sure that you complain if the wax is too hot surface burns can occur if it's too hot the stylist will show you a mirror and you can ensure that you like the work before you sit up and pay since it's the eyebrows and not a mustache like mine it's not that bad you'll be glad when you're done because you will look more beautiful than you already are don't forget to tip  Casting Manicure Pottery Dreadlocks Textile manufacturing Japanese tea ceremony Brewery Internal ballistics Cross-country skiing Double bass Violin Drill bit Gilding Knife Aerial (dance move) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Repouss__ and chasing Motor oil Shaggy dog story Poker jargon Baldness Milton H.

girls only ok ive been shaving down thier and i was wondering if anyone has any good ideas on how to get it too stay sheved for a long time of to get rid of hair i know what you're going through i've experienced the exact same thing shaving really doesn't work at all down there for me it leaves stubbles irritation and it's just horrible waxing is the answer to your problem it's long term and makes it super smooth go to target and get a waxing kit here is an example of one http www folica com gigi brazilian d html if you don't want to do it yourself then go to a pro waxer whatever you do don't use cheap hair removers like veet nair i used nair down there it got extremely red burned itched and was raw for days some other options people have done are getting a very good razor and using conditioner and a really good shaving cream for sensitive skin also i've heard of people plucking down there which would hurt like hell after you're done waxing or shaving if that's what you choose to do then put some aloe vera on there to sooth any irritation you may have experienced and also you can put a soothing lotion on it i'd suggest waxing yourself or getting it down by a pro if you go to a pro they can either give you a brazillian wax which removes all the hair or a bikini wax which just removes the sides also known as a landing strip good luck honey amber  Pubic hair Depilation Shaving Waxing Aloe Psoriasis Beard Baldness Brazilian waxing Leg shaving Razor Eczema Guinea pig Haircut Head shaving Social rule Dilbert 613 mitzvot Wax play Hair Laser hair removal Theory of conduct The Adventures of Pete & Pete The Amber Spyglass Professional wrestling match types Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Kurt Angle Pysanka Honey Lenny Leonard Leather Skinhead Pseudofolliculitis barbae Late Night with Conan O'Brien Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Top-bar hive Acne Global Gillette Ice cream Kodocha Piccolo Junior Saga Androgen insensitivity syndrome Calvin and Hobbes Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Joe Namath Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Coffee Conjunctivitis Recess (TV series) Marilyn Monroe World Wide Web Manicure Perfume Mummy Pitaten Ren and Stimpy Shampoo GunBound Dandruff Joke Oh My Goddess!

what age is it okay to get rid of the hair down there not like a wax but shaving and stuff serious answers please when did you if you wanna share that i know i'm going to probably get slammed for saying this but you asked for opinions there really isn't a good reason for teenagers to shave their pubic area and i would be highly angered if i found out my teenager had been doing it there shouldn't be anyone down there that one would have to try and impress someone with shaved out designs or to give easier access to it's just a kind of slutty thing to do pubic hair is one of the many ways that mother nature signals to men that a female has reached puberty and is ready for mating breeding by shaving off this hair a female is mimicking the pre pubescent body form it would make a really interesting research project to try and correlate the rise of pubic shaving rising in the s s with the decline of status for the mature female or any rises in child molestation pedophilia if you have to say hair down there instead of pubic hair then you re most likely still too immature and don t really need to worry about it no one every mentions the downsides of pubic hair removal extreme itching when it grows back do you really want people to see you with your hand down your pants and itching your pubes like mad for a week you often break out in small little pimples due to the removal of the hair shaft from sebaceous glands and build up of oils and sweats and shaving is more likely to give you painful ingrown hairs where the hair gets stuck beneath the skin as it grows back and forms an ugly nasty pimple looking thing that can cause scarring if you re of a lighter complexion on top of all of these nasty things shaving is only good for a few hours to a day and a half before the hair starts to grow back in and you re scratching away at your privates like a monkey at the zoo at heck even girls are too young to be worried about shaving away all of their pubic hair i guess i can see how this new hair can be viewed as being sick and gross by young girls but they should really take pride in their developing bodies if you need to do something for purely hygienic reasons try trimming with scissors just be sure you don t get too close to the skin you risk cutting yourself  Puberty Hair Depilation Androgen insensitivity syndrome Acne Crab louse Vulva Baldness Pedophilia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Thermoregulation Haircut Shaving Beard Kodocha Social rule Delayed puberty Adolescence Sento Cat Tarantula Skin Female genital cutting Prostate cancer Penis Menstrual cup Child sexuality Pseudofolliculitis barbae Adrenarche Phoebe Buffay's songs Waxing Skinhead Dandruff Comanche Radiation therapy Dilbert Sebaceous gland Physical attractiveness Theory of conduct Friends Guinea pig Head louse Gray Wolf AFI 100 Years series Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Piccolo Junior Saga Hypertrichosis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kender Teen Girl Squad Professional wrestling match types Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dragon Booster 613 mitzvot Megan Griffin Menstrual cycle Humphrey Bogart Black (people) Wound healing phases The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Eczema Ren and Stimpy House Mouse Sperm Whale Pornography Scar Pitaten Avenue Q Aqua Teen Hunger Force Acomoclitism Law of value Anorexia nervosa Dog Asperger syndrome Kim Possible Sweating Testosterone Platypus Callus Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Herpes simplex virus Jon Secada The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Baldness treatments Ron and Fez Mountain Gorilla Scarification Sexual orientation Human Circumcision

do most graphic design art related jobs allow visible piercings tattoos dressing creatively this may seem like a silly question but how is a person supposed to express their creative energy and abilities if they're confined to a suit and tie are most jobs casual in that field well it's hard to say that all jobs require a suit and a tie and vice versa most graphic designers freelancs or they are self employed so they dress however they want to if you are work for a company then it depends on what company you work for how big the company is and your position for example if you work for pepsi or some other huge company in nyc then it's obvious you should dress in appropriate dress pants and shirt also if you are a senior graphic designer then you obviously do not want to go to your office looking like a clown also if you work for children's books toys etc then i suppose you can be creative with your looks since the environment in that company wouldn't be the same as in a pepsi company so it all depends on a number of things i guess the creativity you lose from your looks you can add to your work  Computer IPod Game programmer Social aspects of clothing Trademark The Apprentice 2 Suit (clothes) Undergarment Bob Jones University Intellectual property Mac OS X Sento Apple Macintosh Bicycle The Sims Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Jackass: The Movie Spidey Super Stories Art Margin of error Amiga American football strategy Black tie Jesuit College Preparatory School Professor Cowboy ITunes Music Store Graphic design Apple Computer Password Beavis and Butt-head Iron Man Academia Explosive material Pixar Steve Jobs Cheating in Counter-Strike Construction User Friendly Will Eisner ISO 9000 Tattoo Theory of conduct Modern Age of Comic Books Hip hop rivalries IBM Creative industries Piccolo Junior Saga SpongeBob SquarePants Management Culture of the United States Space suit Florida Central Voter File Drama Patent IBM PC compatible School uniform Extreme Programming W.

why do girls model themselves after trashy women why do young girls model themselves after people like paris hilton and lindsay lohan more specifically what is it that's attractive about them i personally wouldn't want to model myself after someone in rehab for cocaine or arrested for a dui they're also too skinny and not cute without makeup so what's so great about them there's nothing great or admirable about them but unfortunately the media repeatedly portray good girls as boring or laughable and bad girls as fun loving and desirable therefore it is easy for young girls to want to imitate those rotten and annoying girls who are shown living an exciting and extravagant lifestyle the same thing goes for the boys boys who should be admired for being smart responsible and good students are depicted as nerds unattractive and undesirable while the bad boys are depicted as charming funny and desirable the cool guys who get all the pretty girls this is why parents have to spend more time setting a good example and teaching their sons and daughters real values human decency instead of repeating the phrase family values without really knowing the true meaning of it  Lindsay Lohan Humphrey Bogart Garfield One Tree Hill (TV series) Paris Hilton Friends Otaku The Fairly OddParents Undergrads The Young Ones (TV series) About a Boy Viz (comic) Physical attractiveness The Beach Boys Beavis and Butt-head Sex and the City Great Teacher Onizuka Cliff Richard Family Matters (TV series) Adolescence Lewis Carroll Totally Spies!

what's the secret to making a fragrance last all day as far as keeping it fresh w o reapplying or having an overly musky scent you need to apply the perfume to different areas of the body based on blood flow to that area you smell the fragrance as it evaporates so if you put it on an area like the chest or neck where there is more blood flow it will evaporate more quickly than if you put it on the wrists or ankles where there is much less blood flow  Perfume Odor Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling throws Olfaction Evaporation Suplex Diving suit Pressure point Guerlain Aerial (dance move) Physical examination Aroma compound Menstrual cycle Britney Spears Angel One (TNG episode) Anatomical terms of location Myocardial infarction Human anatomy Lung Lake Weight training Aromatherapy Paris Hilton Water Drowning Skin Physical attractiveness Dialysis Water resources Orange (fruit) Chokehold Sweating Pneumonia Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Musk Blood pressure Traumatic brain injury Multiple chemical sensitivity Incense Bondage (BDSM) Lake Eyre Basin Medicine Casualty lifting Hogtie bondage Rose Intravenous therapy Equine conformation Blood First aid The Inside Local anesthesia Insulin Dairy Common cold Pulse Breast bondage Korban Dinosaur River Yarrow Physical characteristics of the Buddha Angina Wound Anointing Autopsy Rei Ayanami Soap Deodorant Naruto jutsu Table tennis Kimono Sage Tai Chi Chuan Hannibal Lecter Massage Suicide methods Snowboarding Strange Fruit Turner syndrome Conan the Barbarian Blood alcohol content Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Essential oil Vomiting Stigmata Hyperthermia Professional wrestling aerial techniques Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Thermoregulation Aloe Cat L'Or__al Blood vessel Niddah Blushing Suspension bondage Punch (strike) Aquifer Edible salt

first day of high school help what am i supposed to expect i'm starting high school in exactly a week and i need help i'm kinda nervous can you give me some advice on how to act and what to do please don't be scared it's just school and even though you're in high school now it's still just school granted the oldest people on the campus are legal adults but that's besides the point remember being a sixth grader going into middle school and all of the eighth graders especially the boys looked so big and scary but when you became an eighth grader you realized they weren't big at all it's kind of like that more than anything be nice upperclassmen are full of themselves and they'll hate you for no other reason than you're a freshman i just graduated high school and i made a vow in sophomore year to never be rude to freshmen just beause they're freshmen then i realized that freshmen can be really obnoxious so i hated them for that instead of just for the fact that they're freshmen but here's the thing if you're nice upperclassmen are more likely to accept you if you're loud and obnoxious and do stupid stuff upperclassmen are likely to f ing hate you just be sweet and smile a lot everyone likes a cute little freshman girl that smiles a lot good luck you'll do great  The Citadel (Military College) Recurring South Park characters Education in the United States 2000 Australian Grand Prix Shaggy dog story Rich Mullins Social rule Kim Possible Case Western Reserve University Student New Trier High School Georgia Institute of Technology Little Britain The Emancipation of Mimi Sin City Avenue Q Cliff Richard The Fairly OddParents Azumanga Daioh Garfield Humphrey Bogart Stuyvesant High School The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Blood on the Tracks Duke University Texas A&M University Corps of Cadets FoxTrot Empire Burlesque Okashina Okashi Brown University The Beach Boys Theory of conduct Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Pennsylvania State University Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Girly Urusei Yatsura Virginia Military Institute Princeton University Hall & Oates Rocko's Modern Life Ranma __ characters Ron Weasley South Park Shawn Michaels Kelly Clarkson Codename: Kids Next Door Quizbowl Characters in the Smurfs Jesuit College Preparatory School Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Phillips Exeter Academy University of Pennsylvania Ron and Fez Full Metal Panic?

oily t zone please help after i put on my moisterizer which is oil free and suppose to stop shine i use an oil free foundation but an hr later my t zone is always shiny i have to keep putting on either a loose or transulent powder on my face any tips or ideas please help oh yea and i dont have acne just blemishes from when i used to have it and i picked it your skin is producing oil because it is dehydrated it sounds crazy but it's true i used to have really oily skin until i started moisturizing and hydrating like crazy hydrating your skin is different from moisturizing you should start by exfoliating your skin at least times a week with a good scrub what i mean by a good scrub is that the little bits in the scrub should be a substantial size and hard don't use those face washes with the little beads in it as your exfoliater they are fine as a wash but they are not effective enough as an exfoliator next you want to hydrate at least times a week dermalogica also makes a wonderful hydrating mask it's a clear gel mask and it plumps up the top layers of your skin next is moisture definetly an oil free moisturizer is best when your skin dehydrated it secreets oil to try and hydrate it but all it does is make it greasy you'll notice your skin will be a lot more matte after about a week don't use any of those lotions that say they stop the shine all they do is dry out those top layers of your skin and make the problem worse hope this helps try the dermalogica brand because most of their products are made for oily or acne prone skin it's really a great product  Acne Psoriasis Manicure Soap Cosmetics Shaving Skin Portland cement Shampoo Sulfuric acid Eczema Chocolate Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Drill bit Dehydration Diving suit Instant coffee Wood Rice Jute Aloe Hemp Cleanser Fire extinguisher Mummy Knife Weathering Glycerin The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Turquoise Thermal power station Methamphetamine Woodworking Sento The Legend of Zelda series enemies Glass Concrete Dry cleaning Upholstery Urticaria Marathon (sport) Tattoo Scar Town gas Explosive material Weather lore Hair Alcohol fuel Water Wok Smegma Leather Dialysis Rosacea Sunburn Scarification Embalming Plastic USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) Social rule MP3 Puberty Hard disk Androgen insensitivity syndrome Laundry detergent Transformer Oily fish Cheese Mattress Keratosis pilaris 1957 World Series Zeolite Desert Testosterone Adrenarche Corrosion Urinary incontinence Brewery Diaper Sebaceous gland TLC Chemical warfare Alternative fuel Procter & Gamble Lionel Corporation Treehouse of Horror V Equine conformation Physical attractiveness Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Nintendo Entertainment System Cleveland Browns Clown Dairy Phenol

what can you do to remove the yellow stain on ur nails after wearing nail polish for too long if it has been a long time it may not come off try soaking your hands in lemon juice and water with a little hand soap and maybe file the nail on a regular basis to eventually remove the yellow staining from the nail try not to wear darker colors on the nails and if you must wear dark colors try to put clear under the color and don't wear it for an extended period of time  Tooth enamel Upholstery Nail (anatomy) Tattoo Niddah Nine Inch Nails Textile manufacturing Rum Bong Mattress Paul Is Dead Pedicure Beer Diamond enhancement Mango Laundry detergent Yellow Contact lens Lemon Menstrual cup Wassily Kandinsky Sulfur Staining (biology) Sunglasses Melanin Shroud of Turin Woodworking Green Lantern Black Wedding ring Drill bit Laser hair removal Henna Green Day The Truman Show Collectibles in Bionicle Colours, standards and guidons Wound Salad Fingers Color theory Escherichia coli O157:H7 Blue Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Time Out of Mind Irish dance Ammolite Malignant melanoma Lemonade Aes Sedai Leather Vinegar Tequila Laundry Wood Arsenal F.C.

just outta curiousity ok girls why do u keep asking 'guys what do u like in a girl' what u gonna do tally up your answers and decide 'ok from now on im going to try and be pretty with blue eyes and big boobs and skinny' im just wondering cuz a lotta the girls ask that and i really dont see the where they are heading with it so yeah explain pls they are insecure and feel that they need to be a certain way for a man to find them attractive i'm assuming that many of these girls that ask these questions are young what they need to understand is that all men are different and don't all like the same thing one man may be attracted to brunettes where as another man may be attracted to blondes some men may like thin women some may like curvy women men should not all be placed in the same category when it comes to preferences they are all different just like all women are different they need to understand that if they have to change they way that they look for any man then they have no respect for themself because a man should like you for who you are if you change for a man it just shows that you have low self esteem and no confidence which by the way from many studies and polls most men prefer a woman that has confidence in herself rather than the one that continuously wants to change themself to please others i hope that kind of explains some things and also opens up the eyes of some of the girls that ask that question that will read this answer  Sexual orientation Jon Secada Blonde on Blonde AFI 100 Years series The Ashlee Simpson Show Joke Kender The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Social rule Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Jennifer Lopez Humphrey Bogart Milton H.

how can i get a tan faster really well moisturised skin takes less time to tan and will take a tan far easier and more evenly so use loads of moisturiser for a few weeks in preparation for your holiday in the sun or whatever but trying to tan too fast by sitting out in the sun for long periods is very foolish there have been surveys which prove that two people who sunbathed for different times one long and one short ultimately ended up with the same depth of tan at the end of the three week trial but the person who had sat in the sun for long periods had burned peeled and generally been very uncomfortable whereas the person who sat in the sun for shorter periods had acquired their tan safely evenly and with no problems lastly the very fastest way to tan is air brushing or a fake tan  Sunlight The End of the World (Doctor Who) Comanche Trajectory Sun tanning Diving suit Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Sunscreen Kepler's laws of planetary motion Tai Chi Chuan USS Alfred A.

why are there so many little girls and boys on here asking if people think they're cute do they all have self esteem issues or something and why do they think that a bunch of stangers telling them what they think will make it all better weird beauty is so subjective and when you are young you are trying to figure who you are i don't think all cases are issues of self esteem it is a bit odd that some people would trust us strangers more than people they know yet we have no specific reason to lie to them we are not trying to prove we are better than them by telling them they are ugly and we are not trying to build up their confidence because we are their friend so maybe we can provide an impartial and helpful sounding board for them one that won't accidentally tell someone at their school what they wondering  Situation comedy Social rule Friends "Weird Al" Yankovic Teen Girl Squad Otaku Code: Lyoko Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus W.I.T.C.H.

cute bangs fringe i had side bangs but i grew them out they are not as long as my hair they are about to my chin on one side and to my ear on the other my hair is about and inch past my shoulders what are cute bangs fringe that i should get pictures would be fab thanks a bunch answer with most pictures gets the points it's your face shape and features that should dictate the cut of your hair not the other way round get a cut that highlights beautiful eyes wispy side parted eye length bangs or the shapely line of a gorgeous jaw long bangs that follow the line or dramatizes great cheekbones bangs that go above or below and follow the line there's little more tragic than someone who brings a picture into a salon and insists they want that cut which turns out to look great on the model but dreadful on them i've seen girls burst into tears upon getting exactly the cut they insisted on especially when the stylist tried to talk them out of it in the first place  Haircut Beard Professional wrestling throws Physical attractiveness W.I.T.C.H.

hiding belly button piercing im having a family get together pool party and no one knows i have this piercing is there any way to hide it are the clear belly button rings or retainers good enough the easiest way out is to just say you feel sick to your stomach and don't feel like swimming then wear your regular clothes all day don't pretend too much or act too sick that they end up wanting to take you to the doctor or anything just make a little pouty face and hold your stomach once in awhile that should do the trick as for a clear one i'm sure someone would still notice just because it's clear doesn't mean it's invisible especially if sun gleams off it or something or you could use fyouimatwirp's suggestion and use the sterilized fishing line when my sister got hers pierced they told her not to take it out for any reason for at least months but if she really really had to take it out like for an xray or something to put a piece of fishing line through it somebody might notice though and that's going to look even weirder than if you just had the ring in lol in the water it would be invisible though so just stay in the water as much as possible and when you get out hold your arm or your towel over it then run to the bathroom to get changed saying you're cold or something if all else fails and they want to make you go swimming just hold your arm across your stomach or something one piece bathing suits might work but they might still see the little bump from the ring they might also get suspicious if you don't normally wear one pieces same goes for t shirts not white when wet it will be basically clear and they'll see it so pick blue or black or something you can just say you don't want to get sunburned but if you never normally wear shirts while swimming someone might get suspicious if at all possible just take it out right before you put on the bathing suit and then put it back in right away after you get out probably shouldn't try that if it's been less than two or three months but even then someone might notice the holes if they look close enough good luck ps they're gonna find out someday though it's kind of inevitable so start planning now what you're gonna say juuuust in case  Aerial (dance move) Sento Drowning Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Poker jargon Diving suit Diving The Shining (film) Social rule Swimming pool Sauna Bathing My Life as a Teenage Robot Friends Swimsuit Combine (Half-Life 2) YuYu Hakusho Professional wrestling throws Earring Happy Tree Friends The Amber Spyglass Body piercing RuneScape quests Invisibility Shirt Social aspects of clothing Comanche Blood Simple Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Ring Treehouse of Horror XV Upholstery Computer virus One Piece minor characters Tag Baroque chess Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Theory of conduct Saruman Characters of Naruto 2000 Australian Grand Prix Mercury Atlas 6 Archery The Hobbit Knots Landing Menstrual cup Slow Train Coming Strap-on dildo Akatsuki (Naruto) Time Out of Mind Hyperthermia Jackass: The Movie Sharon Tate Professional wrestling holds Animal Crossing Nudism Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Shaggy dog story Mattress Chess strategy and tactics Characters in the Smurfs Professional wrestling match types Sea-Monkey Midnight Run Sheepshead Textile manufacturing Headgear Common cold Clothing Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Dragon Booster Towel Fecal incontinence Jon Secada Paul Is Dead Conspiracy (TNG episode) Characters of Lost The Ashlee Simpson Show Suplex Breaststroke Mario Suit (clothes) Team Fortress Classic Beachwear Clown EastEnders Frankie Laine James Hanratty Hamster

modelling i wanna be a model do i have to pay to get in a portfolio modeling is over rated my daughter is ' and has been modeling for the last couple of years she is also going to college the modeling industry is not a good one unless you feel comfortable with undressing in the nude with others watching you can expect that if you do runway my daughter chose to do bridal runway shows and even when she had her own room it really made her wonder to start off you have to have a professional photo shoot then create comp and face cards and then locate an agent that knows what they're doing many of the agency's are not as they claim they get at leat of all your earnings you do the work and they get the profits by the time anyone gets a first look it can be in the thousands and that is not including any job another thing to think about is the fact that once your face is out there you can have stalkers as my daughter did who was able to locate her it is not a safe career for a young woman to be in and i would advise you have a body guard if your serious about it way too much trouble please think it over well  Modelling agency America's Next Top Model Economic inequality Striptease Model (art) Blue Heelers Sin City EastEnders Nudity Friends Economics Page Falkenberg Trish Stratus Insurance National Football League Credit card Blackjack On Her Majesty's Secret Service The Devil Wears Prada Citigroup The Apprentice 2 candidates God Emperor of Dune Bond Internet fraud Apple Computer GoldenEye 007 Life insurance Principal-agent problem Jam (TV series) Progressive tax Barbie The Critic Tyra Banks Montgomery Burns Airline Spice Girls Lewis Carroll Computer and video game industry Boris Becker Labor theory of value Eddie Guerrero Haven (TNG episode) The Shining (film) Minimum wage United Kingdom corporation tax Brian Jones (musician) Humphrey Bogart Swimming pool Sharon Tate Trade union Student loan G-Man (Half-Life) Graduate school Fred A.

have a new look worry about going back to school last year i was know as the rocker punk girl whatever you want to call it but now i have new look it's more colorful and more scene whatever you would call my style any way i am worry about going back to school cos i don't want people to think i am poser and i don't know how my friends and other people are gonna react also nobody has seen me all summer do you have any tips for me i am and going into the grade eh if you're and going into th grade people already really have their opinions of you so a slight clothes change isn't going to make people care not care i'd say by that age you know who your real friends are already and it doesn't matter oh and if you were the rocker punk girl they shouldn't try to mess with you haha if anyone says anything that's just plain weird that they paid that much attention and posers are usually the underclassmen so you basically get to determine whos the poser or not  Philosophical skepticism Poser Pitaten Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide SLC Punk!

do you think acrylic nails look cheap or trashy or do you like them no i'm not talking about the big claw like ones i'm talking about the shorter ones that almost look real it totally depends on how they're done if you see a girl with really nice nails and you like the look ask her where she got them done don't just trust anyone to do them find a girl that does them really well also you have to have the money to maintain them regularly personally i don't like long nails at all and i keep mine short but i know a few people with acrylics that look pretty good  Theory of conduct Nail (anatomy) Plastic Humphrey Bogart Nine Inch Nails Static Shock Team Fortress Classic Brush Acrylic paint RuneScape quests Kodocha Laxius Power III Timeline of alternative rock Milton H.

i want to pamper and beautify myself i would like to have a day of pampering and beauty tommorrow i go back to high school next week do you have any suggestions for beauty treatments procedures i'm going to have a few girlfriends over so what can we do on our day of relaxation pampering and beauty thanks so much pair up and give each other a pedicure and manicure do several coats so it looks nice and clean for a while straighten each others hair and make it really smooth and shiny i like having others do my hair because i can't see the back of my head so its harder to know what i am doing pluck eyebrows and give a defined arch remember not to make it too thin use lots of lotion soft skin is really attractive and says to people 'i respect myself and i want to be friends with you' expirement with make up styles for school that are easy to do tell everyone to bring clothes they don't want to wear or don't have anything to wear with trade around your clothes so you get new to you atleast stuff and have ideas for outfits take your hair and look at it closely cut off cut ends go strand by strand don't attempt to cut it yourself just snip away at the specfic hairs if you have a lot of split ends that means you need to get it done but usually my hair looks much better after cutting off some of my split ends use a hair mask they feel soooo good and leave your hair really nice if you have tanlines buy a self tanner an cover up the lines use your friends for your back remember to return the favor wear plastic gloves while doing it so you don't get 'self tanner hands' make facials here are some ideas this isn't homemade but if you are looking for something to store is cheaper than ingredients for a homemade mask and is very nice look into the freeman line called 'feeling beauitful' it comes in a gree blue bottle with either a picture of papaya or cucumbers you can get a clay mask or a peel off mask i love them it costs but for the peel off masks you get over and i don't know about the clay mask since i have not used it that much definately look into those for homemade stuff honey mask recipe the best facial mask is honey place a cloth in warm water and apply to your face to open the pores smear on honey and leave on for to minutes rinse off with warm water then use cold water to close the pores use once a week miracle whip exfoliator yes i am talking about the same miracle whip your aunt mable uses in her macaroni salad apparently women all over the us are using this salad dressing ingredient on their faces to remove dead flaky skin i have not tried it myself but supposedly kraft miracle whip exfoliating facial makes an amazing treatment for normalizing over oily skin here is how you apply this miracle cream make sure all your hair is pulled back from your face apply a thin layer of the kmw all over your face up to the eyelashes and make sure to also put some on your neck the fumes from the vinegar may bother you so walk around the house to try to escape them lol leave on for minutes then massage gently the dead skin cells on your face will roll off in rubbery little balls rinse your skin with tepid water then cleanse as usual following your regular beauty regime if you apply the kmw every day in weeks your skin should be completely renewed i cannot help but wonder if this miracle whip eats away at the dead skin cells on your face what does it do to the inside of the body when someone eats it pretty scary one person believes that the vinegar in the miracle whip is what causes the exfoliation and rejuvenation if that is true why not try a mixture of organic apple cider vinegar with some olive oil apply that and see what happens one could whip together the olive oil and apple cider vinegar apply it to their face and then use the leftovers on their salad i think i will start experimenting with some ingredients and try to come up with a facial recipe to rival the kraft miracle whip special note from lucie site owner after reading victoria's email about the miracle whip beauty trick the above is an excerpt from that email i bought a small jar of miracle whip i applied a slighter thicker layer than was recommended and the vinegar smell was unpleasantly strong after a minute or two the miracle whip 'melted' and my face was very shiny and oily yuck after minutes i washed the whip away and i couldn't believe the results all the flaky dry skin was gone and my skin felt tight and smooth very strange avocado facial recipe avocado is a naturally rich moisturizer mash the meat of the avocado into a creamy texture massage into the face and neck leave on for minutes and gently rinse off facial mask recipe squeeze half a lemon and mix the juice with one beaten egg white leave on your face overnight or for a quick pick me up just minutes splash warm water on your face to rinse it helps to removes blotches because the lemon works as a bleaching agent egg honey mask recipe mix together tablespoon honey egg yolk teaspoon almond oil and tablespoon yogurt honey stimulates and smoothes egg and almond oil penetrate and moisturize and yogurt refines and tightens pores egg avocado mud facial mask recipe clay is available in powder form at any health food store mix tablespoon dry clay with egg yolk of a mashed avocado and enough witch hazel to create a smooth mixture mud dries excess sebum while the egg yolk and avocado replenish lost moisture witch hazel tones facial exfoliater recipe heaped tsp fine oatmeal tsp baking soda combine ingredients and add enough water to make a paste apply to skin and rub gently rinse and gently pat dry grape cleanser recipe grape juice makes an excellent cleanser for any skin type simply split one or two large grapes remove pips and rub the flesh over face and neck rinse off with cool water oily skin mask recipe mix tsp brewer s yeast with enough natural yogurt to make a thin mixture pat this thoroughly into all the oily areas and allow it to dry on the skin after minutes rinse off with warm water then cool water and blot dry now stuff to do on your own involves a shower therefore more of a 'solo' acticivity shave your legs or use a diplatory product ie nair veet use an exfoliating scrub all over your body scrub hard on your lower legs because lots of dead skin tends to be there don't srub your breasts that just hurts wash it with a wash cloth though gently because you can get zits on your breasts use a conditioner and leave it in finish washing get out of the shower and massage yourself listen to music exfoliate your feet etc get back in the shower after a little bit minutes the longer the more shiny and soft it will be and wash out the conditioner with cold water i like using powder and lotion after i shower i find it relaxing and makes me smell good but not overpowering have fun  Carbon dioxide Barbecue Wood Leaf Cider Cat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ketchup 613 mitzvot Mattress Bengali cuisine Milk Clothing Idli

any advice on how to make more friends sometimes alittle too outgoing so people dont like me any advice on how to mellow down okay so just so you know i'm crazy not like insane but super outgoing and just kinda out there and i started to realize that maybe i should be quieter to get more friends but i learned that the people who matter are the ones that liked how i really was being loud and outgoing might make some people look down on you but on the other hand it attracts more vivid personalities so you may not have a bajillion friends but they'll all be amazing and important to your life  One Tree Hill (TV series) Squidward Tentacles Sleeping Murder Kim Possible Green Goblin Pepper Ann Past teachings of Prem Rawat Friends Governor-General of Australia Charmed Social rule About a Boy Rich Mullins The Giver Luke Skywalker Jack Kerouac Love W.I.T.C.H.

what is the scene look i have never heard of this before do i live in a bubble is it called anything else haha i feel really stupid not knowing what this is what type of clothes do scene people wear is it like emo thanks you can make fun of me for not knowing what it is i probably should know http lanimilbus com host regularscenester jpg http c myspace com groups l jpg http c myspace com groups l jpg http c myspace com groups l jpg http c myspace com groups l jpg http c myspace com groups l jpg http c myspace com groups l jpg typical scene chick choppy short hair usually black however blonde and lots of 'strange' colors are used to make themselves look 'unique bandana in hair bows are popular heavy make up usually around the eyes sparkles are quite common fake moles have been spotted tries to pull of vintage look usually really hot but we haven't seen them with out make up so this is questionable dates only scene boys typical scene boy long bangs usually covering eyes usually black or different colors such as orange red blue purple ect make up usually centered around the eyes eye shadow black usually pink or purple tight pants extremely tight band shirt sometimes a too tight jacket usually damn sexy however they do tend to be full of themselves and unfriendly to anyone they deem unworthy or not in the scene dates scene chicks however may branch out to preps both sexes myspace over friends girl pants thinks they're not conformist may or may not be straight edge vegan scene kids usually go to local shows have extremly tight groups they may be there for the music but usually they are there for the social time scene kids are usually very picky about who they talk to and associate with if they deem you cool they may go up to you and talk to you and act as if they've known you for years go to shows after all that's where the scene is any artistic movement has a scene and that's why they're called scene kids live for shows but not all scene kids go to shows some just mosh in front of school keep up with the up and coming bands by doing your research be friends with all the local bands and brag about it it's very very important to know your music history i e norma jean if you're not able to carry on a deep conversation about lyrics style and or band mates you will be rejected when not at a show listen to your music all the time get the attitude you don't have to be vain and slightly arrogant but you must be social yet slightly socially withdrawn be very polite to people of all ages shapes ethnicities religions etc after all that's why most people look up to scenesters think that you are absolutely without a doubt the most gorgeous person on the face of the planet this is something you will have to work extra hard on if you have low self confidence practice this around other friends compliment yourself often when you do encounter your first scene friend be sure to appear overly confident in everything you do compliment others sparingly but thoughtfully remember people care about people who care about themselves become active on myspace post a plethora of pictures of yourself and shows you've been to add as many friends as you can including random scene kids and check out what they are listening to download every song ever by that band and research the band's bio other sites like purevolume and livejournal have an abundance of hardcore kids as well get hair that isn't curly you can also have different colors in your hair but it's not a must the weirder it is the more scene think 's metal hair trimmed up with all the sophistication of today it doesn't matter if you're a boy and your hair is longer it doesn't matter if you're a girl with shorter hair what matters is your ability to pull it off with confidence also you can't go wrong with getting it stacked or layered the idea is to look androgynous with your hair spike it up in the back and straighten the sides you can also straighten the bottom and mess up the top layers of your hair or you can grow out your bangs and have them over your eyes if your hair is curly get a chi straigtener and heat protecting sprays also get a well holding hairspray for humid days wear eyeliner whether you're male or female not emo eyepaint if you know how to apply eyeliner do it yourself but if you are a novice girl or guy let someone that knows how to apply makeup do it for you males have a tendency to put a little too much makeup on their faces while girls can wear as much or as little as they please wear tight skinny pencil jeans or straight leg jeans not flares bootcuts or baggy jeans while the tighter the better find a decent fit for you because no one will talk to you if you look like a fashion victim girls are recommended to have tight form fitting jeans in a vintage or dark wash girls can also wear jean skirts or black stretch skirts as long as a decent pair of leggings are worn beneath remember you can never go wrong with a pair of solid black leggings guys should find a decent fitting pair of girl jeans or somewhat of a fitted straight leg jeans aswell the tighter the better but remember that the rest of us do not want to be able to see the vein in your thigh through your jeans and don't forget the belt preferably black pyramid belts white for females usually worn with the buckle to the side stock up on band shirts or graphic tees band shirts are uni sex if you've done your music research load up on classic band t shirts i e the ramones get the tightest fitting t shirt within reason look for shirts that have the vintage feel if you can actually find a vintage shirt more scene points anything with dinosaurs on it is automatically accepted shirts with foil prints on them are also in as are shirts with any of the following on them gun butterfly bird skull lightning bolt hello kitty etc get classic shoes shoes can make you or break you vans classics that are in all black or pretty much any color that matches you this is part of the standard uniform once you get those you can feel free to branch out to any style of vans you want old school adidas nikes or converse too beat up your shoes too the more beat up and dirtier they are the better for girls ballet flats and other formal low heeled shoes also boots of any kind are accepted accessorize if you're a girl invest in necklaces that have guns hearts keys butterflies skulls etc big wooden necklaces are a good alternative do not wear gloves or arm bands of any type the only ones that are acceptable are the fingerless wrist warmers with either the skull on the back or lace trim oversized sunglasses with thick black or white frames are acceptable and cat eye frames are another good choice hats can be worn with caution though you're better off without as it is important to show off one's glory the hair girls should wear plenty of bright colored hair barrettes clips ribbons and bows if you're a guy keep your keys dangling on the side with a carabiner attached to a belt loop every scene kid should own at least one bandana often black red and white and some neon colored ones either fold it into a flag to hang out of your back pocket in a band around the head or down around your neck guys can wear hats if they don't do much hair styling a flat brim new era cap is worn to summer shows with basketball shorts a knit beanie worn over a bandana during the winter hello kitty is a big deal with both scene girls and boys be a vegetarian or vegan whatever you prefer add unnecessary letters as you type for example rawwr kiiid baaby spelling your name in odd ways is popular as well so is giving yourself a second name in addition to your first for example debby nasty ashley vogue joseph rotten michael couture etc also write very short sentences and add period at the end of almost anything tell people to not comment your myspace pictures underline bold strikeout and italicize random words in your writing  Hardcore punk

what do you think of guys that make their eyebrows thin too look better by better i mean cleaner i think that it's great that those guys care about personal hygiene if they want to then why not girls do it so guys can do it too and vice versa it's just a personal preference and frankly bushy eyebrows are a turn off to me i especially like it when guys thin their eyebrows for let's say a visual kei appearance or something like that i think it's awesome plus it speaks levels of what kind of guy he is because only the secure ones are fine with waxing shaving etc the ones who are too afraid are usually the ones who are hairy all over and think it's a man thing pfft whatever by the way the manner in which a person goes about answering a question like this also speaks levels of what kind of person he she is the close minded ignorant ones are the one who stereotype such an action as gay cough cough  Little Britain Social rule Baldness Depilation Pubic hair Beard Urinary incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) American Psycho Ren and Stimpy Hair Asperger syndrome Hiberno-English Sex and the City U.S. presidential election, 2008 Homosexuality and transgender Leviathan (book) Homestar Runner Physical attractiveness Gender role English grammar BDSM Nicomachean Ethics Moustache Human sexual behavior T'Pol Joke Transactional analysis Autism Sexual orientation Moral Politics Effeminacy Skinhead Gay slang Hearing impairment Transsexuality Bear community Dualism (philosophy of mind) Mole (South Park) Political correctness Time Out of Mind Japanese tea ceremony Hillary Rodham Clinton Gay Characters in the Smurfs Altruism Goomba The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Mental retardation Weebl and Bob Color Vlad III Dracula Avenue Q Kyle Broflovski Neuro-linguistic programming Teamo Supremo Social psychology Libertarianism Vulcan (Star Trek) Alan Keyes Traditional animation Unibrow 2004 Democratic National Convention Humphrey Bogart Friends The Devil Wears Prada Barbie Origin belief Socrates Recurring South Park characters German grammar Sinfest Philosophy of language Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Newbie Indira Gandhi The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Plame affair Totally Spies!

school pics next week is skool pics and i don't wear makeup at all can you help me figue out a way i can put a little bit of makeup on without it being tons and tons but still have that nice sweet picture day look and without my mom looking at me like what are you wearing on your face and without with my friends saying are you wearing makeup how should i put my hair up or down i think up 'cause my hair a is a tad too short right now what should i do to my hair thanks lots d no rude comments you don't need makeup to look gorgeous for school photos there are so many beautiful people in my year who don't wear makeup and looked absolutely gorgeous in the photos i think the people without makeup looked the best but if you really want to wear it then go lightly too much is definitely not a good look and you might get in trouble your weight in foundation is definitely not a recommendation i would suggest some black mascara or colourless if you're scared of getting busted by the teachers a hint of lipgloss not too shiny or red though stick to a natural sort of colour a little foundation and a tiny bit of blush i think you should stop there but if you want some more then a tiny bit of dark brown black eyeliner is good but smudge it slightly and remove some so you dont look like you have that much on the natural look is the best dont overdo it eyeshadow is unneccessary and will overdo it if you're worried about your mum then its best to drop the blush too the main things are lipgloss and mascara foundation and eyeliner isnt really needed as for your hair the only person who can tell you is yourself what do you want to see in your photos maybe do a different hairstyle than normal but not completely different simple and sweet is the best whatever you think looks nice you do it but if you're completely stuck then just go with your normal hairstyle with an extra clip or something to give it that something extra good luck and hope this helps remember its only a school photo say cheese and smile  Cosmetics Social rule Marilyn Monroe 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Dragon Booster Theory of conduct 1957 World Series Color Empire Burlesque My Little Pony Death rock fashion Physical attractiveness Phoebe Buffay's songs Kender Hair Avenue Q Kodocha Poker jargon Homestar Runner Humphrey Bogart Totally Spies!

a question about facial hair im going to try to make this understandable well heres the problem on the left side of my face my facial hair grows normal down but on the other side it starts down but by the ear it goes back it seems to grow back just turns also the left side seems to grow more than the right of my face and im trying to figure out how to make both sides of my face grow the same way they have told me to shave it in upward position sh t did not have any effect thenks in advanced well common knowledge is that the more frequently u shave the more hair growth u will see also the direction in which u shave will provoke the hair growing direction ur told to shave in upward position but how much time have u given for the hair to start growing in that direction u'd not c the results in just to shavings but u'll need to harbour patience and wait for atleast more shaves also other alternative is try using a trimmer instead of smooth shave use the trimmer more on the left side since it grows more u can thus try balancing the hair growth i think u need to consult a doctor for teh hair growth problem as it's genetic and u truly can't do anything about it as such not all the similar body parts are alike for eg some have their right feet longer or shorter then the left or vice versa lean or thicker this is applicable to ears hands so the problem ur facing is from within ur body all u can do is just try to balance it out u have either shaving daily option or trimming to balance out the growth problem as far as the direction of hair growth try to shave in a single direction and if at all u do shave in the opposite direction try and c to it that u maintain the same direction on the other side of ur face all u need to do is have a bit of patience for the direction to work out i know this coz something bit similar happened with my brother and all he had to do was shave everyday coz he wanted to shave everyday but he tried maintaining the same direction i hope it helps and cheer up it's a petty thing don't worry bout it at all be happy and all will be fine  Baldness Puberty Haircut Hair Depilation Prostate cancer Pubic hair Shaving Social rule Swingout Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Drill bit Cat Equine conformation Species Professional wrestling holds Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Waxing Shaggy dog story Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Mouse (computing) Cephalic disorder Milton H.

what should i wear for clubbing hi i am years old and i am going to go to a club the last time i went all the girls were dressed in really short skirts i wore a dress just above my knee's which i thought was short enough but once i got there i thought i looked like a nun so i was wondering what everyone thinks i should wear i don't want to look tarty thankyou lol the birthday suit thing made me laugh what so you think i should dress like the other girls here's some style advice if you obt for a skin baring daring top then cover up the bottom half so wear jeans with like a really hot top however if you choose to wear a tight short skirt then wear a less daring revealing top always remember to balance it out because if you wear top and bottom thats way too revealing you will ldefinitely ook easy and slutty which is not good because then you won't give the right impression unless that is the impression you want to give but i highly doubt that but if you wear a top and bottom thats too covered up you willl look like a nun and prudish and no one will approach you because they'll probably think you will want to lecture them on drinking and drugs and religion most importantly have fun and stay confident and be careful no one sometimes mean girls and not just guys put date rape in drinks just really be careful no one puts anything in your drinks like speed or date rape drugs always keep an eye on your drinks and if you have the slightest suspicion don't drink it  Trousers Paul Is Dead Avenue Q Marilyn Monroe Social rule Undergarment Diving suit Humphrey Bogart Sauna Customs and etiquette of Japan Nudity Japanese tea ceremony Pitaten Donovan The Marshall Mathers LP Faustyna Kowalska Prince Edmund (Blackadder) 1957 World Series The Emancipation of Mimi Jon Secada Jennifer Lopez Sin City Hijab The Critic Piccolo Junior Saga Negima Leo Frank EastEnders Gwen Stefani History of corsets Social aspects of clothing The Apprentice 2 Alcoholics Anonymous Friends Suit (clothes) Spidey Super Stories Sinfest Aerial (dance move) Pantyhose Hall & Oates Girls Aloud Dragon Booster Roxette Cliff Richard Charmed Bicycle Skinhead The Smoking Room Shorts Trailer Park Boys The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Theory of conduct Good Morning, Vietnam The Ashlee Simpson Show Fancy Crane Satchel Paige Whose Line Is It Anyway?

at home spa ideas im having my own at home spa but sadly i need ideas help me i need to know what to do what i should eat and everything else i want to actually feel like im at a real spa so i need decoration ideas as well oh and what should i wear please help me i want to spend the whole day in days relaxing and having a great time oh and i cant go out and buy anything mostly likely can you also give me some websites that might help please i really need this break sounds way fun here are my suggestions for drinks most spas offered citrus flavored waters but not strongly flavored to make it just pick a couple of different fruits like a lemon a lime and an orange cute them into slices and put the slices in the water for a bit just before your guests arrive so that when they get there and you pour a drink for them the taste is still very fresh for food i would have some little chocolates on hand it's a spa day and women are there to relax and nothing makes us relax more than a little piece of chocolate don't have too much because women will be tempted to eat a lot of it and we don't like that either for the actual spa treatments that you will be doing there are a few simple things you can do you said that you can't really buy anything which will be tough but if you end up being able to go shopping i would recommend running to a store like wal mart and buying a french manicure kit not the fake nails just the nail polish kit it will have instructions in it and little tools to use so that you can do it to yourself you can use it on your fingernails your toenails i love them and always have one on hand it looks very neat and professional if you follow the instructions depending on how many people you will have there you may want to buy kits you'll also want some regular nail polish on hand for women who just want a solid color another great spa treatment are facials you can definitely create some of your own at home a good way to open up your pores is to get a small bowl and fill it with boiling hot water make sure that your face is completely clean no makeup on it take a dishcloth or towel and while putting your face over the bowl of hot water put the towel around your head hair so that you are just above the water and that heat can unlock your pores it's very relaxing and feels great afterwards another good at home facial scrub is a brown sugar mask if you scrub your face with it it feels so nice afterwards too but be sure to combine it with water you can also use oatmeal honey if that's more convenient or you can just go to a store like wal mart again and they sell individually packaged face masks each with a different purpose they are very cheap and you can just buy a bunch of different kinds of masks let your friends pick out whichever ones seem good to them wear comfortable clothes don't get overly dressed up it's just a comfy event provide all the slippers you can for your guests so that their feet are comfortable and if you have any massage chairs or foot massage vibrators i would recommend busting those out too play some relaxing music in the background keep the lights kind of dim or let in lot's of natural light don't over decorate too much just make the room seem as airy and light as possible and remember to have fun too because you need to enjoy yourself too best of luck  Breakfast Sento Japanese tea ceremony Customs and etiquette of Japan Coffee Tea Hamster Tofu Bread Cuisine of Denmark Upholstery Wood carving Japanese cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Rum Sauna Chocolate Ramen Tattoo Social rule The Apprentice 2 Massage Professional wrestling match types Strap-on dildo Ice cream Cuisine of Brazil Textile manufacturing Microeconomics Little Britain Professional wrestling slang Fecal incontinence Japanese toilet Jewish cuisine Sears Holdings Corporation Brewery Menstrual cup Humphrey Bogart Glass Avenue Q Mattress Beer The Amazing Race Bong Yerba mate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gatorade Theory of conduct Wine Korean cuisine Teen Girl Squad Dim sum Diving suit Sin City Tire Cat Physical attractiveness Wal-Mart Great Teacher Onizuka Plastic The Penultimate Peril In-N-Out Burger Ron and Fez Shoe Domesticated turkey Swimming pool Tooth The Inside Clothing Fancy rat Futurama (TV series - season 2) Nail (anatomy) 613 mitzvot Knife Paul Is Dead Vinegar Domestic rabbit Porridge Dragon Booster Sushi Acne McDonald's Urinary incontinence Mid-levels Surveillance Roman eating and drinking Breastfeeding Sea-Monkey Happy Tree Friends Chopsticks The Smoking Room

hollister aero abercrombie ae unfair why do people always obsess about the prices or the just clothing at these stores okay because they are not expensive you would pay just as much at oldnavy or jcpennys or macys they say you are paying for the label not the quality hello tommy hilfiger ralph lauren dior chanel oldnavy and lacoste they have their label all over there clothes tommy hilfiger even has their colors all over it yet people dont talk crap about them they dont sayy ohh well you're just payin for that rich old mans label and not how good or how long its gonna last why do they attack abercrombie soo much soo what if people like its comfortable why are people hating soo much on a f hollister ae not so much aeropostale but its gets it fair share how come people dont talk about the other labels but talk soo much shit about the ones i listed and i know some people might say oh well its the culture well what about tommy hilfiger it has a culture to you know its mostly black people and other just like a f mostly white other i adore abercromibe and hollister and ae they have the cutest clothes and i don't think they're pricey i mean nothing that i've ever gotten at abercrombie or hollister has ever ripped and i've been shopping there since i was like now i'm and when i grow out of my clothes my sister picks out what she wants and we give the rest away and they are still in perfect condition i mean the only reason they should rip is if you got too small of a size and it stretched too much and made a hole in it but that would happen with any brand not just abercrombie and people are always saying that people who shop at abercrombie are anorexic or unhealthy but there are different types of body types and some people are naturally skinny like me and others who shop at abercrombie hollister and some people are naturally fat so why don't the fat people just go to a plus sized store instead of complaining about the price quality image that abercrombie is putting out and people say that everyone wears those clothes and you should have your own style but if you like the clothes it is your style it's just a more popular style than like hot topic or some other store and i agree that you can get the same price for a shirt on clearance at hollister that is regular price at like macy's so just look in clearance if you're tight on money and if it weren't for abercrombie or hollister i'd be wearing like an xs in some other store and it would still be too big for me so i think people should just get over it cuz everyone has different body types and different styles and abercrombie hollister ae are made for the preppy slim people so don't get mad cuz you can't fit into the clothes sorry i wrote so much but there's alot to say so i hope this helped and keep wearing a f and the other stores u listed no matter what anyone says  Abercrombie & Fitch Co.

not to sound so spoiled or anything ok here comes another abercrombie and hollister and ae question goodness do you consider these stores expensive honestly i dont think it's expensive at all although i agree for a some tshirts at af is but otherwise i think rest of it is fair price i didnt know this but do people shop there to make themselves look rich or something i have no intention to look like i belong in a certain clique when i shop at these stores but simply because i like their clothes btw i never wear tshirts that has their store name written across the chest i never buy graphic t's anyways why do some people hate people who shop there i dont hate people who shop at like hot topic uhhh im not looking for attention wtf i'm just really curious why people have so much hate towards certain brands of clothing it's all about value people who shop at particular stores are shopping there for particular benefits it may be the quality of the clothing the styles they provide or the prestige associated with the brand if they get the value they want they'll pay the price for certain people the money is worth more than any of those factors of value for others it's not people who dislike anyone who shops at a store that's regarded as cool feel that way because of the struggle most people at some point in their lives face about conformity and individuality they see the people as people who are more concerned with fitting in than each being his or her own person in reality there has to be a balance conforming to standards is not reasonably optional but being different to a certain extent can be valuable fashion is like a lot of things in life the better you know the rules and guidelines the more room you have to bend and break them if you look at fashion historically you can see that today's fashion has been shaped by people in the past who did things that were considered unusual during grade school however fashion is much less sophisticated and therefore holds less potential mostly you're going to see fads that come and go one clique will identify with a certain fad another clique will do the opposite to tighten their own group in the end humans are very tribal we're instinctively competitive yet inexorably gregarious we need friends and enemies not either or grade school is just the tip of the iceberg don't sweat the small stuff if you like the clothes and the people whose opinions you value most like them then there's really no question as for an objective view of those clothes being expensive they really aren't you can get cheaper sure but the high end of fashion prices goes much much higher  Supply and demand Goodness and value theory Clothing Microeconomics Social aspects of clothing High school subcultures Theory of conduct Electronic commerce Inflation Infantilism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Law of value Abortion debate Airsoft Human nature Fashion Insurance Advertising Surplus product Paintball Mattress Fashion design Gender role Illegal drug trade Ethical consumerism Japanese tea ceremony Socrates American individualist anarchism Publicly funded medicine Jennifer Lopez Tariff Education in the United States Digital photography Competition Mercantilism Ethics Social rule Economics Abercrombie & Fitch Co.

why do teen boys tuck in the front of their polo shirts although it is a strange style it is better than many i see high school kids wearing these days since when did the flock of seagulls hair style come back i believe most boys guys do this when they're wearing belts men's shirts are not typically made to show off a belt b c of length so they tuck in the front and leave the rest out if they tuck it all in they may feel as though they look like a yr old golfer it's fashion it doesn't usually make sense  Kilt Haircut Shirt Japanese tea ceremony Aerial (dance move) Skinhead Emo fashion Kimono Recess (TV series) Comanche Diving Jesuit College Preparatory School My Life as a Teenage Robot Undergarment Sari Equine conformation Water polo Nip/Tuck Clothing Breakdancing Boy band Gurkha Contingent Tennis shirt 21st Century Emo Kodocha Beavis and Butt-head Grunge music United States Marine Corps John Cena Teen Girl Squad Death rock fashion Saved by the Bell One Tree Hill (TV series) Skirt and dress Coat (clothing) Speedo (suit style) Boy Scouts of America Social aspects of clothing Doug Heavy metal fashion T-shirt Suit (clothes) Hakama Lindy Basic Billy the Kid Napoleon Dynamite Emo Animal Crossing Stocking Waistcoat Recurring South Park characters Golf Mario Professional wrestling holds Piccolo (Dragon Ball) SpongeBob SquarePants Fat Man and Little Boy (Simpsons) Venturing (BSA) Totally Spies!

why does society dictate that women have to be completely hairless to be beautiful it's almost perverse the way completely bare pubic areas are the norm for a year old child and a year old woman the vast majority of us women have to go to great lengths shaving and waxing to make sure we are silky smooth i just was wondering why it is so unacceptable to most guys for us to have a little hair i know what you mean it's pretty interesting since women shaving is relatively new thing in u s culture it was less than years ago when gillette began marketing to women that it's feminine to shave their legs and underarms before that hair was just fine now suddenly we're dirty if we don't look like a prepubescent child which is a whole other matter especially since it's actually heathier and safer to keep your pubic hair it serves a purpose  Pubic hair Hair Puberty Depilation Beard Shaving Haircut Razor Social role of hair Child Gender role Waxing Global Gillette Guinea pig Human sexual behavior Human Effeminacy Delayed puberty Vulva Swimsuit Paraphilia Skinhead Pornography in Japan Androgen insensitivity syndrome 613 mitzvot Human sexuality Moustache Wig (hair) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Social rule Crab louse Hypertrichosis Brave New World Major League Baseball television contracts Pornography The Amber Spyglass Pedophilia Asperger syndrome Blond Customs and etiquette of Japan Kodocha Nudity Grunge music Brazilian waxing 2004 Republican National Convention Phonograph cylinder Cosmetics My Little Pony Feminism Abortion debate Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Late Night with Conan O'Brien Clothing Plastic Undergarment Dilbert Female genital cutting Paul Is Dead Friends Slavery Leaf AFI 100 Years series The Six Million Dollar Man American Conservatism Tourism Child sexual abuse Hippie Wood carving The Sims 2 Phoebe Buffay's songs Human development Married... with Children Katana Carl Jung Girl Bear community Leather Media and ethnicity Ranma __ characters Joke Neopaganism Brylcreem Dog Qing Dynasty Sento Testosterone Childlove movement History of subcultures in the 20th century Joe Namath Baseball Playboy (magazine) Boards of Canada Braun Women in Islam Rastafari movement Han Chinese clothing

what should i wear for the first day of school i want to look super cute yet be comfortable i prefer jeans over skirts ok this sounds just like me we'll for my if it is kind of cold where you are you should wear skinny jeans but if it is hot just wear like denim short that has holes in it and for a shirt you should wear a nice blouse like a short sleeve shirt or a tubetop with flowers on it like almost beachy looking and for shoes wear flip flops or like black flats and wear like a black head band so it can match the black flats or the flip flops and jewlery i would keep it simply not too much maybe like dangling earrings or maybe a pearl necklace stuff like that and maybe wear your hair down straighten and for makeup just keep it simply just like the jewlery like lipgloss and light eyeshadow with a blush that kinda matches your skin tone listen i hope i helped and good luck for the first day of school  Skinhead Bob Jones University Heavy metal fashion Diving suit Paul Is Dead Cosmetics Death rock fashion Mario Skirt and dress Japanese tea ceremony Comanche Canadian Armed Forces Violin The Warriors Denim Jesuit College Preparatory School Shirt Aerial (dance move) Suit (clothes) Gothic Lolita Professional wrestling throws Punk fashion Poker jargon Gramophone record Emo fashion Kilt Academic dress of Oxford University Grunge music Black Jeans School uniform Dragon Booster Napoleon Dynamite Social aspects of clothing Marching band Padm__ Amidala Beachwear Undergarment Fast bowling Haircut Trousers Black tie Coat (clothing) Nakoruru (Samurai Shodown) Troll Animal Crossing Lhoba High-heeled shoe Clothing terminology Raffles Girls' School (Secondary) Stereoscopy Physical attractiveness Marilyn Monroe Happy Tree Friends Johnny Appleseed Irish dance Girls Aloud Roxette Khampti Skateboarding trick Pearl Codename: Kids Next Door Characters of Naruto Bonfires of Saint John Suplex Jean Charles de Menezes Jewellery Swimming Raffles Institution Japanese school uniform Okashina Okashi Not The Nine O'Clock News Curling Clothing Shoe Textile manufacturing terminology Professional wrestling slang Madonna (entertainer) Mattress Kimono Urban beach Skate punk Phil and Lil DeVille Nu people Court dress The McGuire Sisters Doug Sailor fuku Equine conformation Churcher's College Sly & the Family Stone Rich Mullins Beavis and Butt-head Arsenal F.C.

what can you do to make yourself feel prettier people tell me that i'm pretty but it's so hard to believe because it's much easier to find negative qualities about yourself than positive and those magazines with supermodels in them don't help any either because you always try to compare yourself to them and then you feel so ugly and worthless what do i do key word compare comparing is what lowers our self esteem eliminate that from your daily routine and life will be much easier people always get jealous of others examples your eyes are amazing you're sooo thin you have great fashion sense you're sooooooooo pretty we all gotta turn those statements around quit saying you and start focusing on yourself and your good qualities looking at other people with jealousy is a terrible habit who cares if they're pretty it doesn't matter look in the mirror every day and say great things about yourself it doesn't have to be appearance think of your personality too also looking at other people who seem really pretty leads us to finding negative things about them we might look at someone pretty and then keep looking until we find a pimple or a dirty tooth or something another nasty habit what i'm trying to say is quit comparing p s ignore the media they are crazy we are all beautiful  Theory of conduct Socrates Procrastination Social rule Art Friends Ben Johnson (athlete) Maison Ikkoku Time Out of Mind Kodocha Beauty Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Kender Anne Rice Marilyn Monroe Ethics Transactional analysis Jon Secada The Amazing Race Anime Spice Girls Philosophical skepticism Totally Spies!

what's the difference between these nails what's the difference between acrylic gel crystals and solar nails i have acrylics to help me from biting my nails but i was wondering the difference between them all i've heard that a silk wrap is best for your nails but i can't afford that right now anyone have a clue acrylic nails acrylic nails are the strongest and last the longest of all the nail overlays but if it's not done well these nails can look thick and very artificial find a manicurist who is an expert at applying acrylic nails and you can get a very thin natural looking nail they usually need to be filled in every two to three weeks as your nails grow but depending on how hard you are on your nails you may need to see the manicurist sooner to avoid nail loosening which can lead to mildew if water gets trapped underneath and if a professional removes them properly the acrylic nails should cause little weakening to the nail plate one factor that might make you choose acrylic it is the most commonly used artificial nail if you travel a great deal it will be easier for you to find a place to repair or fill in your manicure silk linen and fiber wraps wraps are pieces of silk linen or fiberglass that have been cut to the desired shape and glued to the nail plate this adds strength and sometimes length to the nail though done on natural nails wraps are most commonly used to strengthen tips silk is the most natural looking wrap and provides a lot of flexibility but it is often too delicate for those with an active lifestyle linen is stronger but it is not transparent and appears quite thick fiberglass is the best of both worlds since it provides the natural look of silk and the strength of linen gel nails once these nails were made of dental porcelain gel powder now manicurists use a mylar form to sculpt your nail and then cure or set it under an ultraviolet light because of this process gel nails may need to be filled in less often than acrylic nails though fill ins are still necessary and a professional must remove the tips solar nails solar nails are similar to a french manicure and applied in a two step process the white tip of the nail is applied first followed by the application of the pink part of the nail solar nails are chip free and long lasting needing to be refilled every three weeks benefits of the solar nails are that they do not turn colors or turn to gel when under the lamps of a tanning bed plus they do not need to dry which makes them more convenient  Nail (anatomy) Casting Plastic Manicure Drill bit Upholstery Seismic retrofit Textile manufacturing Violin Textile manufacturing terminology Mattress Screw Glass Psoriasis Pottery Welding Knife Paint Shroud of Turin Wood Carbon nanotube Bong Tire Ultraviolet Explosive material Leather Laser engraving Tooth Diamond Printed circuit board Knitting Jute Japanese tea ceremony Light-emitting diode Sundial Tofu Polyethylene terephthalate Timpani Boat building Lacquer Solar cell Gelatin Sewage treatment Wound healing phases Strap-on dildo Agarose gel electrophoresis Equine conformation The Legend of Zelda series enemies Material properties of diamond Aluminium Polymethyl methacrylate Internal ballistics Terminal ballistics Yarn Flax Guitar Optical fiber Gas metal arc welding Space elevator Powder metallurgy Opportunity rover Dairy Genericized trademark Billiards Wood carving Tea Menstrual cup Fecal incontinence Handloading Snowboard Diamond cut Silicon Masonry Woodworking Floppy disk Windsurfing Radio controlled airplane Solar sail Chocolate Polymerase chain reaction Colours, standards and guidons Gesso Deck (ship) Stage lighting Corrosion Cyanoacrylate Clinker (boat building) Ammunition Dialysis Canoe

ok i know this is going to sound like a really weird question but i want to get my nails done but i have wieirdly shaped thumb nails as they are quite wide basically i don't want to go to get them done only to be told that they don't have nails to fit as that would be really embarassing my question is do they have a wide range of sizes of nails and so this scenario is unlikely to happen hiya no that isn't likely to happen at all there are wider artificial tips available however check with the salon first before you book as they may not have them in stock other than that you could always have them sculpted on thats where they place a piece of foil on the nail build the nail from either acrylic of gel if i were you i would go with gel gel is much kinder to your own nail underneath xx  Manicure Violin Bass guitar "Weird Al" Yankovic Bong Lighting Stairway Anchor Screw Double bass Milton H.

i want to start modeling i really want to get into modeling but for an year old girl what weight do you have to be if your ' remember for an year old girl im not worrying about it i love my body and im not overweight at all i was just wondering me and my mother were both models before it looks like alot of fun but really requires alot of work sometimes they make you drive hours away and you dont even get picked to be in an advertisement sometimes you wait around for hours just to get interviewed and sent home its an empty buisness if u really want to though have a photographer take pictures of you and send them to an agency if you have what there looking for they will probably call you and set up an interview and maybe you can get into some photoshoots and commercials but then again you have to be photogenic with alot of confidence your weight doesnt matter it all depends on what the agency is looking for good luck  Social rule Atomic Kitten Modelling agency Patricia Ford Jennifer Lopez The Ashlee Simpson Show Marilyn Monroe Sharon Tate Photography Advertising Anorexia nervosa The Inside Super Size Me Sony Menstrual cup Piccolo Junior Saga Mnemonic Surveillance Milton H.

guys shaving facial hair what are some of the best products you guys have tried while giving yourself a shave some pointers would be appreciated too thanks never use foam shaving cream always use gel it's much smoother and it keeps you from getting cut as often plus if you want to shave and look clean but not have a perfectly clean cut look and you want to keep a little scruff just shave with an electric razor it'll leave just a tiny bit of hair which the chicks dig i think  Shaving Razor Haircut Global Gillette Beard Barber Pubic hair Depilation Head shaving Leg shaving Hair Payot Cosmetology Shampoo Pseudofolliculitis barbae 613 mitzvot Braun Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Baldness Cat Tattoo Moustache Joe Namath Sento Drill bit Dog Psoriasis Toilet paper Tonsure Mohawk hairstyle Social role of hair Facial feminization surgery Kodocha Manicure Buddy Guy Fluoride therapy Late Night with Conan O'Brien Carrageenan Ice cream Tofu Brylcreem Steganography The Mikado Mouse (computing) Herpes simplex virus Shaved Fish Rastafari movement Dairy Waxing Polystyrene Oakland Athletics Hair conditioner Brewery Soap Three Stooges Sideburns Egg white Violin Teen Girl Squad Jesus Ice resurfacer Gelatin Tarantula Kurt Angle Goatee Portuguese Water Dog Pointer Sisters Genericized trademark Pottery Ron and Fez Cheese Diamond Lucha libre Coffee A Close Shave Johnny Damon Mange Villain Wet and messy fetishism Woodworking Drilling and threading Wallace and Gromit Megan Griffin Logging Ren and Stimpy Thank God It's Doomsday Foam Wood router E number Secondary sex characteristic Wig (hair) Joker (comics) Sodium dodecyl sulfate Automated external defibrillator Boy band Vow The Rabbit of Seville Laser I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Jason Voorhees

what is a brazilian wax job i am interested in what exactly this entails i have had bikini waxes and my legs but i have this horrible sneaking suspicion that it involves removing all personal hair and has anyone actually waxed that region it sounds terrifying i have recently found that veet hair remover can be used for that and works like a charm with no burning or other after effects but i still want to know about a brazilian i am interested in what exactly this entails i have had bikini waxes and my legs but i have this horrible sneaking suspicion that it involves removing all personal hair and has anyone actually waxed that region it sounds terrifying i have recently found that veet hair remover can be used for that and works like a charm with no burning or other after effects but i still want to know about a brazilian aaauuuuggghhh is my first reaction to answers but here's another part for those people who got used to it doesn't that mean you lose sensation there and it affects your sexual experience how to 'brazilian wax' or what to expect when you sign up to get one from julyne derrick your guide to beauty free newsletter sign up now brazilian bikini waxes have been 'all the rage' since the late 's but they're certainly not new the us brazilian waxing was introduced to new york in by seven brazilian born sisters so how does it differ from a regular bikini wax basically with the brazilian hair is removed in the front back everything in between most of the time a 'landing strip' is left in the front but some clients opt for everything removed difficulty average time required minutes here's how most waxings occur in a private room with a door i have heard of some with just a curtain between you and others you remove your pants underwear lie on a table with clean paper or sheets it is possible that you could be provided with a paper thong but chances are you won't because you only need about a quarter inch of hair for the wax to grab onto your waxer will start by trimming your pubic hair to the right length the best waxers are fast which means less discomfort for you the waxer will dip a waxing stick into a pot of hot wax then spread it onto your skin hair she will then apply a cloth strip over the still warm wax pressing firmly so the cloth hair and wax adhere to one another when the wax has cooled she will pull the strip off in the opposite direction of your hair growth pulling the hairs out by the root most likely your waxer will tweeze any stray hairs waxing usually starts in the front moves toward the back you'll likely have to move around in all sorts of odd positions in order for the waxer to do her job once the waxing is over the waxer will spread soothing lotion over the waxed areas you should ask what to do in case of bumps redness or ingrown hairs your waxer should be trained in this don't forget to get the name of the waxer so when you make another appointment you can get the same person so you don't have to bare all for another complete stranger wink tips the procedure like any waxing can be very painful at first but frequent visits usually cuts down on the pain factor i suggest taking a couple advil at least minutes before your procedure as for the embarrassment factor we like to think getting a brazilian can't be any more embarrassing than a typical visit to your gynecologist's office these aestheticians have seen it all before the downside of a brazilian wax while it lasts as much as weeks the hair will grow back you'll have to do it again another downside hair has to be a certain length before it can sucessfully waxed another down side you might experience red bumps or ingrown hairs  Pubic hair Depilation Casting Waxing Volleyball Strap-on dildo Puberty Undergarment Brazilian waxing Skateboarding trick Manicure Aerial (dance move) Massage Fecal incontinence Sento Japanese tea ceremony Cross-country skiing Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Professional wrestling match types Professional wrestling throws Urinary incontinence Acne Snooker Hair Professional wrestling slang Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Professional wrestling holds Nudity Swimming Shaving Social rule Childbirth Wax play Androgen insensitivity syndrome 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Tattoo Betting (poker) Comanche Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Poker jargon Dog Milton H.

what is the best outfit for a baby pageant my baby is months old and im gonna sing her in for a baby pageant but can you tell me what should be a good outfit for her she has a light brown hair dark brown eyes ligth skin color like a peach why because i like baby pageants and after two boys this is my little baby girl well i don't want her to look like a clown i just want to dress her cute no make up or anything im gonna sign no sing it depends if it's for a state fair or county fair most contests will tell you that you have to dress the baby in a onesie and a diaper that's it the reason they do this is so judges aren't distracted by a frilly costume giving a parent who can afford a nice dress an advantage over another parent who may not be able to afford 'pageant wear' if it's a real pageant the baby will be expected to wear the frilly pageant dress like here http www universalroyalty com pageantclothes htm i think it's a shame that we can't enjoy our baby girls for just being babies and instead we load their little faces with makeup and put frilly dresses on them and parade them around to be judged it starts way too early edit i think with your baby's coloring a yellow or peach dress or emerald green would look stunning good luck it's not my place to judge what you as a parent decide to do i might do the same thing if i had a daughter but i only had one and he's a boy  The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Beauty contest Sharon Tate Mario Teen Girl Squad My Little Pony Clown Black Paul Is Dead Negima Physical attractiveness Joker (comics) The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Dragon Booster Frankie Laine Boy band The Amazing Race Drag queen Infantilism Diaper Triple J Hottest 100, 2003 Comanche Gothic Lolita Miss America Totally Spies!

silk wrap fiberglass are they better for your nails can you see the silk under the nail or does it look the same as acrylic if you could explain what they are or have some pics that would be great unfortunatly i have no pics of silk wraps but i can describe it to you and explain it to you as simply as i can it is silk that is usually peeled off a peice of paper cut to fit the size of your nail either your natural nail or your nail with a tip on it this is where you get the strength to keep your nails some of the silk is thinner than others some looks on the thicker side sometimes you can see it yes it really depends on how well your nail tech can do it and you should not touch it with your finger as you will get oils from your finger on it as your placeing it on your nail it may cause your glue to not stick well or cause it to lift it away fiberglass is done the same way then there is a resin dripped on top of the silk or fiberglass and then a spray is sprayed on top of that to cause the resin glue to harden now there are other ways of doing the silks and fiberglass some use products that they can simply polish on with a brush and use a ultraviolet light to cure it to harden to answer you next question about are they better for your nails i have been a nail tech for years and i am retired now i have been wearing acrylics all this time yes 'i have tried fiberglass and silk but they just do not stay on me as well as acrylics do so i have worn the acrylics of my time i will tell you my theory on it i do not think that anything you put on your nails is good for them other than strengthening products polishes oils etc as over a period of time your natural nails will get thin from fileing buffing and be more seseptable sp to hurting when you bump them or they will be more easily to feel heat or cold when in water so you may want to outweigh the good or bad for me it's too late as i have to continue to wear them to protect my natural nails now from soreness when i bump them or pain from hot water and my cuticals will dry out very badly to the point of peeling and sores the fiberglass and silks lift the same way that acrylics do and you will need to have fills balances done on them the same way one thing i would like to pled with you to do or rather not do is do not go to the asian shops to have your nails done go to a regular salon and talk to the nail tech ask what she he reccomends for you and why ask what the name of the product they will be useing on you is make sure they have clean instruments and they wash their hands or disinfect them before they touch you and disinfect yours as well or allow you to wash them if they do not tell you what product they use on you then you need to leave so many asian shops use a product in their nail system called methol methocrylate which is a dental bonding agent so the product literly adheirs to your nail bed this means it is not good for your nails and they have to literly file off the product they cannot soak it off with pure acetone as it should be they cause pain by nippin up the old nailtip which pulls off a layer of natural nail with it i can tell you loads more well good luck and hope you make the right decision  Upholstery Paint Mattress Nail (anatomy) Textile manufacturing Printed circuit board Fiberglass Knife Boat building Violin Menstrual cup Pottery Tattoo Carbon fiber Tire Pedicure Guqin Drill bit Organic peroxide Leather Polymethyl methacrylate Fly fishing Textile manufacturing terminology Timpani Radio controlled airplane Lacquer Equine conformation Tofu Hair Dairy Thermal power station Wood Brewery Ultraviolet Adhesive Cello Milton H.
