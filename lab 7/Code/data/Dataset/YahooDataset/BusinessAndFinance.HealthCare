nurses i just graduated as an rn and start my first day on the unit tomorrow any words of advice by tomorrow i mean friday however i would still love for anyone to answer after tomorrow as well o i am starting on a med surg unit general surgery night shift i did a round of clinicals in school on the same unit where i will be working but i am still very nervous my clinicals were during the day so i won't recognize any of the nurses if you have any suggestions advice or words of encouragement i would love to hear it what can i expect i will have a preceptor at first but i am still feeling overwhelmed at the thought of so much responsibility talking to the doctors especially if i have to call them for something overnight eek and taking verbal orders i was the girl within my clinical group that wasn't afraid to admit that i felt unsure of myself and if possible always preferred to have a nurse with me when i was starting ivs doing procedures etc i know confidence is important so i guess i will have to fake it in the meantime it can be alittle daunting to be sure when you are new i myself am starting a new specialty and also am alittle unsure of waters most of my background is med surg ortho neuro oncology hospice now i am starting cardiac and plasty but with a strong med surg background i believe i may suggest that you ask plenty of questions no matter how stupid you might think that they are if there is one thing i remember from my early post grad years it's seasoned nurses complaining that the new grads try to come across as not appearing igorant so they don't say anything when they are genuinely finding their way they fear being labled so they stay quiet and nod their heads alot hopefully you will ask alot of questions check on your patients as often as you need to especially if they have questionable vitals pain issues confusion or post op parameters don't wait for your patients to ask for pain meds especially if they have just had surgery your preceptor will help you if you need to call a physician during the night have the following ready the m a r the chart most recent vitals and lung sounds urine output and what is running in the iv have the history page opened in case the doc doesn't know them if he starts to rattle off orders tell him to slow down if you need time to jot down what he says and read it back to him document that you read it back to him document document document if you make a mistake or if you make a med error bring it to your preceptors' attention immediately calmly and seek guidance if you aren't comfortable with the outcome speak with the lead or chg rn thank your preceptor for being willing to work with you it isn't easy to have a patient load and try to teach i love new nurses it means more help and less working extra god bless you hon  Medicine Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milton H.

any pharmacists i'm a senior in high school and this may sound really cheesey but i want to do something that helps people but i was wondering how much patient interaction there actually is in pharmacy also what kind of hours do pharmacists work i want to have a life outside of work and a family so is being a pharmacist too much of a demanding career to have a life outside of work i know in retail pharmacy you would see the patients but what about in hospital pharmacy is it a satisfying career if youre a pharmacist do you really feel like you are helping people i'm not a pharmacist but i worked as a rn in hospitals for years pharmacists in hospitals get absolutely no patient contact they spend all of their day in the hospital pharmacy getting medications ready to send to the floors so that the nurses can give them to the patients from what i've seen in places like walgreen's is that every once and awhile a customer will ask a question of a pharmacist but they spend most of the time filling prescriptions i applaud you for wanting a career that is helpful to others and i think that you are very smart to realize that to have a satisfying family life you need to have a career that is not so damanding as to leave no time or energy for your family life i wish that i had realized that at your age both pharmacists and rns in hospitals work very fast paced demanding jobs you also have to spend extra time after work taking workshops and courses to keep abreast of new information pharmacists in retail pharmacies have first and second shift to cover in hospitals pharmacists work all three shifts also in both retail and hospitals weekend work is required as a rn i found that working different shifts and weekends was very detrimental to my private and my family life what i have come to realise is that if you can the best type of job to have a satisfying family life is a job where you work straight days and have every w e and holiday off i would encourage you to investigate what types of careers offer those work hours i'm y o now and think that i helped a lot of people working in hospitals but working different shifts and almost every holiday ruined my personal life  Medical prescription Pharmacy Target Corporation Shoppers Drug Mart Physician Milton H.

regarding a degree in nursing is a bs equal to an rn the sign on bonus's are they paid to new graduates i would need an online program and at per credits how far will finacial aid get me i could only afford a month if anyone else has experience getting thru this please let me know also what do they pay an unexperienced nurse straight out of clinicals bs and as and ms are college degrees rn is a license from the state you could have an ms in nursing and still fail the rn exam though not likely you can qualify to take the rn exam with an asn bsn or msn the higher the degree the greater your responsibility and pay a bsn start to finish online would be nearly impossible to do the bsn programs you see out there that are online are for nurses who already have an rn and the asn you may be able to find a hybrid program where part is online and part is in the classroom clinicals a month won't buy books the only way to know what financial aid you can get is to apply per three credits is a really good price but it's very likely that your local community college is even cheaper sign on bonuses are paid to new employees who are hired some are for experienced nurses only others for certain jobs some places need nurses so badly they want anyone who is an rn the average hourly for a new rn is just under an hour some jobs or places pay more some a little less based on a hour week that's a week a month or per year not too bad eh master's nurses average over per year what i'd suggest since you don't have a bunch of money go down to your local community college and talk to them about their asn program get that first apply for all of the aid they will give you don't turn down loans automatically consider the amount that nurses earn compared to what you earn now when you think about loans ie when you make k a year a month payment is a lot when you make k a year is lunch money for a week once you get the asn and your rn license years then start looking at rn to bsn online programs another years which at that point you will be able to easily afford at that point you'd have the bsn and years of experience a really nice position to be in to negotiate for top dollar nursing jobs sometimes we have to suck it up and tighten the belt for a couple years knowing that in just a couple years our life will be much improved for it just a few thoughts  Nurse Graduate school Student loan Education in the United States Wal-Mart Education in Germany Unemployment Minimum wage Life insurance Microeconomics Education in Romania Unemployment benefit Bretton Woods system Juris Doctor Real estate broker Education in Portugal Paralegal 401(k) Wheel of Fortune Great Depression Publicly funded medicine Inflation Lawyer Poker jargon Money supply Monetary policy Bond Social Security (United States) MMORPG Health insurance Capitalism Canadian and American health care systems compared Education in Australia Grade (education) Price discrimination National Kidney Foundation Singapore Professor Associate's degree Mortgage Physical therapy Extreme Programming Blackjack Marshall Plan Community college Affirmative action Health care in the United States Capital accumulation Economy of the United States Education in Finland Predatory lending Supply and demand Hyperinflation Principal-agent problem Medicare (United States) PE ratio Satchel Paige Physician Teacher Software engineering Annuity Economy of El Salvador Primerica Financial Services Bank Progressive tax Monopoly (game) Insurance Social Security debate (United States) Copyleft Education in Japan Jeopardy!

has anyone made a career change into nursing successfully i have a bs in business and have worked in banking for years i'm thinking of transitioning into nursing but i was wondering if anyone else out there has a similar experience and how it all worked out i want to go back to school to become a nurse but don't know what to do with my full time job any suggestions i was an accountant and after i had my family i decided to change career and do something that was more worthwhile and personally satisfying i did volunteer work at my local hospital and then they asked me to join them as a health care assistant which i did for a year which gave me a real feel for the environment and helped me to decide whether nursing was for me i went to university to study nursing for three years then got a job on a surgical ward as a registered nurse i found that nursing was a true vocation and i loved being able to care for people physically emotionally and socially however after a few years of being there the love of the job has gone its not the nursing just the politics of healthcare the conflicts with staff the lack of equipment and supplies the red tape and paperwork the blame culture the lack of organisational support having to watch your back not being able to make the smallest mistake without the organisation coming down on you like a tonne of bricks the pressure of understaffing the fact that more and more work is put upon you and they expect you to be able to cope the fact that nurses are being expected to take on more doctors jobs on the ward without financial gain and the inflexibility of rostering and i've been fighting a pay dispute for over a year as i am not being paid enough all in all it was not how i expected it to be and it has been a real disappointment to me i am seriously considering leaving i would suggest you apply to do some voluntary work at your local hospital but spend the time watching the work of the registered nurse see if you want their stress level and their responsibility the training takes a long time and you need to know what you are letting yourself in for good luck  Nurse Unemployment Nursing United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East Publicly funded medicine National Health Service Ambulance Health insurance Education in Portugal Social rule Medicine National Kidney Foundation Singapore Education in the People's Republic of China Reiki Chinese University of Hong Kong Ethics International response to Hurricane Katrina Reparative therapy Transsexuality Nursing home Mental Health Act 1983 Vivian Solon Graduate school Economic inequality Psychiatry Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Narcissism Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Gender role Childbirth Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Economy of the United States Inflation A Course In Miracles Avenue Q Independence Party (Iceland) Pitaten Hikikomori Triage Division of labour EastEnders Social work Palliative care Urinary incontinence Opus Dei Anorexia nervosa Paralegal Kyoto Protocol Seneca College Divorce Medicare (Canada) Clinical depression Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Public health in mainland China Canadian and American health care systems compared Conscription Dialysis Economics Terri Schiavo Management History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Far Eastern University Stroke Knots Landing St. John Ambulance Polyamory MMORPG Chronic fatigue syndrome Estoppel Henry Dunant Jessica Lynch Borderline personality disorder Alternative medicine Schizophrenia Mother Teresa Microeconomics Economy of India Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Simone Weil Combat stress reaction Emergency Medical Services Apprenticeship Grief Hypnosis Workplace democracy Drug abuse United States Army

do rn's have access to anyone's private medical information here's the situation my wife had a lesbian stalker back in college the lesbian recently graduated as an rn from the same university's health science center that my wife first saw a doctor for the pregnancy we never told anyone the due date but the lesbian called up my wife's brother lesbian had the number because she stole my wife's phone and asked if my wife is having a baby in days on august th aug was the exact due date my wife already had the baby but it was still really weird because we didn't know how she got that information my question is this can an rn look up medical history for anyone they want to or just medical history from a person at a certain hospital or what if so and if she did that this is a serious violation and i want to report her for doing it it's possible she could get access to your wife's information if she worked at the same hospital but technically speaking she is supposed to have access to the records of only the patients for whom she has direct care responsbility someone gave her access or someone looked up your wife's medical information and shared it with the rn there are federal hippa privacy laws that very specifically dictate who is to have access to records and with whom the information can be shared if this nurse has moved on from the university hospital it might be difficult to track her down but you should be able to find out who gave her the information all activities in an information system can be tracked and it would be a simple matter to track where the rn was and when and who logged onto the system and looked up your wife's information i would file a complaint with the hospital in fact i would ask for a meeting with either the ceo or the don director of nursing bring your brother who can discuss first hand the phone call conversation explain to them the background situation stalking and tell them you want some action taken against the rn if they still have some control over her and the person who allowed her to have access to the information tell them you are aware of the hippa laws look them up and be well versed you can also contact your state's nursing board and file a complaint against her the hospital will have done their investigation by then and will know when and how she got the information it could lead to her losing her rn license it's imperative that you take some action against this woman because that's the only way to stop the stalking harassment and invasion of your privacy  Plame affair Medical record HIPAA Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution Medical prescription Terri Schiavo Privacy Classified information Health insurance Infantilism Knots Landing Medicine Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Surveillance Fair Game (Scientology) Telephone tapping Neighbours Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Abortion in the United States Abortion Breastfeeding Rape Medicare (Canada) Childbirth Publicly funded medicine Roe v.

is it difficult being a registered nurse what is their minimum salary i wanted to know if it would be difficult working as a registered nurse is it a very hectic profession also i wanted to know the difference between a registered nurse and a liscence nurse what is their minimum or starting wage thanks i am a registered nurse and i would consider it to be a very hectic profession it is emotionally and physically very tiring and definitely not a profession to be undertaken lightly in a typical day i have three drug rounds to do assist with washing feeding dressing and mobilising patients liaise with other health care professionals such as physiotherapists social workers dieticians and occupational therapists i may have to prepare up to people for surgery and then care for them when they come back with all their attachments such as pain relief appliances drips catheters and monitors i may have to sort out patient discharges and make sure everything is in place for them to go home giving advice making sure wounds are ok ensuring home care is in place i will give telephone advice to people i will go on ward rounds with doctors and consultants i will do dressing changes take out and put in catheters set up pain relief applicances and take out stitches and clips i will deal with emergency admissions and refer to intensive care or emergency care teams i will do mountains of paperwork everything needs to be documented and there are computer systems that must be updated care plans must be devised i have to talk to relatives and help them with stressful news i have to deal with people after they have died and do all the physical and administrative things in a hr shift i have x minute coffee breaks and half an hour for lunch so yes i would say its hectic we only have registered nurses in the uk so unsure of what a liscenced nurse is and starting salary is obviously going to be different however hope this has been of some use to you i would advise going along to your local hospital and asking whether you can do some work experience so you can shadow a nurse and see exactly what the job entails then you will be able to see whether it is the profession for you good luck  Medicine Prostate cancer Palliative care Childbirth Dialysis Traumatic brain injury Myocardial infarction Medical prescription Mental Health Act 1983 Triage Intravenous therapy Nursing Publicly funded medicine Traditional Chinese medicine Paramedic Anesthesia Nursing home Physician Stroke Medical record Urinary incontinence Stomach cancer Transsexuality Emergency department Psychiatry Breastfeeding Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Intensive care medicine Certified Nursing Assistant Terri Schiavo Emergency Medical Services Psychiatric hospital Division of labour Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East Psoriasis Call centre Health insurance Midwifery Canadian and American health care systems compared Community emergency response team Social work Osteopathy Medicare (Canada) Chronic fatigue syndrome Ambulance Psychiatric and mental health nursing First aid General practitioner Animal testing Health profession 2005 Kashmir earthquake Cancer Clinical depression Unemployment Social rule Addiction Insulin Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Domain Name System Baseball Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Florence Nightingale International League Education in Portugal Drug abuse Coffee New Deal Registered Nurse Paralegal Hospital Chinese University of Hong Kong Occupational Therapy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Emergency medical technician Surveillance Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Ethics Hurricane Rita Salary Local anesthesia Psychotherapy National Kidney Foundation Singapore Epilepsy Public health in mainland China Chiropractic

need help to make a new resume for a job at a dentist's office im currently looking for a new job at a dentist or orthodontist office i want to go to school to become a dental hygentist so i think working at a dentist office would really help me at school i also want to have a good part time or full time job that offers benefits i havn't made a resume for about a year and don't really know how to make a proper one anymore any help would be appreciated thanks besides setting all margins to the most important criteria for setting up a professional resume besides relevant text is scanability here are some helpful tips place just below your identification header your hame address phone email address any conditional warning statement such as confidential resume do not contact current employer etc always fill in an objectives category just below the conditional warning statement and make sure that he objective will contribute to the profitability of your future employer select a mono type font such as helvetica arial courier or times roman do not select any cursive handwriting styles which cannot scanned keep font sizes within a range of to pts avoid styling text with a justified alignment keep it flushed left instead of using tabs to set up blocked text entries generate a table and use the column and row settings accordingly do not place an i d picture anywhere on the resume this is a major taboo due to discrimination issues do not place any graphic text saved as gifs onto the resume since it may be overlooked during the scanning phase list at the very end of the resume your interests which should include travel experiences language skills social interactions such as golf team sports tennis etc in conclusion the above helpful hints were designed to allow ease of scanning of your resume into pdf which can then be text captured for seach purposes by your potential employer if the original resume was created in word wordperfect or mac appleworks it can be saved as a pdf file which then can be saved as an email attachment otherwise you can simply use a scanner and scan a hard copy of the resume and then save as a pdf file failure to conform the resume to appropriate fonts and styles as outlined above will result in rejection of the resume simply due to the inability of the scanning device to properly index relevant resume entries good luck  Killian documents Typeface Gmail HTML element Portable Document Format EIA-708 TrueType Unicode CPU cache OpenDocument Apple typography Computer virus PostScript Ebook WordPerfect ALGOL 68 Google Enterprise content management PNG Plame affair Opera (web browser) E-mail spam International Phonetic Alphabet Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus HTML British national identity card Insurance Python programming language Cascading Style Sheets IPod Virtual memory Palanca Awards Windows Vista Cyrillic alphabet Medical prescription Computer Atari 8-bit family System/36 ASCII art Stopping e-mail abuse Hangul Pretty Good Privacy System/34 Mach kernel Perl E-mail Emacs Windows XP Magnetic resonance imaging Compiler optimization Microsoft Screenshot Economic inequality Index (database) Macromedia Flash Arabic alphabet Apple Computer Social Security (United States) SCO-Linux controversies Hash table Digital photography Euro Objective-C Intelligent design movement Mac OS X Blog Forth programming language Downing Street memo Anonymous remailer Stuttering Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act HyperCard AmigaOS Dot matrix printer Phishing Geographic information system Dentistry Musical Instrument Digital Interface Unicode and HTML Tennis Volleyball File format Icon programming language United Kingdom corporation tax Intellectual property Optical character recognition Unemployment Baptism Philosophy of language Customer relationship management Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Microeconomics

nursing school in us some commuinty collages teach nursing scholl in years only and in the university teach in years and the both get the same licence rn and both get master's degree is that true like i heart i'm not sure about that and what's the nature work for rn is that true she deal with patiens's poop and change the linens clean around etc i do need to know about that before i applying for nursing school thanks education training to become a registered nurse you must earn a high school diploma then complete a post secondary nursing program entrance requirements for nursing programs differ depending on the college or university generally you should graduate from high school with senior level science math and english courses be sure to contact the nursing school you are planning to attend to find out what their admission requirements are after high school you have the option of earning either a degree or diploma in nursing there are two types of degree programs the year bachelor of science degree in nursing bsn and the year associate s degree in nursing adn diploma programs take to years to complete the higher your level of education the more advantages you will have in the workforce for example some hospitals will only hire graduates who have a bachelor s degree in addition there are more advancement opportunities open to nurses with bachelor s degrees than those with associate degrees or diplomas all states require nurses to be licensed which means you must pass a national licensing exam after graduating from a nursing program working conditions nurses work in hospitals nursing homes walk in clinics prisons schools factories offices and many other places there is a movement toward community based health care so in the future there may more opportunities in public health areas nursing requires a lot of physical activity there is a great deal of standing bending and lifting it can be emotionally demanding especially if you are working with severely ill or dying patients of course it can also be a tremendously rewarding profession occupational hazards for nurses are similar to those of other health workers they include contact with patients who have infectious diseases such as hepatitis and tuberculosis and injury from instruments chemicals and gases some nurses work very irregular hours those who work in hospitals or nursing homes may work hour shifts including nights or weekends others such as those in community centers may have more regular schedules most full time nurses work between and hours a week and have between and vacation days a year job description registered nurses also known as rns are the most well known of the various types of nursing professionals they require more education than licensed practical nurses and usually take on a wider range of responsibilities many registered nurses are involved in providing direct patient care however their work might also include a variety of other duties for example they may present health information to large groups of people perform urgent procedures in an emergency department manage and instruct other nurses in a large teaching hospital or teach and do research at a university their work with patients can be divided into four general duties first they assess patients physical mental and emotional health status this involves collecting information on patients personal family and community background taking blood pressure temperature and other vital signs and performing basic physical exams next nurses help design and carry out treatment plans for patients this could mean bandaging a wound giving medications or injections coordinating treatments with other health care professionals or referring a patient to another caregiver third nurses monitor the results of treatments to see if the medical problem has been taken care of and to make sure that the patient is satisfied finally nurses keep patients and their families informed about their medical options and educate them about health issues like nutrition personal hygiene and lifestyle choices nurses also maintain records such as patients charts and supervise licensed practical nurses and other health support staff nurses have many options they can choose to specialize in certain areas such as surgery assisting in the operating room pediatrics working with children critical care working in the intensive care unit psychiatric nursing working with the mentally ill or geriatrics working with older people nurses can work with individuals families or communities i hope this helps

what is required of fire fighters specifically i am interested in becoming a fire fighter but i want details i will be getting my aa in health and sciences next summer and i know that will help but what other schooling is required of firefighters to enter their school also what are the physical requirements do you need to be able to bench a certain amount or run two miles in a certain amount of time what will give me an edge over other applicants if possible cite references and websites where you got your info please if not thats cool too thanks education training to become a firefighter applicants must pass rigorous written oral physical and medical tests including vision hearing and fitness assessments these tests measure the applicants agility strength manual dexterity and in some cases fear of heights and enclosed spaces completion of high school or equivalent is usually required although not always a requirement completion of college courses in fire fighting or fire science can make give you a competitive advantage when applying for jobs and help you obtain a higher score on the written examination and in the interview firefighting programs are offered at colleges and vocational and technical institutes across the country most programs require years to complete and lead to an associate degree while others take less time to complete and result in a certificate of completion a few schools offer year bachelor s degrees in firefighting these programs may be especially useful for those hoping to end up in senior administrative positions some fire departments have formal apprenticeship programs these programs combine on the job training and experience with in class technical instruction apprenticeships typically take about years to complete but the advantage of these programs is that students get to earn a wage while they learn applicants for firefighter positions must also have a valid driver s license and a spotless driving record however the class of license required varies from area to area cpr and basic first aid certification are also required but they may be taken after you're hired applicants must also have a high school diploma and can't have a criminal record once they have been hired it is common for new firefighters to have to complete a training and probationary period the initial training period usually lasts for several weeks while the probationary period can last up to a year during this time they are thoroughly trained tested and drilled to ensure they can cope with the demands of the job experience as a volunteer firefighter is also helpful it is highly recommended that you participate in a fitness and strength training program prior to applying for a firefighting position strength and stamina are needed to withstand the extreme temperatures that firefighters must work in and when carrying fire hoses or injured people contact your local fire station to find out more about firefighting the exact requirements in your area and to learn where to apply  Education in Australia Education in the People's Republic of China Nurse Software engineering Education in Hong Kong Education in Germany GED Juris Doctor Master's degree Teacher Law school Dog agility College admissions Lawyer Education in Taiwan Community college High school College Paramedic Associate's degree Professor Education in Romania Explosive material IB Diploma Programme Education in the Republic of Ireland Education in Malaysia Martial art Fire fighting A-level Paralegal Barrister Education in Japan Glossary of firefighting terms Australian Qualifications Framework Pilot certification in the United States Firefighter Physical therapy Ambulance Software testing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Columbia University Advanced Placement Program National Certificate of Educational Achievement Education in Singapore Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology SAT Conscription Education in Sweden Education Appeal Affirmative action Junior Certificate Community emergency response team Quizbowl Architect Higher education in Japan Psychology Jet engine General practitioner Dentistry University of Central Florida Boy Scouts of America Chinese University of Hong Kong Unemployment Student loan Medicine UCAS Test (student assessment) Charles William Eliot Emergency Medical Services Welding Scottish Qualifications Authority Hypnosis Chiropractic First aid Bologna process Trinity College, Dublin Homeschooling Electrical engineering No Child Left Behind Act Education in Austria Far Eastern University United States Air Force Academy Memorial University of Newfoundland Doctor of Philosophy Spark plug Doctorate

if you got fired from a job is it a good idea to list that job on your resume i worked there for a year and a half just wondering if it's ethical to list the job this is a tough one a lot of big companies will only verify that someone was employed or not some might offer if the employee left in good standing or not but companies tend to be afraid of liability so they will not offer details at all find out what your company's policy is heck you might even try calling as if you were a potential employer to see what they say or offer when asked about your status and standing with the company i'm calling to verify employment for so and so i have here that she worked from start date to end date did she leave in good standing with the company may we ask why her employment ended with you those answers will give you an idea about how you will handle this having a gap of years on your resume could do damage so you really want to know if they will only verify employment or if they give some information if you do list the job you must be truthful about why you left you can find a way to put the most positive professional spin on it my leadership at company a and i could not come to an agreement on how duty should be performed and in the end it was better if we parted ways my employment was terminated i learned so much from the experience and would do such and thus differently you can't bad mouth the leadership or the company it must be discussed very professionally and what you got from the experience for sure don't list a supervisor unless they can give you a positive reference i can't believe how many people list references that don't actually have anything positive to say about the former employee if the company is gabby about why you were let go you might look into hr laws in your state there tends to be legal limitations on what they are allowed to discuss and if your former company is crossing those boundaries then you have some action you can take after all of this i think it would probably be worth your time and money to work with a career counselor dbm is someone i've worked with in the past and found to be tremendously helpful they aren't cheap but this is your career you are talking about here  Plame affair Theory of conduct Scientology beliefs and practices Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ethics Mediation Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Social rule Annuity Graduate school Business ethics Civil rights Corporate governance Call centre Outsourcing Unemployment Software engineering Life insurance Goodness and value theory Contract Steve Jobs Poker jargon Insurance Milton H.

how do i make a smooth transition from a day job to an all nighter one im considering switching from a job from am pm to one that's only days a week hr shifts from pm am how do i make a smooth transition on my sleeping and eating patterns take some time in between to get your body adjusted to sleeping during the day for a couple days try staying up as late as you can then try sleeping during the day sometimes it helps to take meds like tylenol pm to assist with am sleep also reduce any noise and stimuli while you're trying to sleep when staying up at night try not too consume caffeine after am can be harder to fall asleep if you do the eating patterns are a little harder to adjust because you flip flop back and forth when you're off when i work at night i eat something light when i wake up i usually eat my dinner by midnight but no later than am as soon as i get home i'll eat a light breakfast food then sleep you're gonna snack so try to keep it healthy during my days off i tend to eat later in the day but not as late as midnight unless i slept all day and plan to be up all night  Sleep Breakfast Meal Insomnia Mattress Caffeine Delayed sleep phase syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome Narcolepsy Atkins Nutritional Approach Hypoglycemia Out-of-body experience Breastfeeding Kitchen Fecal incontinence Dream Dieting Cat Sleep disorder Carpal tunnel syndrome Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Obesity Tooth The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sleep debt Mercury Atlas 6 Nashville Skyline Asterix and the Laurel Wreath Spider Cuisine of Denmark Cyndi Lauper STS-61 Nutrition Stomach cancer Thermoregulation Guinea pig Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Common cold The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Coffee Light pollution Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Chocolate Public transport Polyphasic sleep Tea Airport Hangover Hypnosis Snack food Adjustable gastric band WNNX (FM) Computer animation Sukkot Goldfish Healthy eating Pancake Eating Whale Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Folic acid Paracetamol Lights Out (radio show) Gemini 7 Philip J.

is this even relevant rn lpn or cna's please i am emabarking on a career change i worked as a speech therapist assisant in a public school and want to become an rn i want to work as a cna while i am in nursing school i just completed my training and am writing my resume to start applying for jobs where i live they hire cna's in hospitals w o experience so this is where i am focusing my job search efforts i included my previous speech job as part of employment history on my resume but i wonder if i should include some volunteer work i did related to speech and hearing i provided free hearing screenings to industrial workers and also volunteered in a preschool speech language amd pre literacy program should i include this on my cna resume or would a don feel that i don't know how to identify relavent experience to put on a resume since these experiences aren't directly related to health care let me say that i think it is marvelous that you devoted so much to the community yes there is a spot on your resume for which you may mention these things volunteer work commitees not everyone puts it on their resume as many of us are taught not to be too wordy or too lengthly when applying however as a rn myself with over years of experience in acute care working with many different kinds of patients including those who are speech impaired i consider it an asset to have someone on staff who may be able to offer insight and experience while putting together a plan of care for such individuals you could also mention it during the interview process if you aren't comfortable putting it on your resume if i may also add that anyone who volunteers for anything shows enthusiasm for the needs at hand if i were the nurse mgr or don i would take note of this and be glad to have you i wish you well  Nurse Milton H.

academic or actual experience do we place too much emphasis on academic study to the detriment of practical experience for example an nhs degree nurse can exit university proudly holding his or her peice of paper and take charge of a ward with little or no practical experience including being 'in charge of' auxiliary nurses who may have had or more years experience of direct hands on patient care which would you prefer looking after you or your relative and why i want experience over academic theres nothing like an experienced nurse cooor joking aside i was in accident and emergency last week after collapsing in work the doctor who looked about found nothing wrong with me my future mother in law who was one of the first paramedics in england and seen it all from ira bombings to nightclub stabbings and recieved an mbe for her services was able to tell me what happened over the phone and she was spot on nd years houseman had'nt a clue thank christ i was'nt brought in with a steel bar sticking out of my head i would have been sent home with some painkillers  General practitioner Nurse Juris Doctor Paramedic Mental Health Act 1983 Medical record Ambulance Emergency Medical Services Triage Physician St. John Ambulance Medicine Publicly funded medicine Doctorate Paralegal EastEnders Chinese University of Hong Kong Miscarriage of justice Quizbowl Emergency medical technician Health insurance Church of Christ, Scientist Clergy Midwifery The Empty Child Graduate school Pittsburgh Steelers Stroke Childbirth Medical University of South Carolina Medical prescription Traumatic brain injury Terri Schiavo Columbia University Migraine Far Eastern University Software engineering Physical therapy Public health in mainland China Nursing Emergency department British National Party Nursing theory Tag Sigmund Freud Education in Portugal Academia Alternative medicine Psychiatric and mental health nursing Uppsala University Plagiarism Reiki Spider-Man 2 The Catholic University of America College Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Guinea pig Education in the United States Breastfeeding Academic degree Palliative care Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Dafydd Williams Lawyer Shaggy dog story Milton H.

are doctors now lazy and don't care about patients hello doctor i've been having pain and discomfort in my entire body daily for about years now and some days it gets so bad that i can't get out of bed i have my good days but most of the time it's hard for me to function in daily life and i can't do all the things i want to do i also get headaches severe period cramps lightheadedness and fatigue i get sharp pains in my stomach and back that sometimes bring me to my knees i'm a pretty tough year old but have cried several times from the pain and feeling helpless also over the counter meds like tylenol and midol don t help me at all berry here's some paxil doc hello doctor i've had serious stomach problems for about years including sharp pains discomfort frequent gas diarrhea and constipation i eat healthy most of the time and don't eat fast food i think my stomach problems have resulted from my teenage partying phase where i drank and did drugs i have quit these bad habits but have continued to have problems berry here's some imodium ad doc i feel these doctors don t take me seriously and they just hand me a useless prescription without running tests asking me questions or even giving advice about diet and exercise or what could be causing my problems at such a young age are my problems too complicated and they don t want to deal with them do they think i m lying or imagining it where can i find good healthcare with a caring doctor who will take me seriously and actually try to help in the meantime i ve been self medicating with loritabs for over a year because it s the only thing i ve found that has eased my pain and made it so i can function and have a normal life hi berry i can tell you honestly that doctors care and are not lazy the first thing you have to realize is that doctors are not perfect that illusion about them or anyone else can be the source of much pain they are not the healer just his asistants from their end they also can't talk negative about themselves because that will break their relationship with you the second thing is your relationship with medical persons is much like that of a school teacher or any other professional the things you think and say to them can positive for your benifit or negative and push you away from them so go easy on the criticism that doesn't build relationship you need relationship with a doctor who has relationship with the healer it sounds to me like you are getting symptomatic treatment you say you have pain and they give you paxil you say you have diarriah and they give you some imodium that is because while interviewing a patient a medical person is comparing what you say with disease symptoms he has learned about sort of like a mechanic analizing an engine which you are not of course i was a navy hospital corpsman for five years and and did a tour of duty in viet nam i've worked sick calls i suggest you find that good doctor and be careful not to mention symptoms that you are not presently expirencing that will cut down on false leads and help focus the interview i resigned medicine as a career because of an incident at sick call a certain man came to sick call on a regular basis with a marid of compaints it didn't take much of this before he was labeled a hypocondriac by my fellow medics i didn't appreciate their fun at his expense what the healer reviealed to me was he is not looking for medicine he's looking for me  Fecal incontinence Prostate cancer Coeliac disease Addiction Hypoglycemia Diarrhea Migraine Chronic fatigue syndrome Pneumonia Urinary incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Traumatic brain injury Osteoarthritis Psoriasis Anorexia nervosa Traditional Chinese medicine Chiropractic First aid Decompression sickness Health insurance Breastfeeding Alternative medicine Charles Darwin's illness Milton H.

what is the best way for a hospital nurse staff rn to develop or improve time management skills especially when you have understaffing emergent situations and nonstop interruptions to name a few i dont think there is an ideal way to develop time management skills on the ward it is just such an unstable and ever changing environment what i do is try and create a basic plan in my head at the start of the shift and use those as a cornerstone for example start the shift at am after handover and spend minutes just going around introducing yourself to your patients and make sure there are no immediate needs for example no one needs to sit up for breakfast no one needs to have their dentures in no one needs a commode no one needs to be reminded of nil by mouth restrictions prior to surgery that sort of thing then a few minutes to make note of any important things that must be done on schedule for example scans xrays surgical procedures discharges these are things that must be done at the right time then at am i will do my first drugs round making note of any iv antibiotics that need to be given and at what time more things that must be done at right time so in this way you are building up a plan for the day you have things to do at certain times prioritise your workload if you have a dressing to do assess its urgency is it something that you need to do straight away or can it wait until you have a quieter spot in the day when you have no scheduled tasks to perform dont be tempted to always run to the phone when it rings as this causes interuptions and usually there is a problem on the end of the phone which will take even more time allow others to answer the phone too ask relatives to pick a representative to phone the ward for news of patients that way you can reduce the number of repeated calls about an individual patient every shift will end with you thinking there are things you havent done but hopefully by prioritising your workload the things you havent done will be the least important jobs and i'm sure the night staff dont mind being left with those  Triage Publicly funded medicine Nurse Psychiatric hospital Medicine Stroke Call centre Traumatic brain injury Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Social rule Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hip fracture Certified Nursing Assistant Extreme Programming Emergency Medical Services Mental Health Act 1983 First aid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Windows 2000 Myocardial infarction Strategic management Thread (computer science) Stomach cancer ITV Dialysis Ambulance Epilepsy Prostate cancer Replacement joint Pneumonia Medicare (Canada) Microeconomics Traditional Chinese medicine Shaggy dog story Emergency department Jayant Patel Cancer Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Aortic dissection DragonFly BSD Air traffic controller About a Boy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) RISC Medical record Breastfeeding Psychosurgery Malignant melanoma Psychiatry Abortion Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Cornelia Rau Norway national football team Patent Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans National Institutes of Health Mach kernel Information Technology Infrastructure Library History of intersex surgery Health insurance Emergency medical technician Ariel (Firefly episode) Pittsburgh Steelers Field hospital Childbirth Capitalism CPU design Game programmer L4 microkernel family National Health Service Consciousness Physical therapy Organ transplant Sleep apnea Dentures Free trade Hypoglycemia Rational Unified Process Getting Things Done Benchmark (computing) Air traffic control Scrubs Palm OS Obstetrics UK telephone numbering plan Prolactinoma Public policy Milton H.

medical assistant how do you like your medical assitant job and what do you do as a medical assistant i'm not a medical assistant but i have seen many people be mislead by medical assisting schools it breaks my heart to see the schools take k from students and the students are lucky to find jobs for an hour they lead some people to believe that the opportunities for employment are limitless more and more medical assistants are being pushed behind a desk in the same amount of time you could become an lpn and have more opportunities for employment and better pay plus you have the option of continuing your education as an rn i just completed a six week cna program and am applying for jobs when i look through the hospital job postings cna's are paid as much as medical assistants i find that so sad i paid for my cna they paid it makes me want to cry i'm sure its different in other areas i live in nebraska i understand that some people just don't like poop and the messy stuff that goes with nursing nothing wrong with that but if this is why you are looking in to medical assisting look into respiratory therapy or radiation technology if you still want to be a medical assistant go to a community college not one of the tech schools that advertise all the time on daytime tv i really hope i didn't insult you or your career plans i just hate seeing people conned  Nurse Medicine Certified Nursing Assistant University of Central Florida Columbia University October 2005 in Malaysia and Singapore Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Dot-com Seneca College Health insurance Unemployment Paralegal Juris Doctor 2005 Bali bombings Childbirth Chinese University of Hong Kong Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Medical Assistant Pitaten The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio Medical school Barbara Boxer Clinical depression Myocardial infarction Walt Disney World College Program July 2005 in Malaysia and Singapore Affirmative action Neighbours Kwantlen University College Student loan Scholarship University of Michigan Prostate cancer General practitioner Georgia Institute of Technology Psoriasis Stroke Poker jargon Education in Portugal Medical University of South Carolina Alpha Phi Education in Australia University of Connecticut Psychiatric hospital Patsy Mink Urinary incontinence Nursing home University of California, Los Angeles Johns Hopkins University Chiropractic Stomach cancer Pneumonia Miami-Dade County Public Schools American University Milton H.
