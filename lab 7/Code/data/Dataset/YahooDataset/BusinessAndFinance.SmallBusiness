in construction what is builder's risk i know that i have to get builder's risk and give a copy of it to the bank but what exatly does it cover what is it i know absolutely nothing about it and our accounts payable person just left does the general contractor usually cover the bill for this or does the owner does it end once the buildings complete builder's risk insurance is designed to protect the contractor and the owner of the property from property loss since buildings are so much more vulnerable to things like weather theft etc when they're under construction usually a builder's risk insurance contract will specify the city other property owner the contractor and any subcontractors as all being insured whether the contractor or the city is responsible for getting the insurance set up will depend on the contract it's not always one or the other if you the contractor are responsible for getting the insurance you can add it to the cost of the contract in many cases the city's existing insurance policy will include builder's risk insurance especially for small projects so you won't have to do anything each project will have its own builder's risk coverage  Insurance Construction Life insurance Risk management Health insurance Derivative (finance) Title insurance Property (ownership right) Home insurance Auto insurance Mortgage Annuity Variable universal life insurance HIPAA Intellectual property Mechanics lien Commodity markets Estoppel Contract Social Security (United States) Leasing Natural monopoly Liability insurance Trademark Capital accumulation Password Anarchism and capitalism Government debt Richmond-Airport-Vancouver Line Lloyd's of London Medical malpractice Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Allodial title Bank fraud Microeconomics Corporate finance Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act Workers' compensation Pennsylvania Railroad Institutional fund management Nuclear power Publicly funded medicine ITV Robert Moses National Health Service Wayne Corporation Security guard Financial services Copyright Trust (Law) USA Crew Exploration Vehicle Floppy disk Bond Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Unemployment Inheritance tax Information Services Procurement Library Spyware E-mail spam Classified information Credit card Mutual fund National Insurance Copyright law of the United Kingdom Anarcho-capitalism Non-aggression principle National Flood Insurance Program SCO-Linux controversies Compensation of employees Identity theft U.S. public debt John Hancock Tower Rational Unified Process United States Postal Service Surety bond Three Gorges Dam General aviation British national identity card Finance American individualist anarchism Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Big Dig BAE Systems US health reform under FDR Eliot Spitzer Mergers and acquisitions Health care in the United States Slander and libel Model aircraft Unemployment benefit Extreme Programming Hercules Linton Bank Space Shuttle program Monetary policy Dynamic Systems Development Method

has your business failed if so why was it lack of demand not enough sales i have had involvement with businesses that have failed in the past lack of demand resulting in lack of sales is the primary cause of most business failure if you have good sales revenue you can make mistakes in other areas of your business but eventually make the enterprise a success if given enough time on the other hand if you have insufficient sales revenue your business will almost certainly fail no matter how brilliantly managed the other aspects of your business are many businesses fail because they cannot or will not react to changes in the marketplace one example is the payphone business which has been decimated by the widespread use of cell phones another example is the small office supply stationary store which has been largely killed off by the national office supply chains like officemax and staples as well as places like costco and sam's club another big killer of small businesses is over expansion a business is successful but thinks it needs to expand in order to capitalize on market opportunities it hires new employees rents additional space and starts to think like a big company greatly increasing overhead revenue does not increase in proportion to costs and eventually the company finds it is in over its head i don't have the stats to prove it but i think that the most common time for a business to close its doors is just after it has greatly expanded  Wal-Mart Microeconomics Electronic commerce Costco Economy of Russia Mergers and acquisitions Privatization Capitalism Management information system Monetary policy Prices of production Surplus value Supply and demand Bulk vending Unemployment IBM Tesco Monopoly Law of value Customer relationship management Strategic management Economics Asian financial crisis OfficeMax Berkshire Hathaway Asset Eaton's Labour economics Network effect Intellectual property Sears Holdings Corporation Tax Outsourcing Taxicab Economy of Africa Corporate governance Supply-side economics FairTax Cable television Airline Marvel Comics Target Corporation Payphone Hash table Floppy disk Trademark United Parcel Service Xerox Hydrogen economy Vendor Managed Inventory Electronic Arts History of the United States (1918-1945) Extreme Programming Publishing Criticisms of socialism Economy of India Management Monetarism Manitoba Hydro Price discrimination Dot-com Industrial Revolution CPU design Venture capital Intermediate consumption South African Breweries NEC Corporation Pharmaceutical company Retailer Natural monopoly Rational Unified Process Business ethics Software patent debate New Deal Citigroup Corporate finance Apple II family Agriculture in Australia Tariff Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Economic history of Canada Monopsony Filling station Fuel cell UK Singles Chart Microsoft French Second Republic Economy of Poland Nintendo Entertainment System

anybody know where i can find angel investors silent partners of sorts to help me open my restaurant i want to open a franchise restaurant in lake havasu city az awesome potential to make huge money but i can't get a business loan i need a silent partner or an angel investor can anyone steer me in the right direction every investor worth his her salt will require from you a business plan for your restaurant firstly if you have no experience in the restaurant business i'd advise that you work in restaurants for the next six months or so doing everything from bussing tables and washing dishes to waiting tables and cooking if they'll allow you back there and if you have the skills this will give you some of the work experience that you'll need to understand and run a restaurant profitably if this is your first business venture i would strongly recommend that you talk to a business counselor before you do anything especially spend money i'd call the local office of score go to http www score org and input your zip code to find the chapter nearest you the advice is free ask for someone who has a background in restaurants and they'll try their best to match you with the right counselor the counselor at score will most likely advise you to write a business plan which is very good advice because it will force you to dig out all of the start up details and the costs of starting a restaurant and force you to also understand all of the aspects of this business including the customers you'll concentrate on your market and how you'll get them to find out and want to come to your fabulous restaurant the location of the restaurant is important but doesn't make it successful to prove that all you have to do is walk down a street in your town where there are several nice restaurants all in a row and you'll find one or two that are empty while the others are very busy it has to do with menu ambiance and your reputation at the beginning and over time you also have to have food handling licenses the right zoning the right city and county licenses and permits and you have to be skilled at negotiating with your landlord about who'll stand the cost of the build out or the changes to the premises to make it ready for your look and feel you also have to worry about the normal business planning and management issues related to starting up any business take a look and read some of the articles at http www ychange com small business consulting articles html especially the ones about a business plan and starting a business also try their blog and their bulletin board hope this helped  Restaurant Warren Buffett Extreme Programming Privatization OpenDocument Lloyd's of London Bulk vending X Window System Microsoft Mutual fund Mozilla Firefox Venture capital Mergers and acquisitions Corporate governance Software patent debate Strategic management United States Postal Service Citigroup Bank Electronic commerce Economics Microcredit Investment bank Kitchen Microeconomics Domain Name System Unicode Delta Air Lines Software engineering Common Unix Printing System Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Animal Crossing Thomas Paine K' SAS System Poker jargon Religious Society of Friends TransUnion Enron Corporation Scientology beliefs and practices Information Services Procurement Library Breastfeeding OpenOffice.org United Airlines McDonald's America Online Cyrus S.

should i return the deposit part i have a children's party business and we send out clowns and magicians to birthday parties i previously posted a question about if i should return deposits to customers when the entertainer gets lost and the client does not answer the phone to give directions the response is if the entertainer gets lost its the enterainer's fault and the deposit should be returned i want to rephrase the question what if the client offers a wrong address or bad directions assume we hold the spot for the client we get a mapquest and double check on yahoo maps we always check with sources because sometimes they are wrong we get directions and drive out to an address and it turns out the client misspelled something gave the wrong zipcode or the wrong address so the enterainer cannot complete the party question when its the clients fault for giving a bad wrong misspelled address should they get their deposit back thanks for me it depends on several things including what your actual out of pocket expenses were and what you have to show the client provided you the wrong information if you had to book the entertainer and your being billed for that expense explain that to the client there is also a big difference if the client wrote out the wrong directions or if you took them down over the phone one way you have proof they gave the wrong directions the other way its he said she said at best if it was me regardless for the sake of goodwill for the business i would keep what ever part of the deposit i needed to cover the actual cost i incurred even if that ment keeping all the deposit i would then offer to rebook the even in a future date at a greatly reduced cost or even at cost sometimes good businesses have to make up for other peoples mistakes that whole customer is always right thing while i think both you and i know that isnt always the case sometimes it just makes sense to act as if its true course there are some people that all the appologies and explainations in the world arent going to smooth things over if you are sure its their fault and have proof you did everything to fulfill your end of the contract then i personally would stick to the contract if for some reason you don't have a written contract or don't have the clients sign initial verify the information you have for their event you might consider doing so in the future having your t's crossed and i's dotted is always the best policy take care of the problem before its a problem course all this is just my opinion i have know idea what the actual legal ramifications could be for you if you refuse to give back any or part of the deposit if you are concerned about that in anyway you should best speak to an attorney i was only thinging about how you could best deal with a disgruntled customer while keeping a good reputation for your business  Insurance Plame affair CPU cache Contract Scientology beliefs and practices Extreme Programming Domain Name System Intellectual property Theodicy Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Password Trademark Credit card E-mail spam Life insurance Microeconomics Divorce Social rule Corporate governance Poker jargon Law of value Customer relationship management Ethics Philosophy of language Information Services Procurement Library Health insurance United States Postal Service Determinism Gmail National Kidney Foundation Singapore Abortion debate 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines British national identity card Biblical inerrancy Voice over IP U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Short selling C programming language Floppy disk Appeal Infantilism Internet fraud Best Buy Outsourcing Mach kernel Glen Jacobs Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Intelligent design Annuity Slander and libel Killian documents Business ethics FairTax Surveillance Identity theft Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Cheating in Counter-Strike Prices of production Current teachings of Prem Rawat Adoption GED Philosophy of mathematics Epistemology Bank Halting problem Goodness and value theory 2005 United States Grand Prix Enterprise content management Information Technology Infrastructure Library Katelyn Faber Consensus decision-making Auto insurance Kasparov versus The World Public-key cryptography Nicomachean Ethics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Avenue Q Ted Kennedy Cyprus dispute Lawyer Creationism Solar cell Transformation problem AppleTalk A Course In Miracles Sin Phishing Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) PRINCE2

any ideas on how to buy out another person's business operating in the negative i have an acquaintance and long time rival who owns two nail salons recently i joined her after her entire staff walked out of one of her salons she has relocated to an old location after being evicted from her previous space initially my thoughts were to serve in a capacity to help her rebuild her clientele and make some extra cash but she is now asking for my assistance with managing and financially supporting her business the biggest concern is that i know that she has not been paying creditors on time the landlord came by to collect rent month not including utility and supply expenses she assured me that the equipment in the salon is paid for it would be great to get into this business but it could be months maybe even years before it is ever profitable like it was she is in debt and at risk to lose everything what would be a good way to acquire the business and with out creating any type of partnership simple you offer her a sweet deal and you pick up a sweet deal at the same time she is bout to go belly up can't pay bills is behind to close her doors will destroy her life even personal life and she will have to go find a job something that is not easy to do today you seek to remove your competition to gain that much more business yet don't have the cash flow to buy her out but she's not a threat if she is in the negative so offer to just absorb her company as is bills and all of course sit down and check them all out first take some hits but make sure no hidden owed somewhere but as you absorb her and her bills she is no longer the owner nor partner nor any ownership at all but is now your employee or even head nail tech sounds like she is a good nail tech to get the business but is not a business person who can run the numbers aces in their places put her where she belongs doing nails now you have help assistance still the only owner have doubled in size for almost nothing down removed the competition and even better absorbed them and the customer count also she can do nails and you can go grow the business more instead of being stuck doing nails yourself saves her from bankruptcy and allows you to grow win win  Credit card Enron Corporation Warren Buffett United Kingdom corporation tax Capital accumulation Microeconomics Bank Donald Trump Security (finance) Corporation Great Depression FairTax Bond Privatization Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mergers and acquisitions Money Mortgage Dot-com Corporate finance Deflation (economics) Poker jargon Annuity Mutual fund Airline Corporate governance Economy of the United States American individualist anarchism Investment bank Debt Blackjack Estoppel Leasing Outsourcing Delta Air Lines Supply and demand CPU cache Bankruptcy Air New Zealand Taxation in the United States Berkshire Hathaway History of the United States (1918-1945) Aerial (dance move) Bulk vending Oakland Athletics Arbitrage Gambling Canadian National Railway Interest Stock Economy of Africa Finance Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Betting (poker) Derivative (finance) SCO-Linux controversies Commodore International Internet fraud AT&T Inflation Monetary policy Wayne Corporation Tax Temasek Holdings Venture capital Electronic commerce Keynesian economics Short selling Bank fraud Hercules Linton Ford Motor Company Eric Bischoff Personal finance MCI Natural monopoly Toronto-Dominion Bank Mach kernel Concurrent estate Economy of Russia Income trust Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Rupert Murdoch Cooperative Boston and Lowell Railroad Amway Boston Red Sox Information Technology Infrastructure Library Surveillance Citigroup Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code

through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for profit venture even sba does not give out grants from the sba website http www sba gov mostrequesteditems con faq html the u s small business administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs see http www sba gov financing for more information while sba does offer some grant programs these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management technical or financial assistance these grants generally support non profit organizations intermediary lending institutions and state and local governments here is a listing of federal grants for small businesses see if there is any available for individuals for starting a business there's none http pls portal catalog browse benef rpt show most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements e g minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from dot grant disadvantaged business enterprises short term lending program grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities grant women's business ownership assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train

is starting an e bay business as lucrative as they would have you believe or is it just a handy second income is it worth contemplating as a source of main income if products are sourced at the right price i don't think it is worthwhile if you are planning on selling lots of small value items a point touched on in st answer by vanessa there is little profit there and it can almost not be worth it when you consider the time and effort involved the overheads are surprisingly high mainly ebay listing fees ebay final value fees ebays cut when your item sells and paypal fees a lot of people also refer to risks and the negative aspects of buying on ebay but lets not forget selling can have its difficulties to for the most simplest transaction you can receive endless e mails and complications from the buyer for every or so customers you will probably get difficult one the other thing to be aware of is how time consuming it is taking digital photos of your items setting up auctions replying to auction questions and customers packaging posting etc it all starts to add up and you begin to feel like there is not enough hours in the day especially if you have a ful time job my advice is if you are selling on e bay go for higher value items that have a good chance of selling where you can make a good profit margin this won't tie you up all week long you should give it a try and see what works for you the experience you gain quickly will make you aware of the kind of routine you could manage for having an ebay business  Internet fraud Electronic commerce Auction Arbitrage Illegal drug trade Ra (board game) Amazon.com MMORPG Live 8 The Apprentice 2 Neopets Citigroup Islamic banking Marketing Surplus value Tax Productive and unproductive labour Advance fee fraud Something Awful Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Mutual fund Extreme Programming Capitalism Supply and demand Capital accumulation Privatization Bulk vending Mergers and acquisitions PayPal Labor theory of value Economics Price discrimination Short selling Insurance Wal-Mart Mortgage Public good Dot-com Gross domestic product $ale of the Century Commodore International United Kingdom corporation tax Monetary policy EverQuest FairTax Final Fantasy XI Subscription business model Grey market Predatory lending Cable television Monopoly Relationship marketing Health insurance Commodity Flat tax Strategic management Stock Investment bank Venture capital Inflation Sears Holdings Corporation Prices of production Surveillance Tariff Google Breastfeeding Loss leader Warranty Bank Poker jargon Progressive tax Apple Computer Retailer Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Gmail Outsourcing Sampling (music) Labour economics Business-to-consumer electronic commerce Anarchism and capitalism ITunes Music Store Intellectual property Halliburton Margin (finance) RuneScape skills Warren Buffett MapleStory Inventory RuneScape Scientology beliefs and practices Electronic Arts Pricing

how to convince parents to let me work on business long story short i'm recently got funding for a video game company i co founded this sounds childish but my parents will freak out because i quit college over it i can go back to school however i have no intent to a business requires many more hours than college so if i was lazy i would pick college i love learning i read over pages of business books a day and i have a crystal clear vision of what i want to do in the next years to come and that does not require a degree i want to bring this to parents so that they don't get hurt however i'm that my decision to quit school is correct thanks i'm out space brief accomplishments without parental assistance my parents are not entrepreneurs started my first business at selling collectible cards later started a inspirational magazine for young entrepreneurs and grew to columnists a year ago started consulting firm for charities i grew the firm to about people at you are an adult unless they were funding your college and you misused their funds there really isn't anything they can do about it though i understand that you want to break it to them gently even if you didn't need one to get the funding you got i'd write up a business plan always a good idea with a new business anyway and present the plan to them when you talk to them so that they can see this is not just a whim and that you are serious and are looking not only at short term goals but long term goals as well also join your city's small business association if having connections there would be helpful to you some business classes even if you don't intend to major in anything might be something you think about taking down the road to get information from experienced people it seems you have the drive to make something like this work if you have the right tools and connections you should go far good luck  Extreme Programming Transactional analysis Pitaten Theory of conduct Consensus decision-making Requirements analysis Enterprise content management Education Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Milton H.

hi how do i legalize a name for a business to make it my own and make sure nobody has it already thanks the most common way of doing this is through filing for a dba stands for doing business as in your county part of filing for the dba includes doing research on whether anyone else is using the business name s in which you're interested and in what capacity getting your dba and business name is usually separate from and done before you get a business license at the city or county level i'm assuming that you don't want to incorporate here as that is more complicated as somebody else mentioned you can use a name that somebody else is already using as long as you are not selling a competing or similar product service in the same market area so for example is you want to name your sandwich shop the red onion and somebody else has a produce stand called the red onion you're cool however i suggest that you name your business differently if possible to avoid any possibility of litigation some businesses especially the big ones will go after you with corporate lawyers and deep pockets and even if you're in the right it's not worth the fight you can get somebody to file your dba for you online in many cases try http www filedba com good luck  Trademark Copyleft Attorney at Law Apple Computer Stardock Microsoft Lawsuit Retailer Free trade SCO-Linux controversies Hamburger Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Electronic commerce Mediation Warez Lawyer Nuclear power IBM Insurance Natural monopoly Corporation McDonald's Pretty Good Privacy Enron Corporation Unix Software patent debate Oracle database Tort reform Recording Industry Association of America Citigroup Court system of Canada SCO v.

are you business owner i will like to know what mistakes you made at the begining of your busines and later which it was painfull i was a business owner my first lesson was about going into business with people who are not qualified do not give people the benefit of the doubt the team needs to be solid and all need to contribute as planned create documents and have people sign them we had a generic business plan but things did not line up as we planned everyone says location is everything and that's true i believe that's why our deli bakery did not work out we had established a great clientele but not enough to stay afloat also you need to protect yourself and have a back up plan in case things go sour i think i'm going to lose my properties because things went sour we had a general partnership although its more work form a corporation or something to protect your assets also have enough money set aside to cover the first year or two while you are building your business good luck  Trust (Law) USA Trademark Capitalism Intellectual property Corporation 401(k) Construction Life insurance Enron Corporation Dividend Insurance SCO-Linux controversies Contract Wal-Mart Trust (Law) non-USA Value system Leasing Donald Trump United Kingdom corporation tax Corporate personhood Slander and libel 2000 Australian Grand Prix Privatization Warren Buffett Pretty Good Privacy Limited liability company New York Giants Treaty of Waitangi Property law Income trust Ownership Offshoring Copyright law of the United Kingdom Small business Sears Holdings Corporation PRINCE2 Easement Information Technology Infrastructure Library Anarchism and capitalism Capital accumulation Tax Property (ownership right) Microeconomics Berkshire Hathaway Economy of Russia Babe Ruth Enterprise content management American Motors Copyright Copyleft Chinatown, Los Angeles, California Bank fraud Extreme Programming 1919 World Series Incorporation (business) School of Salamanca Trade secret Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Bread Public good Mortgage Institutional fund management Security (finance) Business Corporate governance Universal Studios Woodward's Numerology Guild Carolina Panthers Law of value Public domain Anarchism and society Real estate developer Goodness and value theory Samuel Goldwyn Financial services Amway Salary cap Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Digital rights management Corporate finance New Deal Bretton Woods system Productive and unproductive labour Wealth Unlawful combatant Kelo v.

ebay money order question ok i want to buy a item off ebay and i am goin to pay by money order what i want to know is how does the seller know where to ship the item and how would u use the money order to buy it ebay automatically sends an email to the seller and buyer stating the item has been sold and shows names addresses make sure the seller accepts money orders if the auction doesn't state this and you're not sure ask the seller i know a lot of people will recommend paypal me being one of them but i realize some buyers like yourself have your reasons for not doing so and that's ok there are a lot of sellers that refuse to use paypal too the best way to tell if a seller is honest is to check their feedback if the comments have legitimate complaints and an unusually high amount of negative feedback then keep looking always trust your intuition if something smells fishy make sure you buy from someone within your country so if the transaction goes sour you have more legal grounds to get your money back take into consideration the total cost final sale and shipping to see if it's in line with what you're willing to spend before bidding make sure you read the product description thoroughly before buying so you understand exactly what you're getting how the seller ships when they ship and how much shipping is going to cost if you have questions about the item contact the seller to see what their response time is like if they don't bother responding at all then you'll have a harder time getting hold of them if something goes wrong contact the seller before bidding to make sure they accept money orders if it doesn't already say that in the auction when you send a money order try to do it within hours because it can still take up to a week for it to get to the seller then it'll take another days before you get the item delivered if you are unable to do that send a courtesy email to the seller and let them know when you do plan on sending it so they don't get upset and file an unpaid item report on you after days so don't bid on something you need right away keep in mind that you don't have the buyer protection with money orders that you do with electronic transactions kind of a given but i still had to throw that in anyway because electronic transactions are much easier to trace i have almost a thousand positive feedback between being a buyer and seller and i can tell you that sellers have a harder time with honest buyers than the other way around i've never had a problem buying but boy can i tell you stuff about selling if you heed my advice above you'll do fine and you'll be glad to find another way to feed your hobbies good luck  Advance fee fraud Microeconomics Supply and demand PayPal Auction Electronic commerce Capitalism Bulk vending Contract Short selling Live 8 Phishing Mutual fund Surveillance Neopets Something Awful Arbitrage Theory of conduct Oil-for-Food Programme Illegal drug trade Futures contract Surplus value Plame affair The Apprentice 2 Mortgage Tax Real estate broker Inventory E-mail spam RuneScape cheats E-mail Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act MMORPG Wal-Mart Derivative (finance) Liberty Dollar Life insurance Warranty Economics Domain Name System Online auction business model Final Fantasy XI Amazon.com FairTax Hyperinflation Spam Prevention Early Warning System Social rule Price discrimination Option Advertising Usury Something Awful Forums Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Stock Mail fraud Best Buy United States Postal Service ITunes Music Store 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Enron Corporation Extreme Programming Spam (electronic) Call option Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Ra (board game) Dot-com Hard disk Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Day trading Commodity Labor theory of value ROM image Financial markets Insurance Gross domestic product On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Mergers and acquisitions Insider trading Nicomachean Ethics Stopping e-mail abuse Business-to-consumer electronic commerce Scientology beliefs and practices Privatization Network effect Credit card Conveyancing Publishing Copyright infringement of software Public domain MapleStory Sales Hire purchase

gardening business idea hi im trying to help out my father he has a gardening business he runs on his own he has about yrs of experience and is a hard worker he has a good reputation and clientel he is almost and well i dont want him to work to hard by himself anymore he makes good money but just want to take care of the family i would like some ideas for him to expand his business by internet or by word of mouth such as a gardening consulant or something just any ideas that i can make happen thru the internet so that he wont work to much but be able to make a living we are from la but maybe thinking of moving to las vegas i will be out of the military by the end of the year so whatever helps thanks maybe something online will be cool i want to focus on the internet helping out with the business thanks if you help him expand his business you should be there to help him run it talk to him about it first and if he's ok with it wait until you're out of the military to expand his business without helping him take on the extra work load would mean he'd have to work harder to stay afloat and that would be the opposite of what you want to do  Extreme Programming W.

i very hot business idea but dont know where to start and woder if there is some one that wants to join me i was at work at the casino and over heard to women talking the conversation they was talking about sparked a new idea in my mind i choose not to say it here due to the lack of no one has thought about it yet but its a good idea the problem is i dont know where to go with it the weird part about this idea and why i think it would be successful is because you have over a million people going to counselors to fix a problem some of those millions cant afford a counselor and their problem is not as big as it seems to be they just need someone to listen to them but this idea is different i cant explain it all but im wondering if there is a way i can get a online business set up and running with this idea and would anyone be interested in joining me with this idea i will explain the full details to anyone that is interested the cool part about it is that everyone goes through this and need a little helping hand which this idea would be a great service to them if its a web service let me know  Extreme Programming Avenue Q Social rule W.

programs over the years the box project has expanded to offer a wider range of programs to help empower self sufficiency providing assistance for the myriad problems our members face in a dignified and respectful way our recipients are screened and referred to us through various referral agencies in the rural areas that we serve to qualify they must live in a county designated as rural or agricultural by the usda and they must earn less than of the federal poverty guidelines matching programs family match this program creates a long term match between a sponsor and recipient the sponsors provide encouragement advice and boxes of needed supplies about once a month holiday match this program creates a short term match for just one winter holiday season sponsors or sponsor groups provide gifts food or supplies to make the holiday season extra special for a recipient family or a community center applications for the holiday match program are taken from september to october community center match this program creates a long term match between a sponsor or sponsor group and a community center in one of the rural areas that we serve education initiatives education is one of the core values of the box project we firmly believe that education is the key to increasing self sufficiency and breaking the cycle of poverty our steadfast commitment is to continue working to remove barriers to education wherever we can and make a significant effort to encourage and support education for our recipient families in the areas we serve educational fund our educational fund provides scholarships to help remove the barriers to acquiring higher education and vocational training to be eligible for these funds recipients and their sponsors must be members in good standing to determine eligibility for this fund email the box project office with both the sponsor and recipient name along with the details of your request we accept applications from our

contribution to the educational fund please indicate your request in the comments area of our online donation form back to school fund our back to school fund is for approved recipient families who have not yet been assigned a sponsor this fund provides for school supplies or uniforms to help ensure students can be ready and able to start school on the first day of classes we know that sometimes students have no way to get school clothes or supplies and that sometimes prevents them from starting school with their classmates to make a special contribution to the back to school fund please indicate your request in the comments area of our online donation form other programs emergency fund our emergency fund provides limited funding to recipient members for unexpected emergencies to be

helping one another to make a special contribution to the emergency fund please indicate your request in the comments area of our online donation form disaster response the box project is not positioned to be an emergency responder we are positioned to be there for the long term long after emergency responders have left and headlines have driven national interest in another direction your direct financial response to the box project when disasters strike our recipient areas will enhance our ability to respond to increased demand or special needs you may be able to help in these ways current recipient families already in our program that will have greater needs and require more resources existing sponsors will be called upon to help their recipient families find resources to meet their needs and help family and friends that may now be living with them they are going to need extra help from us even more families could be plunged into poverty the already struggling economy of the affected area will be further compromised and families that were self sufficient before the storm may need personalized short term help to regain that self sufficiency small local helping organizations that have always been there for local people will be strained to their limits they may not be the recipients of large government funding though they may make a significant difference in disasters they could use our help for the long term when a disaster occurs in one of the box project s areas of service please look for a direct link on this website telling you the ways we re helping and what we need from you visit our donation or what you can do pages for more information about these programs or for other ways you can join us in our quest to make a difference one family at a time

what do they check on a background check at a job they do a credit check too i said no for the box that said have you been convicted of a crime or have a pending felony but i had a minor in posession of alcohol when i was i'm now it was just a misdomeanor but i always thought that check box didn't apply to misdomeanors they made me sign an authorization to do a background check and i'm sure they'll see the mip will they care or do they only care about felonies in general and i don't have the greatest credit which is why i want a job to rebuild it and actually have money and i don't see why they need to look at my credit to determine whether i'm a worthy candidate in general do most companies judge by these things even if you have less than stellar credit and a small misdomeanor a credit check is usually done to see your habits they look at it as if you're habitually late paying bills are you going to be habitually late to work if you have a ton of debt are you likely to steal from the company the background check is to make sure you're not lying about not being a criminal or using a false identity to apply for the job as far as the misdemeanor if they question you about it you tell them honestly that you thought the question pertained only to felonies so you did answer it honestly  Plame affair Article One of the United States Constitution Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Credit card 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Prostitution Barbara Boxer Burglary Identity theft Socrates Internet fraud Bill Clinton Theory of conduct Karl Rove Government of Maryland Lie Jury trial Surveillance Detective Felony Arguments for and against drug prohibition United States Constitution Judicial functions of the House of Lords Evan Mecham Plame affair timeline Crime Kill Bill Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Civil rights Bruce Johnson Florida Central Voter File Parliament of the United Kingdom Murder U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Appeal Procrastination Ocean's Twelve Ronnie Earle Gun politics in the United States Court system of Canada Fred Phelps Notary public United States House of Representatives Scientology beliefs and practices Ethics Treason Hillary Rodham Clinton Ann Coulter Lewinsky scandal Babe Ruth Three strikes law Jury Probation officer 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Capital punishment E-mail spam Henry Lee Lucas Criminal justice system of Japan Credit score Merit Human rights in the United States Schabir Shaik Trial Contract Magistrate Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shoplifting Assault Jeff Gannon Public Eye Leo Frank Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Government of France History of the United States (1789-1849) Witness impeachment John Kerry Article Two of the United States Constitution National Kidney Foundation Singapore CPU cache Adoption Drug abuse Bill Maher Congress of the United States W.

how can i start my own buisness in photography im start learning now practice research and play with ideas when i was your age i wanted to start a business also at that time i never could have imagined that there was so much information out there so many things to learn build up your passion for what you want to do and be patient despite your limited opportunities now in the meantime while you're practicing and learning try to do small scale operations i've never done photography but depending on what you do i'm sure you can find something to offer the general idea is to consider what need someone else has and how you can apply your skills to help with that need considering you'll have no room for an advertising budget use word of mouth or flyers to advertise tell people what you're offering show them examples of what you have done the more you do the more you have to show and the more likely they'll see something they like don't be shy about it and don't be afraid to have people say they aren't interested you never know who might say they are consider making your own free website using simple templates and some creativity a lot of people will find it convenient to be able to see your photography portfolio online sorry i can't offer more specific ideas but i simply don't know enough about what you're doing good luck with your business  Theory of conduct Microeconomics Copyleft Advertising Milton H.

question about starting a business i'm about to start a business with someone who is from a foreign country he has connections with a company that wishes to expand to the u s he does not work for them but they are using him as a representative he is not a citizen or resident but he is legal for a short period of time is it legal to put him down as a shareholder well it's not my business but i tend to wonder why the company he works with is using him at all if he's not a citizen and they're using him as a representative it just sounds like some nigerian scammer hmm i'm not an attorney but i believe you can sell shares of a company to someone from another country that would give him voting rights and possibly responsibilities but i've learned the hard way do not give trust expect others to earn it i don't know the nature of your business or the company you wish to work with but i do know that it's hard to sue someone in another country so i would suggest you not give your 'partner' total control of anything without your oversight and certainly no control over the books or the ability to take out any sort of loan in the corporate name without your consent hope my little rant helped  Corporation Corporate governance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Stock Security (finance) Economy of Nigeria Advance fee fraud Divorce Microsoft Rupert Murdoch United Kingdom corporation tax SCO-Linux controversies Intellectual property Trademark Capitalism Trade union Government of India Act 1935 Privatization Democracy Classified information Law firm Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Mutual fund Monarchy in Canada Monetary policy Polyamory United States House of Representatives Lawyer Google Mikhail Khodorkovsky Board of directors Nike, Inc.

i wanna sell chinese product on line what should i do i wanna sell chinese product on line could anybody give some suggestion about the basic preparation i am not a business people just feel it interesting thanks my suggestion is to open a store on ebay the name alone brings the customers and the volume of traffic ensures hits the costs are up to you to a degree because you pay a percentage as opposed to a flat rate for sales and the system is user friendly the very smart people at ebay seem to be constantly making shopping on ebay easier all payments can be done electronically eliminating the wait for a snail mail payment i make payment as soon as i learn i've won a bid hope this helps  Network effect Internet fraud Amazon.com Electronic commerce Wal-Mart Management information system Live 8 Credit card Bulk vending Islamic banking Insurance London Congestion Charge Online shop Web traffic FairTax Spice Girls Copyleft Agricultural policy Advertising Publishing Auction Business-to-consumer electronic commerce Online marketing Neopets Commodore International Illegal drug trade CPU design Octopus card Gross domestic product Amway Retailer Apple II family EFTPOS Capitalism Toll road Whitney Houston E-mail spam Dot-com Gmail Economy of Russia Customer relationship management BAE Systems Skype American individualist anarchism Flat tax First-sale doctrine Ashton-Tate Digital rights management Video game publisher Business process reengineering Best Buy MAME MTR RFID Student loan Bond Capital accumulation Health insurance Unemployment Acorn Computers Mutual fund Jon Secada Taxation in the United States Price discrimination Online auction business model PayPal Call centre Electronic toll collection Fry's Electronics United States Postal Service Tax Sears Holdings Corporation Postage stamps and postal history of the United States Life insurance Microeconomics Monetary policy Open-source software Investment bank Apple Computer Video game crash of 1983 Public transport Mortgage Primerica Financial Services Day trading Economy of the United States United Kingdom corporation tax Argos (retailer) Contract bridge Vending machine Economy of India Smart card The Apprentice 2 Electronic money Costco Publicly funded medicine Western Union Anarchism and capitalism Hard disk Surplus value Bank

start my own hair salon i live in wichita ks and want to open a chic hair salon i have a great idea for it it would totally take off how do i go about opening a salon i don't have any money to start firstly if you have no direct experience in the hair salon business i'd advise that you work in one for the next six months or so doing everything from cutting hair to buying supplies and everything else possible so that you can get some of the experience you'll need to understand and run a hair salon profitably if this is your first business venture i would strongly recommend that you talk to a business counselor before you do anything especially spend money i'd call the local office of score go to http www score org and input your zip code to find the chapter nearest you the advice is free ask for someone who has a background in the services business and they'll try their best to match you with the right counselor the counselor at score will most likely advise you to write a business plan which is very good advice because it will force you to dig out all of the start up details and the costs of starting a hair salon and force you to also understand all of the aspects of this business including the customers you'll concentrate on your market and how you'll get them to find out and want to come to your fabulous hair salon the location of the salon is important but doesn't make it successful to prove that all you have to do is walk down a street in your town where there are several hair salons not far from each other and you'll find one or two that are empty while the others are very busy it has to do with ambiance and your reputation at the beginning and over time you also have to have the right registration from your state the right zoning the right city and county licenses and permits and you have to be skilled at negotiating with your landlord about who'll stand the cost of the build out or the changes to the premises to make it ready for your look and feel you also have to worry about the normal business planning and management issues related to starting up any business take a look and read some of the articles at http www ychange com small business consulting articles html especially the ones about a business plan and starting a business also try their blog and their bulletin board hope this helped  Economics Privatization Domain Name System United States Postal Service Cross site scripting Electronic commerce Extreme Programming OpenDocument Thomas Paine X Window System World Wide Web Mutual fund Information Technology Infrastructure Library Mozilla Firefox Karl Rove Strategic management Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Prostate cancer Salon.com Common Unix Printing System Microeconomics Breastfeeding ZIP Code Software patent debate Public domain Wal-Mart Melvin R.

a supply demand business that's most likely to be profitable i need an idea for a business that's based on buying and re selling like buying wholesale then selling it for profit or even a business where you invest in machines to provide most of the service like a coin laundry or tanning salon let's say you save around and you want to start a business so you can settle down and have more personal freedom or at least be able to work from home what type of business is usually profitable with the proper effort out into it of course something you can live comfortably off of and be able to move around more freely thanks whew you ask a simple question but the answer is very complicated if you want to work from home you would probably want to stay away from a business that would require you to carry inventory obviously your space is limited you may want to consider some type of financial service business like insurance or real estate if you have k to k to invest many insurance companies would love to talk to you in my opinion the advantage of insurance over real estate is that you get residual income with real estate you have to touch every dollar you make the biggest thing that surprises people about owning a business is the massive amount of work that needs to be done in the beginning to start things up i can step away from the business for a little while now but for the first years you are tied to it if you can hire someone that would help but remember that those people are counting on you for a paycheck any way you look at it starting a business is tough but rewarding  Insurance Life insurance Citigroup Bank Gross domestic product Microeconomics Warren Buffett Airline Business Keynesian economics Sears Holdings Corporation Labor theory of value Surplus value Real estate broker Deflation (economics) Monetary policy Tax Corporation Mortgage Wal-Mart Annuity Income trust Personal finance Joseph P.

how would i best explain the difference of retained profits and goodwill in the dissolving of a partnership much to my dismay my business partner and i no longer see eye to eye we started a small cleaning business about a year ago and now i would like to sell my share of the business to her for every job we got paid for we put away of total earnings into a savings account to help cover taxes in the future we have seen an accountant and are in agreement on the numbers however she does not seem to understand that half of the we put away would be my retained income and that the amount i am asking for the business are two seperate things she thinks that if she pays me my retained income that she has paid me for my share of the business and that we can dissolve the partnership but by doing this she is essentially just trying to give me my own money to pay for the business does anyone have any suggestions on how i can explain this to her in simple terms she says she in confused and doesn't undestand where i am coming from thanks for your help well first i am a cpa the structure of your partnership is what needs to be understood if you are an llp or llc then you received a k at the end of the year and that profit was taxable on your personal return even if you dissolve the partnership you will have the same type of income this year to date from your partnership if you don't have a formal llp or llc and are just working together as it sounds like you are then it's pretty simple first you should have been making estimated quarterly tax deposits which it sounds like you were not just putting it aside isn't correct so basically the money that you 'put aside' for taxes is a part of the business value and you should get your half of it and all assets of the business when you sale it to her the tax issue should be well documented you can email me if you need more informatin  United Kingdom corporation tax Limited liability company Corporation Gross domestic product Insurance Tax Income trust Warren Buffett Flat tax Life insurance FairTax Surplus value Microeconomics Mutual fund Capital accumulation Dividend Taxation in the United States Lloyd's of London Trust (Law) USA Bond Enron Corporation Income statement Law of value Progressive tax SCO-Linux controversies Leasing Finance Credit card Capitalism Bank Capital gains tax Personal finance Value added tax Monetary policy Labor theory of value Citigroup Mortgage Prices of production Microcredit Hedge fund Social Security debate (United States) Corporate finance Deflation (economics) Economic rent Tax avoidance/evasion Security (finance) Income Measures of national income and output Money Intellectual property Tax bracket PE ratio Inheritance tax Economics Economy of India Economy of Russia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bank fraud Double taxation Divorce Kyoto Protocol Law firm Asset Health insurance Timeline of the Enron scandal Internet fraud Airline Extreme Programming Unemployment benefit Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Productive and unproductive labour Ponzi scheme Principal-agent problem Plame affair Salary cap Theory of conduct Wal-Mart Tax haven Accounting methods Poker jargon Bretton Woods system Inflation Trademark Cost of capital Compensation of employees Contract Interest Derivative (finance) Tax protester Health savings account

why is everyone going to china for parts etc i have a small business in chgo area we will have to close soon due to our clients going to china for parts that cost less has anyone been concerned about this delimma recent stories reflect badly on china lead in paint for kid's toys recall of food etc why can't americans buy american so what if it costs a little more parts made in america by american citizens keep the jobs here i'm so angry about this i could bust than there's walmart what of their products are made in china wake up america well first of all not everything in china is bad china is a quickly devoloping country and is encountering growing pains however american business operates on the principle that cheaper is better that is primarily because americans are greedy and want to make more money china doesnt allow the same type of labor unions our country does and the cost of living is much lower in china therefore they pay there employees less most of which may not be as skilled as employees in america are expected to be that is why the big three american automakers are suffering so badly for years they outsourced parts from mexico and canada why because they could produce parts cheaper because they dont have labor unions usually people in a union are paid more as they are seen as highly skilled laborers however in mexico the cost of living is much lower than here stateside so they simply pay there employees less thereby reducing the cost of manufacturing a product so that they can sell it for cheaper that is part of the reason that the big three are having such a hard time that fact itself is giving people the wrong idea why buy american if its made in canada well if americans werent so money hungry and expected full benefits from their parent company they wouldnt need to outsource paying a union to produce an individual part can cost gm three or four times what it would cost to have it made in mexico and if they depended on unions to produce every part the ford focus would cost three times what it does now that doesnt make you very competitive on top of that gm is still paying for full medical benefits for employees that are retired most of those have their spouses insured and it is costing gm millions if not billions of dollars so they need a way to save money even if you arent in a union usually skilled laborers are paid more in the u s because we simply cant afford not to get paid at a given rate i am sorry that you are losing your job because somewhere there is a guy in a plush office who will make a ton of money because he is outsourcing a product from china and i do agree that is wrong but then so is most of america these days and if the car example isnt good for your situation i just know its based on the same principle it all comes down to saving a couple of bucks if some of these companies actually thought about their employees i would respect them more but on the same token their own employees can run a company into the ground especially if they are in a union by not being cooperative when it comes to cutting cost  Outsourcing Wal-Mart Unemployment Offshoring Insurance Free trade Tariff Capitalism Microeconomics Labour economics Social Security (United States) Health insurance Life insurance Economy of the United States Sweatshop Delta Air Lines Capital accumulation Canadian and American health care systems compared Canadian and American economies compared Citigroup Keynesian economics Airline Kyoto Protocol Illegal drug trade 401(k) Privatization American individualist anarchism Minimum wage Economy of Russia Supply and demand Law of value Bulk vending Trade union Economic inequality Flat tax Intellectual property Social Security debate (United States) Monetary policy Unemployment benefit Education in the People's Republic of China Publicly funded medicine Tax Economics Freeters Cooperative Annuity Hyperinflation Taxation in the United States FairTax Famine Surplus value Great Depression Bretton Woods system Primerica Financial Services Filling station Divorce Marshall Plan Economy of India United States Postal Service Sport utility vehicle Anarchism and capitalism Arbitrage Natural monopoly Pharmaceutical company Conscription Economy of Africa Poker jargon Biodiesel Labor theory of value Blackjack Affirmative action Economy of Norway Economy of Belgium Say's law Food and Drug Administration Mortgage Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 MMORPG Reaganomics Health care in the United States Externality Canadian dollar Gross domestic product Trade United States dollar Protectionism Tort reform Economy of Macau Unemployment types

can i deduct paving of driveway necessary for home business i just had my driveway paved which was necessary for business deliveries trucks to my home the office portion is the barn situated beyond the house can i expense the whole thing because of this if so should i classify this as payment to a subcontractor thanks it depends on what your business is and and if it is used strictly by the business traffic or if it also accesses your private residence you may be able to take a portion of the cost and apply it as a business expense it would go under building improvements or transportation costs if you produce a product delivery costs should be adjusted to include a portion of it because the driveway is required to receive goods and is considered a variable cost you need to consult your tax dept regarding the amount allowable as a business expense if the property is owned by the business and you live on it you can consider the house part of the business and of the costs can be applied but if you just have a section of it used for the business say of the property space is for your business then probably only of the driveway costs can be used as a business expense  Gross domestic product Insurance Taxation in the United States Microeconomics United States Postal Service Tax FairTax Sport utility vehicle Social Security (United States) Publicly funded medicine Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Life insurance Mortgage 401(k) Public transport United Kingdom corporation tax Wal-Mart Student loan Road transport Flat tax Easement Public good Hybrid vehicle Supply and demand Leasing Economy of India Food Stamp Program American individualist anarchism Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Big Dig Property (ownership right) Credit card Capitalism Property tax CPU cache Surplus value Compiler optimization Economy of the United States Street Intellectual property McMansion Biodiesel Toll road Capital accumulation Highway London Congestion Charge National Weather Service Enterprise resource planning Income statement Production theory basics Welding Freeway Productive and unproductive labour Wood Tax deduction Passenger car Affton, Missouri Urban sprawl Capital gains tax Airport Economics Zoning Free trade Hiawatha Line Arlington County, Virginia Personal finance Wayne Corporation Faux frais of production Transport in Sudan Inventory Transformer General Dynamics F-111 General aviation Inflation Unemployment Operating surplus Transportation of Los Angeles Sewage treatment Small business Child support Energy development Keynesian economics Just In Time Mail Space Shuttle program Asset Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Autonomous building Cost Income trust Progressive tax Information Services Procurement Library Divorce Light rail Alcohol fuel E85

how to attract customers to my meat counter i work in a tesco store part time but i'm considering a team leader role in this store i have to start on the counters as i currently work on the meat counter my main problem is attracting the customers to the counter first problem the price of the meat as far as i'm concerned is too expensive and tesco won't budge on the price second problem recent programme regarding the counters at tesco and sainsbury's haven't helped i'm currently trying different lines for the counter and always make sure the counter looks fully stocked and fresh other than putting a gun to peoples heads i just have no ideas it feels like flogging a dead horse if anyone has some genuine ideas please put them forward i've already asked the customers yes i know lower the price but as i said tesco won't budge at a meat counter i would like to see recipes and tips on grilling first of all even though the prices are rather high do they have a good quality of meat also put together packages a lot of small butcher shop owners put together like weekly packages and sell it at a package price that is a bit cheaper than buying all the same items individually then moms and housewives can pick out the whole week of meat get a package price and people are pretty happy with that make premade meat loafs and pre marinaded stuff all they have to do is take it out and prepare it without doing all that work if a housewife or a working mom can save some time and money that s great plus you may be giving them to off in giving them a package price but if they like the idea you will make up the sales in volume give them a deal that saves them a little money and makes their lives a little easier  Wal-Mart J Sainsbury Meat Loaf Tesco Ireland Argos (retailer) My Little Pony Hamburger Microeconomics Plastic Supermarket Best Buy Internet fraud The Apprentice 2 Ramen Loyalty program Supply and demand Mutual fund Illegal drug trade Extreme Programming Bulk vending Aldi Tofu Costco Electronic commerce CPU design Morrisons Supply-side economics Hydrogen economy Filling station Barbecue Theory of conduct No frills MRE Arbitrage United Kingdom corporation tax Cuisine of Denmark Airsoft AMD Common Agricultural Policy Investment bank Social Security debate (United States) RFID Short selling Boots Group Economics Small business Commodore 64 Central processing unit Star Trek Customizable Card Game Health insurance Sears Holdings Corporation Inventory Capital accumulation Bread Inflation Jim Steinman CPU cache Wind turbine ITunes Music Store Atkins Nutritional Approach $ale of the Century W H Smith Gold as an investment Fry's Electronics Mergers and acquisitions Dairy Capitalism RuneScape economy Free trade Los Angeles Clippers Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Food Outsourcing ASDA Cable television Asian financial crisis MMORPG Public good Electronic Arts Freeters EastEnders Economy of Russia Current teachings of Prem Rawat Auction Cyprus dispute History of the United States (1918-1945) American Broadcasting Company Technical analysis Audi

work permit where can i obtain a work permit i am and am looking to obtain one oh and maybe some possible jobs here's a short list of jobs which you can create to generate income learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties birthday celebrations etc seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples a starter calligraphy kit usually runs around and anyone can easily pick up this skill the going rate is usually per hand addressed item become a poser who assists wedding photographers in setting and arranging various individuals in group and single photographic positions posers carry around a sketch book of various sitting and standing poses which consists of onion skin overlays of various wedding pictures bound in albums again contact local wedding photographers and wedding planners accordingly the hourly pay is around per hour and you are often invited to attend all dining activities seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting weed removal plant tree trimming light brush clearance you will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools again do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved a door to door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between to per hour offer policing removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process again a door to door solicitation of neighbors is in order you can charge between to per hour acquire a set of window cleaning tools a bucket liquid window cleaner sponge squeegee handle with an extension and a small step ladder and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services however be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story charge per window panel become a proxy stand in for neighbors to allow delivery of goods and packages to your home apartment acquire the authority to sign any receipt of incoming packages as an accepting neighbor charge per each package handled by you consider becoming a restaurant cafe customer liaison by using your cell phone at restaurants cafes to coordinate with the hostess to keep track of waiting customers whenever there's a very long period of time to activate a waiting list you want to offer the restaurant your services so that customers do not have to stand around for any lengthy period of time and when their name assigned number comes up you can call the upcoming customer's cell phone to tell them that they can return to the restaurant and be served the call back fee is usually around cents on a per head basis for example a couple would be charged while children under would not be charged placement of a plaque which outlines your fee schedule near the hostess station is sufficient to garner attention of prospective customers who will value your services since they can do other activities outside of the restaurant often beyond the range of any inhouse paging system you realize that everyone has a cellphone and why not take advantage of the connectivity to make the diner's experience worthwhile the restaurant will also appreciate the added service you are providing as a customer liaison why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing convalescent assisted living care centers and hospitals it involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves the starting rate is per hour the only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding a posting of your services by a business card or flyer on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers the paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time good luck  Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act United States Postal Service Spam (electronic) Japanese tea ceremony Windows XP E-mail spam Voice over IP Expert system

what is the best way to bargain for a better salary after you have initially blown it i was following up on some resumes and got the regional manager of an applebee's on the phone immediately a phone interview ensued for which i did pretty well until he asked me my salary requirements i blurted out feeling so mad that i had not researched before calling he said that the least he pays his managers is we have scheduled an in person interview and i wondered if offered the job future negotions are out of the question two things come to mind i have years management experience at a bakery and years as a server in restaurants also my degree was in psychology which is of lowrelevance but still applicable i entered in my experience at salary com and found the median for someone like me is around range within first standard deviation k k does this sound right for an applebee's manager if offered the job should i try to renegotiate if so what would be the most convincing way thank you when you're negotiating salary the important thing to ask is what is the salary range of this position in other words no matter what the job where is the start point mid point and end point for the salary paid for that job you know the start point is apparently k so now you need to know the other data points to determine if the offer they give you is fair based on your experience the point of knowing is to place yourself between start and mid point so that you are positioned well for growth and salary increases if you are successful unless you have oodles of experience going above mid point can be risky as it can both heighten expectation and limit growth best of luck  Economic inequality Milton H.

if you sell something on ebay and the buyer will not speak to you after they win your auction they will not pay you do you think if you went through all of the proper channels that you would give the non communicating non paying buyer negative feedback i would think that if you left them negative feedback even if they deserved it they they would leave you negative feedback and if you had positive how would that make you feel i have and would like to keep it that way but out of respect for other vendors who might trust the non paying buyer i had to go through proper channels first and then i felt it only right to file a negative feedback so that people would know how this person conducts business i had two non payers in one week and i gave them the days to pay like i said in my auction emailed them and said they have whole days to pay or atleast contact me to let me know how they plan to pay or when when i had no contact after that nd day i filed an unpaid item dispute against them in order to get your refund on listing the item you have to wait i believe it's days after that you can close the dispute and in the comment part i put no contact and no payment then i go to leave them negative and be specific gave x amount of days and no payment or contacting happened and so forth that way if they do leave you negative then people can see why and then see your side of the story and then it makes sense when i do shop for things and they have negative i always check out both sides of the story and you can tell when someone is being honest about their negative or not back on the story the that i did the unpaid item dispute when i went to leave them negatives they had too many strikes or whatever and i ended up making them unregistered ebay members so that saved me a negative but usually if they don't pay or contact you and you leave a negative bout half the time they won't even respond back to their feedback good luck hun  Internet fraud Auction Taxation in the United States PayPal Advance fee fraud Neopets Negative feedback Live 8 Something Awful Plame affair Electronic commerce Reputation management Social rule Progressive tax Amazon.com Electrophysiology Transactional analysis Mortgage Theory of conduct Real estate broker Poker jargon Online auction business model Estoppel Customer relationship management Wal-Mart Islamic banking Tax Microeconomics Adoption Operational amplifier Extreme Programming Price discrimination Commodity markets Bond Web traffic The Apprentice 2 Advertising Online marketing Something Awful Forums Gmail Surveillance Bulk vending Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Phishing Security (finance) Happiness Feedback Credit card Oil-for-Food Programme Contract United States Postal Service Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act FairTax Child support Copyleft Octopus card ITV ROM image SCO-Linux controversies Electronic amplifier Surplus value Warranty Ra (board game) MapleStory Mouse (computing) B__rgerliches Gesetzbuch Deflation (economics) Logo programming language Transistor Appeal Short selling West Indian cricket team Coercion E-mail Chess strategy and tactics Jizya Health insurance Publicly funded medicine Getting Things Done Mutual fund Sit-up Ltd Otakon Brit Hume Chess terminology Trademark Option Vending machine Measures of national income and output Annuity 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Ocean's Twelve United Kingdom corporation tax The Amazing Race Topps Abramoff-Reed Indian Gambling Scandal Nine Inch Nails Arbitrage

vote should i return the deposit i have a entertainment booking business i have recently began requiring that customers pay a deposit because business is really growing and we are losing too much money on clients who cancel at the last minute keeping us from scheduling someone else the other issue is that the entertainer gets over to the neighborhood and then gets lost and when he she tries to call the host hostess they don't answer the phone to give directions and thus the entertainer gives up just as a survey how many of you think its justified to require a deposit and for me to keep the deposit if the client backs out at the last minute keeping in mind if its a legitimate emergency i can credit the deposit for a future re scheduled party this one is the tricky one what about if we should keep the deposit if we drive all the way to the clients area get lost and the host hostess won't answer the telephone to help us find the place and we lose the booking your opinion please thanks if the client cancels at the last minute you may and should keep the deposit since it prevented you from booking other work in the interim however the responsibility to find the client's premises falls upon your business it's not the client's fault that you can't find them and they're not responsible to answer the phone to give you directions either you and your workers need to develop a system with maps so that you know where you're going and so that you show up on time  Insurance Domain Name System Credit card Call centre Telephone booth Corporate governance Voice over IP Customer relationship management Whois Family Feud Surveillance Skype Internet fraud Phreaking Telephone numbering plan The Amazing Race North American Numbering Plan Bank Password Opinion poll Microsoft Security (finance) Outsourcing Wal-Mart Prostitution Data retention Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

has anyone bought herbalife only for the business opportunity and given up because they got no result perhaps when you go into a business as a business person you have to wonder why something is not for everyone whether respect is based on opinion experience or reputation with more and more businesses using direct marketing to move what they sell you have to ask for those that tried and failed was it because they were bringing the need for greed to the market place or was it personally an experience where a husband wife team failed because one was full on the other not does an equilibrium of balance better describe your own partnerships in life or is it a deeper picture where you as a family create team effort and giving up cigarettes alcohol being healthier and having fun was too much trouble finally if you never tried herbalife saw some amazing summer results here in australia a first ever podium finish for mens beach volleyball and you are full on for physical fitness i am fully trained in sports nutrition and weight loss as well as the biz op too i haven't researched that company but however if you just bought in for the business side i think that was a bad mistake do they have a proven product and do you personally use the product  Herbalife Atkins Nutritional Approach Volleyball Ultimate (sport) Economics Microeconomics Mergers and acquisitions Tax Enron Corporation Yelena Davydova Sega BMW 2005 United States Grand Prix Food and Drug Administration Supply and demand Sinclair Research Ltd Norway national football team History of Formula One Citigroup Electronic commerce Mazda RX-7 Alex Ferguson Brazil at the 2004 Summer Olympics 24 Hours of Le Mans Audi Heinkel He 100 English cricket team Strategic planning The Ashes Marketing Tobacco advertising Cigarette Jacques Villeneuve Infantilism Airline Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Weight training Sears Holdings Corporation 1896 Summer Olympics Rational Unified Process BAE Systems Divorce Renault WilliamsF1 Charles Goodyear Marketing research Ken Keyes, Jr. Nutrition Wal-Mart Prices of production Theory of conduct Rupert Murdoch Corporation Amway Kimi R__ikk__nen Jordan Grand Prix Milk Human height Primerica Financial Services Deflation (economics) Warren Buffett Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Wayne Corporation Stroke Capital accumulation Ayrton Senna I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue CBS Management Technical analysis Business Marvel Comics Heinkel He 112 Panavision Glossary of partner dance terms Low-carbohydrate diet Tai Chi Chuan Extreme Programming Dublin City University Cyrus S.

how do pampered chef consultants earn trips i'm considering joining the pampered chef forces and i'm just wondering how exactly you earn free trips i would love to go to some of the places that people earn trips to and i'm just wondering how that works their incentive program is broken down into points you get one point for every dollar of product you sell when you start up and do your first shows they give you points for becoming an active consultant when you recruit others and they do their first shows you recieve another points for them becoming active consultants when you promote to another level you earn points or if a consultant you recruited promotes you also earn points they have different levels of incentives at each level you can choose to go on the trip or take a gift certificate for if you for some reason can't go on the trip or you don't want to i started working as a consultant at the end of one year and i didn't know how the points really worked i figured to qualify you had to sell all the time so i never even gave it a second thought half way through my second year i realized i had already acheived the first level and was well on my way to earning the second the second level was a trip to san francisco we had just been to san fransisco that year so i opted for the gift certificate it was and i went to best buy and bought the best sony digital video camera available i would never have spent that much money on a video camera but it was my reward and i wanted something amazing to keep up with my small children i am so grateful for the pampered chef for giving me that option this year if you earn the second level they will send you on a carribean cruise for days i will easily earn the third level which is a trip for all expenses paid to london for days and nights or you could choose to go to washington d c on a trip for if you earn the th level you earn an extra day and an extra night it isn't difficult to earn the trips it just comes down to running a consistant business and keeping track of where you are and what you want to achieve let me know if you have any questions  Wheel of Fortune Neopets The Apprentice 2 Microeconomics Amway Grand Theft Auto (game) Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Animal Crossing Labour economics San Francisco 49ers Emotions (album) Capitalism The Amazing Race $ale of the Century Digital photography Mutual fund Poker jargon Insurance Education in the People's Republic of China The Ashlee Simpson Show Unemployment benefit Berkshire Hathaway ITunes Music Store Wal-Mart Taxation in the United States Torquay United F.C.

considering selling mark avon i am i am looking for a good job to make a little extra money i love the idea of working at home and i love makeup so this seems like my ideal job but i have a few questions and i can't seem to find the answers on their website so if there are any reps i would greatly appreciate your help ok so there is a start up fee what do you get because that is one weeks allowance lol and do i have to buy products in advance and hope they sell and if they don't do i lose money or do i order them as i need them also i have lots of friends in different states i would love to sell to but i saw something about having to deliver the orders is it not a possibility to mail them or have them mailed and one last thing can i sell on ebay or on a website thanks in advance for any help thank you but i don't think that arbonne is for me fist of all it is waaay to overpriced for me to believe i can sell it to my teenage friends lol and as i stated i am only so i don't exactly have a resume to send in so i think i'll stick with considering mark but thanks again well i use to sell avon for about months they give you a few brochures to start you out with samples and usually a little gift i am and thought avon would be a good thing for me but it got too overwhelming if you plan on only selling part time then you have to keep in mind that you pay for your brochures usually samples and that is per campaign weeks long now im not too familiar with mark but i am assuming it is pretty much the same thing i would try it out and take advantage of the breaks they give you during your first couple of campaigns if you dont like it you can quit and you can mail the products to your friends the only problem is pigger items can add up i sell on ebay and you are not sappose to sell on ebay i never bought products that i did not know i was going to sell so you dont get stuck with a bunch of stuff another thing about ebay is that you will ne lucky if you make half of what you would get from selling to people around you mark is more expensive so it may be a little harder to sell but if you sell to people in your age group and know a lot of people i think it will work out for you good luck hopefully everything works out for you arbonne is soooo expensive and for older people their products are like on average vs with avon you will get stuck in a bad situation of u go through arbonne plus idk if u can be and work through their business since you cant sell on ebay restrictions and you can get in trouble advertise on myspace personal web site facebook make business cards if your bday is not that much further i would suggest waiting and selling with avon directly hopefully i helped you out  Internet fraud Social rule Advance fee fraud Bulk vending Neopets Wal-Mart Theory of conduct Poker jargon Unemployment Electronic commerce EastEnders Nine Inch Nails The Apprentice 2 Extreme Programming Amazon.com RuneScape quests Jennifer Lopez Dot-com 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Amazing Race Microeconomics Quarashi Network effect Avenue Q Facebook (website) Mutual fund RuneScape cheats Time Out of Mind Mail fraud Web traffic Surveillance Spice Girls April Fool's Day FairTax Pitaten Shen Gong Wu EverQuest Make money fast Craps Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Blonde on Blonde Advertising Best Buy Meat Loaf The nature of God in Western theology Little Britain MoveOn Married... with Children Cruising (maritime) Animal Crossing Final Fantasy XI Star Trek Customizable Card Game Externality Carl Barks MapleStory Apple Macintosh GED Gross domestic product Scientology beliefs and practices Sampling (music) Value added tax Arianne United States Postal Service Betting (poker) Socrates Ty Cobb $ale of the Century IBM PC compatible RuneScape economy Theodore Kaczynski Pretty Good Privacy New Coke NeXT Great Teacher Onizuka Illegal drug trade Leeds United F.C.

how can i get my business to grow i sell avon i have been selling avon for years it isnt going well im not sure if i should let go of it or put more into it i hand out books around my area i hand out to my customers i created a myspace page i have friends on my page but no orders how can i get online and sell this stuff anyone know about marketing and such for this type of business i even posted on craigslist i just found a new site i posted on gohuman i created all these pages and they took time and alot of work and i got nothing can someone help me i am constanly looking online of how i can do better with this i am really looking for customers to order online but ether way would be great help see my page www myspace com avon i did mary kay for several years and have several friends doing similar home based sales there are a couple of things that pop out when it comes to getting customers the net is a great way for people to find you and contact you for some home based sales though it isn't always the best way to accumulate sales most of the companies like avon will see online to anyone wihout needing to use a rep as a way into the system so what you may want to do is start a rewards program for your customers you can make up small cards on your home printer and for each purchase of so many dollars they get a stamp after making a certain number of stamps they can either get a small product for free or a discount on the next purchase keep track of all this for tax reasons if they order online they get one extra stamp each time this will provide incentive for using your website also if avon's company site does allow customers to attribute the sale to specific reps be sure all you customers have the needed id or information include it on the back of your books mary kay reps are expected to be appropriately dressed and made up for any situation where they could encounter a new customer basically any time we left the house in was ingrained that we always carry cards catalogs or the latest sale flyers and some small sample my group leader told us to leave cards and give them out to everyone waitresses the girl at the pharmacy the woman we spoke to inline at the grocery store if anyone commented on our makeup scent or skin we would mention the product we used and offer a sample it seems a bit pushy but let me tell you it worked i got more orders that way especially for things like lotions and hair care products find your niche a lot of the most successful reps work with certain groups at first if you're a stay at home mom who knows other stay at home mom's do a spa day using any of the appropriate products be sure to have a disply set up of any products good for kids such as sun tan lotion bug repellant child friendly shampoos if you work in an office pass out brochures and include a note on the desk freshen up pack deoderant face powder hand lotion etc work out what would best suit your workplace design the set and price it i had a very unusual niche drag queens i lived in an area with a large gay community and these guys loved having someone come to them and teach them about skin care and makeup i made a killing every time they ordered the point is use the contacts you have to build up the group you can really market yourself to that will lead into an ever wider circle of orders spouse shopping services are really helpful many spouses want to get thier sweeties some of your products but have no idea what their wives may order or how to get it around every female oriented holiday send letters out to the spouses reminding them that you would be more than happy to help them put together fabulous gift baskets now to do this you really need to keep track of what your regular customers order but it can be worth it the big trick is exsposure hang catalogs on every house on your street and another two streets in your neighborhood switch streets every so often but always put a catalog on the door of anyone who even contacted you a sign on your front yard if allowed by your hoa and one of those lovely magnet signs for your care are inexspensive ways to let folks know you're out there if you have kids in school see if you can come up with a fundraiser to do with them set up display tables and bring along any items youhave stocked for immediate sale to any holiday bazaars church sales or local fleamarkets the more you do to get known the more people you will reach good luck ps one other thing you may want to consider moving your page to a place like yahoo or even purchasing a site of your own someplace it is not exspensive the problem with myspace is twofold one you have to register to access the pages which many customers simply won't want to do and the other is the reputation of the site my bet is you are putting off a fair number of people because of it  Sears Holdings Corporation Electronic commerce Wal-Mart Tesco Poker jargon Loyalty program FairTax Best Buy United States

tips on running a coffee shop ok so i want to run a coffee shop in san francisco when i'm older a place where people can go to hang out or to do some work on their computers and to read i'm going to make muffins provide coffee and other things that a normal coffee shop has i'm going to open it at around am im going to have a section for people to be able to use their computers a section where they can read and a place to eat and hang out any tips at all for helping me make this business successful and to make my coffee shop popular thanks okay you'll need to have two 'levels' one for computer users one for readers and there will always be some who just want 'coffee and a bite' who will 'sit wherever they want ' while you say you will 'make' the muffins that is not a good idea for one thing you'll want a 'good variety' of 'ediibles' not just muffins and can 'contract' those for less than the cost for you to 'bake them in house' you'd need a full 'commercial bakery' behind the shop which will triple the 'cost' of the 'coffee shop ' next are you going to have just coffee bad idea you'll want to serve a 'variety of drinks' drip coffee espresso latte iced and hot tea herb tea and even some milk and some good sodas for edibles you should have things like muffins scones croissants and english muffins plus some 'sandwiches' and possibly some salads and always have at least one 'soup' for lunch i've lived in sf and you will 'need soup' year 'round which you should 'change daily' or you could do up to three different soups and 'keep' one for every day a basic 'vegetable soup' and change the other two always have 'clam chowder' available on fridays next you'll need to think of 'seating' and 'flow' also things like 'bussing' cleaning the tables after customers leave and keeping the whole 'shop' clean and the 'seating' and 'plugs' for people who don't want to use a 'battery' up on their computer will you have any computers that people can 'rent' or use for free what will you put as 'software' on those and where will you put them and how will people 'pay' to use them how many seats think in terms of 'tops' restaurants use the term how many 'two tops ' how many 'four tops ' and how many 'long tables' where either 'singles' can sit or a large group could sit what about 'books ' would you want to 'sell new books' you could open 'right next door' to an independant bookstore and just 'cut a door through' that works well in the city i now live in or just let people 'donate' the books they don't want and others 'take them away ' you'll need to 'keep records' and have a 'real plan' or you could end up with far too many books or far too few books then there's the biggest thing you'll need to know before you ever open your doors customer flow how you will 'advertise' and what the ads say will do a lot to 'determine' the type of 'customer' you get also your 'location' will influence that too you can't open a place for 'homeless' to gather in a high end shop andy more than you can expect to get 'high end customers' in a shop next door to a 'homeless hotel ' also in sf you have one other 'thing' to think about the 'sexuality' of the customers you want do you want 'no gays' or 'all gays' or 'a combination fo straights and gays' or no straights all straights or a combination of what about 'security' what will you do if a homeless person comes in and falls asleep at a table with or without buying a cup of coffee will you want 'cops as customers' to be your security or will you want to hire a 'clerk' who can become a 'bouncer' as needed you have a 'lovely idea' and i am not trying to get you to decide to 'quit' but you must think everything through for now since you are 'still in school' try to take as many 'business courses' as you can including one in 'business planning' because the first thing you'll need is a 'good business plan' to know 'what you know what you need to learn and what to 'delegate' to others ' i wish you already had a 'name and address' of your 'future coffee shop' because my husband and i will visit san francisco in the future and i would love to walk in and 'introduce myself' and congratulate you on 'a job well done ' i know you'll do it because you are 'already there' in your head all you need is a 'little help' to get you there in reality  Cha chaan teng Coffee Cuisine of Denmark

business copywrite name vs state registered name hello we bought into a franchise and recently encountered a situation where the franchise name is the same as a locally owned small business the locally owned business sent us out a letter stating we are using their name and demanded we stop using their name immediately because the name has been registered with the state since however the franchise we own has the name copy written since our question is which owner's name has the true dominance over the other franchise or local the franchise trademarked name would take a step above the local on this basis the copywrite name was registered in and the local was never registared through federal trademark venues the fall back to this is if the trademark registration has lasped copywrite name logo's brands and so on have to be registered every years but there is a follow up of current usage between years and of every term i hope this helps  Trademark Vehicle registration plate ITV Brand Intellectual property Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Fair use Logo US and Canadian license plates Public domain United States trademark law Elections in the United Kingdom Advertising Franchising Copyright Genericized trademark SCO-Linux controversies Copywriter Oakland Athletics American Broadcasting Company ITV1 Unreformed House of Commons Legal research Geographical indication Apple Computer German car number plates Copy protection Sears Holdings Corporation New York Giants Electronic Arts Corporation Patent attorney BMW United States Football League Oakland Raiders Viacom Electoral systems of the Australian states and territories Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Topps Los Angeles Clippers Elections in the United States Copyright Term Extension Act Xerox Automatic teller machine United States Patent and Trademark Office Bass (beer) Granada Television Nintendo Television in the United States Wayne Corporation St. Louis Rams Cleveland Browns .biz Tesco CTV television network Springfield Falcons Security (finance) Cable television Citigroup Vancouver Canucks Formula One Burger King Bayer HMV Jacksonville Jaguars Gun politics in the United States Wells Fargo Champ Car Grampian Television United States copyright law Sprint Nextel Corporation SCO v.

i want to own a franchise then my own business what should i major in years old here sophmore my major is business management a community college currently have a gpa so i planned to transfer to a year college rutgers currently i plan to own a franchise in my early 's i then possibly want to open my own business after i get my feet wet with franchising or more franchises my goal this is the problem i am not very good at math i am only in college to have something to fall back on i know you do not need a degree to be a business man i already invest of a million dollars in stocks mutual funds etc etc from an accident early on in life i am extremely confused on what to do at this point in my life i orginally wanted to graduate with an associates and get into business but now im starting to believe i need a year just incase what do you think i should major in if you were in my situation i really want to do business however i really am terrible in math and i am afraid to do bad or fail what would u major in also growing up all my friends fathers were very successful business men i've always had the mentality that college is not necessary for what i want to achieve in life because i have money on the side invested please be realistic here and realize that i am not the most school oriented student here and infact i dislike school a lot however i know i need something to fall back on please answer this question from a realistic stand point and not you can do it if you put your mind to it thank you all this is my advise transfer to a four year live on campus and while you pursue whatever major interests you have fun and screw every cute girl you can it is college it is preparation for real life and basically all college teaches you is how to make critical informed decisions based on self based research while requiring and developing the ability to perform your work through self motivation and that is really it besides to open a franchise all you really need is money in the bank and a desire to dedicate yourself to the success of your business most franchised business' won't even talk to you without you having or more in assets but they don't care if you never even finished high school just that you are finacially ready to invest in their company honestly it is less expensive to start your own business rather than a franchise a franchise will require you to pay a franchise fee the start up costs and most require residual royalties over the life of your business as well although a franchise is less risk due mainly to brand recognition it is much more work and much more expensive also you have to do things as the franchise says not what you want anyway go to college for the experience and to gain important knowledge not so you have something to fall back on construction jobs are for that live it up and enjoy life while you are allowed to just set your goals one at a time and pursue thier accomplishment and then it is on to the next goal that is how you will suceed that is what you ought to do you need an mba to do anything in the big business world anyhow so just keep that in mind and know that owning a small business is not easy  Mutual fund Graduate school Theory of conduct Education in the People's Republic of China Microcredit Capital accumulation Insurance Deflation (economics) Warren Buffett Citigroup Grade (education) W.

which job is better ups or telemarketing job for college student i work for ups but offered a call center job i don't know which one is best they pay the same offer good hours but call center has weekends with out optional meaning i must work weekends for a year i don't know i'm a student and need some spending money but i'm a lazy person and its hot as heck this summer can someone tell me what its like to work in call center enviroment too thanks i am a loader and the call center is not telemarketing it is phone interviews for customer satisfaction s it depends on the type of callcenter if you're talking telemarketing you'll be calling people and trying to sell them something and your pay will likely be mostly comission based if you sell more product then you get more money the stress is probably much higher that being said you'll likely be in a nice air conditioned room so it's comforatble in the summer if it's telemarketing for the alumni association you'll be making calls to graduates of the college asking for donations reading from a script that they give you i hope that helps since it's not a sales telemarketing job and it pays the same as ups and it's indoors air conditioned and you claim to be lazy the question seems to be should you switch from a labor job that gives you your weekends to a desk job the eats up your weekends personally i think i'd rather have my weekends given that choice but if the heat work is too much for you go for the call center job you can always talk up the call center job in a resume highlighting your excellent communication skills good luck  Telemarketing Call centre Singlish The Apprentice 2 Social rule Graduate school Air traffic controller Ocean's Twelve Predictive dialer Direct marketing Education in the United States Internet fraud Wal-Mart Customer relationship management Unemployment United Parcel Service Contract Microeconomics Education in the People's Republic of China Animal Crossing JR Digs Economic inequality Sales College admissions Academia Hollywood Squares Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

becoming a makeup artist how can you become a makeup atrist and work your way up to get a makeup salon one day hwo much would that cost to open your own salon how long will it take to become the makeup artist and open a salon what do i do to work my way up to that heighth of becoming a true makeup artist thanks u s department of labor bureau of labor statistics occupational outlook handbook http www bls gov oco ocos htm all states require barbers cosmetologists and most other personal appearance workers with the exception of shampooers to be licensed however qualifications for a license vary by state generally a person must have graduated from a state licensed barber or cosmetology school and be at least years old a few states require applicants to pass a physical examination some states require graduation from high school while others require as little as an eighth grade education in a few states the completion of an apprenticeship can substitute for graduation from a school but very few barbers or cosmetologists learn their skills in this way applicants for a license usually are required to pass a written test and demonstrate an ability to perform basic barbering or cosmetology services public and private vocational schools offer daytime or evening classes in barbering and cosmetology full time programs in barbering and cosmetology usually last to months but training for manicurists and pedicurists skin care specialists and electrologists requires significantly less time an apprenticeship program can last from to years shampooers generally do not need formal training or a license formal training programs include classroom study demonstrations and practical work students study the basic services cutting and styling hair chemically treating hair shaving customers and giving hair and scalp treatments and under supervision practice on customers in school clinics students attend lectures on the use and care of instruments sanitation and hygiene chemistry anatomy physiology and the recognition of simple skin ailments instruction also is provided in communication sales and general business practices experienced barbers and cosmetologists may take advanced courses in hairstyling coloring the sale and service of wigs and hairpieces and sales and marketing after graduating from a training program students can take a state licensing examination which consists of a written test and in some cases a practical test of styling skills based on established performance criteria a few states include an oral examination in which applicants are asked to explain the procedures they are following while taking the practical test in many states cosmetology training may be credited toward a barbering license and vice versa a few states combine the two licenses into one hairstyling license many states require separate licensing examinations for manicurists pedicurists and skin care specialists for many barbers cosmetologists and other personal appearance workers formal training and a license are only the first steps in a career that requires years of continuing education personal appearance workers must keep abreast of the latest fashions and beauty techniques as hairstyles change new products are developed and services expand to meet clients needs they attend training at salons cosmetology schools or industry trade shows through workshops and demonstrations of the latest techniques industry representatives introduce cosmetologists to a wide range of products and services as retail sales become an increasingly important part of salons revenue the ability to be an effective salesperson becomes ever more vital for salon workers successful personal appearance workers should have an understanding of fashion art and technical design they should enjoy working with the public and be willing and able to follow clients instructions communication image and attitude play an important role in career success some cosmetology schools consider people skills to be such an integral part of the job that they require coursework in that area business skills are important for those who plan to operate their own salons

im wanting to start an orphanage childrens home i am wanting any info on it including legal issues in africa hi kirsty i've just been reading all your questions and it sounds like a cool idea lots of need for it my church are very involved with an orphanage out in uganda i've included the weblink so you can read about it and contact them if you want to ask and q's about how they go about it i know it's a different place to namibia but i imagine some issues will overlap it would seem good to me to test the water first i don't know how old you are how much experience you've had of living abroad in different cultures especially namibia who do you know out there as far as i can see it would be very challenging and dangerous to set up an orphanage anywhere on your own with no proper support network and even more so in a different culture it's tough demanding work how much experience have you already got of working in and supporting a namibian orphanage i don't want to put you off by all these questions cos i do think it's a great idea if you take things a step at a time with this ugandan orphanage day to day it's run by africans themselves we didn't start the orphanage it was initiated and funded by africans a few ppl from our church got to know people out there and decided to support it as the african leader was struggling so now we fund it teams go out to visit from time to time at the very least once a year we've initiated various projects over there building work latrine work beds a baby unit you could contact someone for exact details to run this orphanage day to day it costs per month there are kids there that's a very basic standard of living i think often they might just have one bowl of gruel type food in a day the orphanage has a school too so the money covers food accomodation and education i think fund raising has been a bit challenging but as a lot of people have got involved it's probably not so bad now we're a charity which probably makes it easier there's a reasonable supporter base we put events on get involved in local festivals several companies have shown support we run car boots etc etc it sounds potentially difficult to transport clothes goods etc over there we've had a lot of donations but so far it's seemed much better to largely just send out money and buy stuff over there more economical boosts the local economy however i know there has been talk of sending some containers out you could ask about that  Plame affair 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup Theory of conduct Economy of Namibia Microeconomics W.

what are the pros and cons of working for pampered chef i am looking into becoming a pampered chef seller and i need to know the pros and cons it's a big decision for me and i don't want to just jump in and lose money because of the start up cost and i choose not to do it any help would be appreciated i've been doing pc for years and have been a director for years my own personal experience has been excellent for a minimal investment of you get in product and supplies and as a new consultant you earn about per show at my current show average and as a director i'm earning about per show not bad for part time work i personally like to do about shows per week for the income i desire there is no hidden start up cost with pc i had a friend that was signing up with another direct sales company ds and when she met with her recruiter was informed that she had to come up with another and was told to get a loan start up cost is so little you can make that back in your first shows easy and as a host you can start for as little as no inventory if you do decide to stop selling you don't have a room full of inventory to get rid of i know of neighbor that had inventory from her ds business she had to take out a loan to purchase this inventory and she told me that even if she sold it all she would still not be able to pay off the loan as interest charges have accrued the biggest problem for me is that as consultants we can earn the new product that comes out twice a year for free i earned the entire set for free in june for our fall products and then earned another set as a director i'm running out of room in my kitchen to store my new products the nd set i'm giving away my sisters love me minimum monthly sales requirement i've heard of many ds companies that if you don't make the minimum monthly sales you are chased down to either sell what you need to make the requirement or pay for it yourself with pc there is a minimum sales requirement to stay active of every other month and if you don't meet it you will get a letter reminding you and then you go inactive you lose your career sales which of course you don't want to do but if you do that is your decision and no one chases you down or forces you to pay the difference you have months to submit in comm sales in month and you're active again i have teacher consultants that go inactive now and then during the school year and then reactivate during the summer and let's be honest every other month can mean a measly catalog show to stay active easy trips ok i thought i had to do shows per week to earn trips and be in the top level of management after all that is how it is with the ds companies i've read about in my first full year with pc i earned a trip to rome rome italy not rome georgia i've also traveled to alaska disney california mexico and the past trip i opted for the gift certificate as i had already been there and so i purchased a free laptop for myself and my family you do not have to be a director to earn a vacation with pc anyone can earn a trip and there are different levels you can earn an incentive by doing average shows per month top trips with just shows per month and let me tell you the trips are fantastic bookings i did a homeshow for a friend last year i had a guest sales show received in free product that same show with pc would have gotten me in free product half price items and unlimited at plus my choice of one of items at off i teach my team that you have to truly believe that our host plan is the best around people would be crazy not to book a show someone that is not getting bookings is not working their business the right away i have shows for september yes more than my usual per week but i want that london trip and i can rest when i'm in london the bookings are out there you just have to approach it the right way and they are there i make contacts per day no matter what the more people you approach the more confident you are and the more bookings you'll attract my mom was involved with a ds company when i was little the catalog changed every weeks and she had to hand deliver them with my dad waiting in the car in the cold snow and then when she paid for her order she kept the percentage she made she was concerned when i started pc and told me why with pc the catalogs change two times per year not times per month and i receive a real paycheck direct deposit times per month my mom said when she kept her percentage it was just going through her fingers and she was always having to buy supplies and throw out catalogs because they expired by the way my mom is behind me now i took her with me on my incentive trip a few years ago a trip to mexico which was an unbelievable trip for both of us how fun commission rate yes there are other company's that may have a higher commission rate but with pc i do not pay for any of my host benefits what the host gets for hosting her show is all paid for by the company and for me i have no deliveries everything is shipped directly to the host as for my yes you do have to do a little recordkeeping for your taxes but you will have that with any ds company i will say there are many tax write offs new recipes are out for the season i took a dish to my family reunion am trying one out on my family tonight all those i get to write off yes i get to write off part of my grocery bill there are many other tax write offs and so for me it has turned out that the money i would have paid in taxes has been offset by what i spent in expenses my business has never affected my tax situation negatively i wouldn't keep doing it if it did my mom is a tax preparer and can answer any questions you have about submitting your taxes for your pc business yes there are times when i don't want to get in my office to work or am tired and don't want to go to my show but my husband reminds me do you think they are going to pay you for doing nothing yes it is a job but even when i'm tired and am not in the absolute best mood driving to my show i get there and get started and i love it i have such a good time at my shows i used to sit at my desk in my office and dream of a flexible job that would pay good money and give me time with my family and i have it it allows me the opportunity to have my own schedule i'm able to volunteer at my daughter's school attend field trips take a day to go to the beach with my girls in the summer be home when they are off school with an illness the benefits way outweigh the disadvantages i had planned on going back to a real job btw i was a hr assistant had an office everything when my daughter entered full day kindergarten years ago but now they are busier then ever and i so enjoy helping out at the school and getting to know the teacher and their friends and being there for them when they get home from school at pm my husband has a day off next week during the week and we're taking our daughters on one day trip to a local amusement park i didn't have to ask my boss for the day off i am my own boss and i always say yes when i ask for the day off now i am a sahm but this business works for full time workers college students retired persons anyone and you don't have to know how to cook sometimes i still don't know how to cook we teach you how to prepare recipes and demo the products it's adult show and tell i understand your hesitation i remember years ago sitting in the kitchen talking to my husband about the exact same thing and his response was what do you have to lose you try it it is a minimal cost you get a bunch of free products you try a hand ful of shows and make commission what is so bad about that and it just might be your dream job i can tell you that standing looking at the coliseum in rome and sitting on a gondola with my husband in venice was certainly an indication that this was my dream job it could be yours too i hope i answered your questions and concerns i would be happy to help you

new ebay member got account questions i have no idea what i am doing i am selling something on ebay it says that i have an account balance after i listed my item i did not put a credit card on there and i won't i am just wondering is there any way to pay that balance out of the money i make on the item can it come out automatically once the sell is final if so how do i set that up like i said i really don't have any idea what i am doing i am new at this ebay thing please help me if you can thank you one more thing can you explain paypal to me i am really not understanding any of this hi i'm rather new to ebay too and i have a paypal acount my paypal account is linked to my checking account even though my papaly account balance is zero when i want to buy something off ebay it stil can deduct from my paypal acount which then deducts from my bank account since ther isn't any money in the paypal account itself or i can transfer money into my paypal account from my bank account but i've never felt the need to do so if you've made money on the item where did that money go into your paypal account log into paypal and see if the money is ther after the item sells then leave the amount of money in the paypal account which would cover the fee then after days ebay should automatically deduct that money from your paypal account if there isn't any money in your paypal account when ebay tries to automaticaly deduct it i believe paypal will take the money from whatever it's linked to like a credit card or checking account and then it wil pay ebay i hope i helped and didn't confuse you more  PayPal Internet fraud Credit card E-gold Phishing Electronic commerce Electronic money Something Awful Poker jargon Bank Advance fee fraud Liberty Dollar Neopets MapleStory Live 8 Skype Money supply EFTPOS Octopus card Mortgage Cheque Insurance Debit card Personal finance Taxation in the United States Flat tax Short selling Auction Mutual fund Wheel of Fortune Automatic teller machine Payroll Wal-Mart Finance FairTax Betting (poker) Monetary policy Surveillance RuneScape cheats Surplus value SmartRider Citigroup Topps London Underground Arbitrage $ale of the Century Health savings account Student loan Capital accumulation Derivative (finance) Microeconomics Matrix scheme United Kingdom corporation tax Baccarat ROM image Money Animal Crossing Productive and unproductive labour Primerica Financial Services Credit card fraud Food Stamp Program Bank fraud The Amazing Race Annuity 401(k) Western Union Bond Copyleft Micropayment Deflation (economics) Virtual economy Law of value Depreciation Online shop Corporation Supply-side economics Money creation Financial audit Gold standard Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Something Awful Forums RuneScape economy United States Postal Service Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Say's law E-ZPass Economics Logic Marshall Plan Fiat money GunBound MMORPG Backup Euro Tax SCO-Linux controversies Social Security (United States)

how much does it cost to start a mary kay business i am in grad school and thought i could make some money doing mary kay how is the best way to go about this hi i am a mary kay consultant i started in february so i have a good idea of the current costs your starter kit only costs but you need to place a order to actually be considered an active consultant that is retail you pay half price for everything also you need to order at least retail every months i think to keep receiving that price if you are going to get out there and start selling right away using your starter kit it's not hard to do but your director may suggest you place that order yourself so you can have more samples and inventory i really like mary kay but i do have to warn you that it is not a get rich quick company you can get a lot of money but it takes time and energy and most of the money comes from recruiting others you really have to get out there and meet people and sell they recommend giving facials in days as a power start mary kay is a great company but it does take a lot of time so maybe wait until after grad school to start i would rather you have a good experience with the whole process than feel duped and lose money because you just don't have the time to make it work for you hope this helped to receive bonuses an independent beauty consultant's initial order with the company must equal or more in wholesale section products to be eligible for the price that is retail you can wait and get that in actual sales but there is another free bonus for you if you place it within calendar days so yes the kit is but they expect you to place an order fairly soon and it does help you to have more stuff than just the starter kit  Wal-Mart Amway Economics Illegal drug trade Investment bank $ale of the Century Advanced Squad Leader Sears Holdings Corporation UK Singles Chart Inventory Retailer Microsoft Bulk vending Best Buy Inflation Mutual fund Xbox E85 Just In Time London Congestion Charge Electronic commerce Biodiesel The Apprentice 2 Nike, Inc.

professional photographers only please i'm going to start a photography business out of my home what do i do as far as licenses go things like that i just need to get pointed into the right direction thanks starting a business out of your home may require a local license at the city level or at the county or state levels depending on where you live you should first start with the most local jurisdiction your city hall call and ask if they have a city business license department and if the type of business you wish to run out of your home requires a business license it may depend on whether you plan on working as a freelance artist or if you plan on having customers visit you there may be many variables some cities do not require a license for what they would call minor home based occupations next check at the county and state levels they may require that you file a dba which is essentially a statement that you are doing business as a fictitious business name you may be required to post a legal notice in a local newspaper for a certain period of time also if you plan on buying wholesale supplies for your business or reselling then you may need to register with the state's tax board as well other considerations will be whether you want to do business as a sole proprietor or as an llc etc that will depend on the scope of your business and issues with taxes and other possible liabilities a financial planner and or an attorney can better advise you on what type of business structure to select from the beginning be sure to keep records of everything that you do get at least a dome weekly bookeeping record to keep track of income and expenditures and maybe even consider some reliable accounting software like quicken to help you keep things in order if you are working from home then you want to document your workspace like a designated office and determine what percentage of your home the space occupies a percentage of your home expenses such as utilities may be tax deductible for your business your financial planner accountant can better guide you with such issues keeping good records will just make things easier from the get go after you secure a license to do business at the city county or state level s then you will want to open a business bank account at a local institution try a local credit union first they often have easier requirements for opening business accounts and offer many free services that traditional banks do not not to mention your business will actually begin to build credit with the credit union be sure to keep all business expenses separate from personal expenses use your business account to pay all expenses from your business if you mix business and personal income expenses it can be very problematic the only expenses from your personal account should be the initial business license and the opening deposit on your business account visit some websites like entrepreneur com or the small business administration for more tips on starting a new business also check your local community for great opportunities and workshops for new businesses call your library or chamber of commerce to see what may be available in your area good luck in your new venture now go take lots of pictures build an awesome portfolio and get it online  United Kingdom corporation tax Credit card Microeconomics Mutual fund Taxation in the United States Surveillance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Personal finance Mortgage FairTax Student loan Political subdivisions of New York State Gross domestic product Child support Copyleft Government of Maryland Value added tax GNU General Public License Annuity Life insurance Economy of India Trademark Social Security (United States) Government debt Small business Information Technology Infrastructure Library Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Corporate finance National Insurance United States Postal Service Flat tax Intellectual property Limited liability company Capital accumulation Compiler optimization Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Economy of Russia Money supply Legal research Education in the People's Republic of China Security (finance) Capitalism Contract Electronic commerce Income trust Windows XP Enterprise content management Finance Public domain Cooperative Lawyer Islamic banking Social Security debate (United States) Expert system Microsoft Accountancy Citigroup Bond Bretton Woods system Education in the United States Economy of the United States Wal-Mart Education in Japan Scholarship Copyright Bank of China (Hong Kong) Income statement Medical prescription Bulk vending Toronto-Dominion Bank Cable television CPU cache Financial services Mergers and acquisitions Local government in the United Kingdom Privatization Intuit, Inc.

do women makes better entrepreneurs than men why the stats show there are more male entrepeneurs then female does that answer your question how many women are in the rich list a good entrepreneur is somebody that is successful in business at least that is my defination the old excuse is sexual discrimination but i can't accept that not in these modern times you have to take into account the mentality of a entrepreneur a succesful entrepreneur is expected to overcome all obstacles even sexual discrimination and besides if you are running your own business there is not going to be anybody above to discriminate against you either entrepreneurs are practical people problem solvers not excuse makers obviously there are plenty of exceptions to the rule anita roddrick and jacequline gold to name a few but past research shows that men tend to lean towards risk taking more so than women setting up your own business is a very risk venture especially in the first few years when bankruptcy is never far away i think women make good ceos once a business has been setup you need somebody with a cautious nature to take over and ensure its continued survival remember that being a ceo and being a entrepreneur are not always the same thing many ceos tend to be highly educated normally graduates from ivy league universities but this is frequently not the case for entrepreneurs although they are usually bright sometimes exceptionally so many do not even have a degree to their name while some even dropped out of school very early on normally a ceo plays by the rules an entrepreneur makes up their rules as they go along which men are better at doing how many of us men are in jail  Entrepreneur Sexual orientation Economic inequality Gender role Domestic violence Affirmative action Education in the United States Tufts University Strategic management Human Privatization Ross School of Business Entrepreneurship Social rule Theory of conduct Babson College Homophobia Fathers' rights Gender-neutral language Sexual dimorphism Indiana University Bloomington Economics Capitalism Brown University Bank Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Condom Intelligence quotient Human height Involuntary commitment Order of succession Intellectual property Graduate school Age disparity in sexual relationships Same-sex marriage Discrimination Microeconomics Sarbanes-Oxley Act Sexual attraction Price discrimination Quizbowl PRINCE2 Gay rights Sex Israeli Arab Labor theory of value Value system Capital accumulation Salic law Transsexuality Indigenous peoples Religion and sexual orientation Board of directors Corporate governance Baseball Bondage (BDSM) Pennsylvania State University University of Pennsylvania Coercion Dot-com Psychology Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Pornography Rape National Football League Mikhail Khodorkovsky Microcredit Monogamy Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Anarchism and capitalism Contract Reincarnation Scientology beliefs and practices Ryerson University Halting problem Abortion debate Ivy League Natural monopoly Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Consensus decision-making Venture capital The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Marriage Sex education Divorce Species American football Reparative therapy Religion Ethics Human sexual behavior University of Cape Town Abortion in the United States Insurance Extreme Programming Physical attractiveness America Online Atheism MIT Sloan School of Management Cornell University

how do i open up a food court restaurant i'm in the preliminary stages of researching how to open up a restaurant in a food court of a mall does anyone know any sites or good books to start off with i'm finding most of the books on restaurants are dealing with actual physical restaurants and not so much food courts i'm not interested in a franchise so i would just need info on what it takes to open a restaurant in a food court thank you firstly if you have no experience in the food court restaurant business i'd advise that you work in one for the next six months or so doing everything possible to get some of the work experience that you'll need to understand and run a food court restaurant profitably if this is your first business venture i would strongly recommend that you talk to a business counselor before you do anything especially spend money i'd call the local office of score go to http www score org and input your zip code to find the chapter nearest you the advice is free ask for someone who has a background in restaurants and they'll try their best to match you with the right counselor the counselor at score will most likely advise you to write a business plan which is very good advice because it will force you to dig out all of the start up details and the costs of starting a food court restaurant and force you to also understand all of the aspects of this business including the customers you'll concentrate on your market and how you'll get them to find out and want to come to your food court restaurant the location of the restaurant is important but doesn't make it successful to prove that all you have to do is walk down a food court where there are several restaurants all in a row and you'll find one or two that are empty while the others are very busy it has to do with menu ambiance and your reputation at the beginning and over time you also have to have food handling licenses the right city and county licenses and permits and you have to be skilled at negotiating with your landlord about who'll stand the cost of the build out or the changes to the premises to make it ready for your look and feel you also have to worry about the normal business planning and management issues related to starting up any business take a look and read some of the articles at http www ychange com small business consulting articles html especially the ones about a business plan and starting a business also try their blog and their bulletin board hope this helped  X Window System Restaurant Microsoft Software engineering Economics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus OpenDocument Strategic management Wall Street Mozilla Firefox Information Technology Infrastructure Library World Wide Web Common Unix Printing System Super Size Me Cross site scripting Privatization Scientology beliefs and practices McDonald's Plame affair Expert system Electronic commerce Software patent debate Intellectual property Open access Ryanair Food and Drug Administration United States Postal Service Fast food Citigroup Copyright Bulk vending Breastfeeding Publishing Tesco Unicode Domain Name System Public domain Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 7 Peer review America Online Mergers and acquisitions GNU General Public License Francis Crick Lloyd's of London Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Unemployment United Airlines SCO-Linux controversies Graduate school Monopoly (game) Airport Mozilla Application Suite Wget Mutual fund SAS System LiveJournal Corporate governance Government of Maryland Coffeehouse Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Internet Appeal Search engine optimization A&W Restaurants Warren Buffett Neville Chamberlain Microcredit Blog Bank Volleyball Organic farming Melvin R.

honest opinions about selling mary kay i am thinking about becoming a mary kay rep and i love meetng people and doing makeup and such but i have heard both good and bad what is your honest opinion plus it would just be a pt thing so i can have a little spending money i'm going to some meeting with my consultant tonight so i was just wondering what everyone thinks thanks i m looking for constructive criticism so if i do sell i want to know what people like and what they don t like i will be honest up front that i work for mary kay have you had any good experiences or bad ones let me know i m all ears also im a stay at home mom a full time college student i have done my research it's not like avon nor is it like that melaluca stuff wow um i talked to several directors and it doesn't cost to start holy cow i'm starting to think that some people have just had bad experiences w it and therefore don't like it i am a mary kay sales director and wouldn't do anything else i am typically very shy and have never been the pushy type and was able to earn two free cars and become a director working that way i agree with the previous post make sure you like your consultant and are willing to work very closely with her as your recruiter ask questions before you sign this will make your experience a postive one ask their thought on inventory activity level communication throughout your career do they contact you on a regular basis or is the ball in your court the reason i say this is because there are several directors out there that expect you to start with a large inventory which is fine if you feel comfortable with that and will only help you if you are doing a certain amount of activity don't get me wrong there are a lot of us out there that do not treat our consultants this way but as a brand new recruit you have no idea i am always open for questions i've been a consultant for seven years and a director for of those years i've worked my business while working a full time job while going to school and now as a stay at home mom i love it and if you have the right people to get you started it's an awesome company to work for  Theory of conduct Economics Karl Rove Poker jargon Time Out of Mind The Emancipation of Mimi Alcoholics Anonymous The Apprentice 2 U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Plame affair Mutual fund W.

please give me advice if i want to set up a small online bookshop oder music shop how much it cost to build up site when i hire any web designing company if you are aexpert you can mail me it really depends on how much help you would need with setting up the site at the very basic end you could spend as little as a few hundred pounds to get someone to put the pages together for you however if you need a lot more help and need someone to sort out your order system security etc as well as providing ongoing support this will cost thousands and will need to be on an ongoing contract basis i don't know how much research you've done into this but there are a few things worth considering advertising will be a big expenditure for you you will have to pay top prices to secure bids on searches like buy books even if you have a niche offering this will cost it is an incredibly competative market you will be competing against massive multinationals who have buying power to significantly undercut prices simply making a site isn't enough you will need to understand how to get this site visibly through organic searches search engine optimisation etc or you will need to pay someone to do this offline both music and book shops are struggling as supermarkets in particular are seriously undercutting them online some operators are doing well but many smallers ones are not be aware that selling to the uk market at least the likes of cdwow offer competative pricing by locating offshore i appreciate that sounds quite negative but its important you understand this before you spend time and money if you are serious about doing this then you will need to make a reasonable capital outlay in order to get it going as others have advised a much easier and safer to test the water at least is to sell it online through somone like amazon or ebay  Electronic commerce Microeconomics Economics Airline Search engine optimization Mutual fund Wal-Mart Gross domestic product MMORPG Spyware Insurance Tesco Amazon.com Surplus value CPU design FairTax Online shop Dot-com Web traffic Neopets Bond Capital accumulation Mac OS X Internet fraud L4 microkernel family Inflation Pharmaceutical company Free trade Tax Philatelic investment E-mail spam Life insurance Day trading Political economy Illegal drug trade Spam (electronic) Arbitrage Acorn Computers Supply and demand Stock IBM PC compatible Advance fee fraud Gmail Hyperinflation Asian financial crisis Management information system Finance Octopus card Atari 8-bit family Online marketing Commodore International Aldi Nuclear power Network effect Yahoo!

how do you get your film playing at small local theaters suppose i made an independent film would i need a license to rent it to local theaters and how would i get it on the big reels they use would it need to win a film festival to be shown how long of a film do you think you can make without a big budget most of the independents still run six figures and take off from there let's say you have made a film if you go to the independent movie houses you may be able to talk to the manager about a special showing offer it for free they are not likely to buy an unknown's work no matter how good he she will likely want to watch it first this is a long shot but stranger things have happened your amc regal and other franchised theaters are not likely to touch it because for them it is all about the income they can get from the film do you have community access television in your area these local independent stations are often looking for filler material or something new especially if it is locally produced that could generate a following and put you on the road to bigger and better things don't despair keep at it your personal drive and ambition are what will keep the dream alive until it happens for you good luck  Movie theater Serial Motion picture rating system Cable television Mystery Science Theater 3000 Monopoly (game) Wheel of Fortune Television syndication Craps ITV Lauren Bacall Canon (fiction) Our Gang Sharon Tate Fahrenheit 9/11 Widescreen Movie studio Filmmaking Anamorphic widescreen Theory of conduct RKO Pictures American Motors The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie IBM PC compatible Property (ownership right) William Shatner Reservoir Dogs Tokusatsu Jennifer Lopez Channel 4 Movie projector Cinema of Canada KTTV The Rocky Horror Picture Show Film KCAL-TV Anime Dream Theater Care Bears Luck AMC Theatres Media in Ireland Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Animation in the United States in the television era Martin Lawrence The Riordans Royal Rumble WGNT Last Action Hero November (film) Doctor Who spin-offs Petula Clark Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Reel Retcon Innocence: Ghost in the Shell Meat Loaf $ale of the Century The Price Is Right Star Trek Grand Forks, North Dakota B-movie GNU General Public License Scenes from a Memory Julia Stiles Radio drama Back to the Future St. Louis Cardinals Field of Dreams GoldenEye Nintendo MTV UPN The Jazz Singer Paramount Pictures WGTW-TV Cult film Trailer (movie) Manos: The Hands of Fate Cyberspace Samuel Goldwyn Social rule Paul W.

i saw an accountant for initial consultation a few weeks ago and w o warning she sent me a bill what to do i'm starting a company with a few friends and as part of the process i met with a few accountants a few weeks ago to select one for our company one of them decided to send me a bill for for the initial consultation i know it's customary for accountants to provide complimentary initial consultation she also did not warn me in advance that she was going to charge me for the initial consultation i think it's pretty unprofessional for her to just stick me with the bill i don't think that i should pay for something i did not agree to do i have to pay she has our to be company's name my name address if i don't pay will my credit be damaged i should also add that i was referred to this accountant by a friend who had just received a complimentary initial consultation from her i agree with another post i don't know that it's customary for accountants to provide a complimentary initial consultation but you could look at the content value for the time was it a get acquainted session and she asked alot of questions only with no advice or did you get some solid advice that could save you much time and money i would only kick back if there was little or no value to me in the interview otherwise pay up and what a cheap education for future meetings with professionals as well as saving your rep you may not have considered that professionals have only their time to sell so if you waste it when i help clients shop for a cpa we are very clear that the sessions are their chance to show us what they can do if a great opportunity came out of it we'd be willing to pay even if we then hire another firm  Internet fraud Plame affair Insurance Advance fee fraud Life insurance John Kerr Appeal Karl Rove Sydney Riot of 1879 Credit card Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) America Online Coalition Provisional Authority Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 6 L.

husband not including me in new business legalities implications my husband may be aquiring a business that he is currently working for the loan to purchase the business would be all inclusive with the business so it's no out of pocket expense for us it is a very complicated type of business that deals with legal stuff that i don't know much about he doesn't seem to like the idea of including me on the documents or making me a owner of the corporation he seems to think that i need to work there and we both know that we shouldn't work together what are the financial implications and legalities for further down the road if he owns this corporation i assume it would mean that he owns of the shares but where does that leave me as his spouse what if something happens to him what if the business goes under ect i do not think there are any major problems with him not including you in the family business he should draw up a document with an attorney to have a beneficiary who will receive x percentage of what's been saved this could include you children family or anyone he wants to give his saved money to if something were to happen to him this should be kept by the attorney with copies kept by both of you in several states a marriage is sharing so even though he can choose not to share his business the shares of stock would be shared between you meaning if you were to divorce you could theoretically ask to receive percent share this totally depends on the state in which you reside after my aunt divorced my uncle he was entitled to percent of her retirement that she had saved so even if his business is in his name only you would be sharing the income as husband and wife if the business goes under this will reflect on your credit just as much as it will his he should definitely file a will to make sure you are covered if something should occur and also where this would leave the business as well i unfortunately do not have a law degree but i know that in many states what is one spouses the other one has a part in i'm just not sure how a divorce would affect things if you are left off of owning the company if you both owned the business then it would likely be sold and the profit would be divided between you if you do not have a share in it he will still likely be required to pay you a portion of the profits  Insurance Divorce Taxation in the United States Stock Marriage Social Security (United States) Capitalism Life insurance Credit card Corporation Mutual fund Intellectual property Capital accumulation Concurrent estate Annuity FairTax Citigroup Bank Dividend Enron Corporation Trust (Law) USA Rupert Murdoch Mergers and acquisitions Tax Islamic banking Wal-Mart Security (finance) British Royal Family Surplus value Bond Cooperative Anarchism and capitalism Gross domestic product SCO-Linux controversies Common-law marriage Finance Family Corporate finance Short selling Same-sex marriage Privatization Flat tax Deflation (economics) Child support Warren Buffett Corporate governance Temasek Holdings Progressive tax Trust (Law) non-USA Financial services Polyamory Keynesian economics Same-sex marriage in Canada Inflation Public domain Labor theory of value Copyright Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland Plame affair Mortgage Wells Fargo Trademark Asian financial crisis Economy of Russia Amway Common criticisms of Microsoft Oil-for-Food Programme Eliot Spitzer Theory of conduct Digital rights management Supply and demand Donald Trump Karl Rove Arbitrage Royal Dutch Shell Bruce Johnson No-fault divorce Attorney at Law Money Federal Reserve Algerian Family Code Alimony Wealth Free trade Debt Great Depression Ownership

how do i attract more people to my lawn mowing service i started a few days ago and i've sent out flyers around no one called or e mailed me any tips and advice don't go with the popular business card answer i've already ordered some you could try putting your current customers to work for you assuming you have a few already offer your current customers a discount for any leads to turn into customers if they can give you 'x' number of leads that turn into customers offer a free cutting trimming etc if you are doing a great job then most people wouldn't hesitate to recommend your services to a neighbor family member co worker friend etc i am not sure of your age but you can ask your parents to recommend you to their friends if you are older and rent own a place then i am sure you have friends that are the same offer them the same discount mentioned above talk to real estate companies there's nothing like freshly cut lawn before an open house don't be surprised if most already have a 'yard man' but all can use a good backup hope this helps congratulation on starting a new business and good luck  Sears Holdings Corporation Lawn mower Wal-Mart United States Postal Service Frequent flyer program New York Giants Northwest Airlines Little Britain Call centre The Adventures of Pete & Pete Warren Buffett Friends Social rule Ocean's Twelve Pittsburgh Steelers Outsourcing Knots Landing Sydney Riot of 1879 Insurance Retailer Cheating in poker Eaton's Aerial (dance move) Craps Electronic commerce Plame affair Filling station Theory of conduct Celebration, Florida The Ashlee Simpson Show Telephone exchange Religious Society of Friends Wells Fargo Tariff Montgomery Ward Dead Putting Society Motion picture rating system Cleveland Browns Price discrimination Piccolo Junior Saga Mutual fund ITunes Music Store Betting (poker) Rent (musical) Customs and etiquette of Japan Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Abigail Folger Monopoly (game) Ashton-Tate Toronto-Dominion Bank Extreme Programming Satchel Paige Donald Trump Post office Property (ownership right) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Babylonian law Management Charmed Karl Rove President (game) Department store Eric Bischoff The Inside KCR Direct marketing Aldi Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tennis Samuel Goldwyn Good Times MTR Financial services Tobacco Humphrey Bogart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) George Costanza Tesco Billboard Hot 100 New York Jets Marketing Public transport Avenue Q Mad Money Offshoring RuneScape quests Poker jargon Boston Public Sento Network effect Sub-Zero Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Married... with Children 2004 Democratic National Convention Citigroup United Airlines Centrelink Parliament of the United Kingdom Draw poker

good name for a web design business here is your chance to name my business i am looking for an interesting and original name for a web design business thnaks name it as if you were a doctor a lawyer or a cpa john doe web designer among other things it means you don't need a second phone line for the business and you don't sometimes answer acme web design accidently when you answer your personal line or john doe on your business line among other things it tells potential customers that they aren't getting someone who wants to be anonymous it says you're proud of your work and you stand behind it among other things it lets you focus instead of hi i'm john doe of webdesigners web design giving potential customers two items of information to try to remember you simply say hi i'm john doe and i'd like to set you up with a website that pays instead of costs and it's easier for them to remember just the one name instead of two of course your name is more or less distinctive depending on who your parents were and how imaginative they were when i was i looked in the cincinnati phone book and found people with my birth name i changed my name later on but surprisingly when i started a business using my name as the business name within six months people found of those phone numbers responded with oh you want the great his phone number is the other numbers were disconnected of course it didn't hurt that i sent all people a gift and i asked them to redirect phone calls to me the one drawback to naming your business after yourself this way is that it makes it very difficult to sell for instance harlan sanders got sued by kfc after he sold the restaurant chain because he was trying to get back into the chicken business but it's virtually impossible to sell a web design business anyhow so you haven't lost much  Social rule Theory of conduct Plame affair Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Extreme Programming Electronic commerce Associative array Colonel Sanders Shaggy dog story The Apprentice 2 Insurance E-mail spam Telephone exchange Perl Little Britain Surveillance Philosophy of language Juris Doctor Public-key cryptography Humphrey Bogart Gross domestic product Voice over IP Public good Customer relationship management Web crawler Phreaking Google search XML Expert system Hash table Wal-Mart GSM services Unemployment Socrates Time Out of Mind Legal research Restaurant Call for help Rich Mullins Password Bluetooth Vertical service code Trademark Windows XP Windows 2000 Amazon.com Have I Got News For You Emergency telephone number McDonald's Kender Seven (film) Temporal database CPU design Neopets Friends Virgin Mobile Property (ownership right) Kentucky Fried Chicken Paul Hackett Internet fraud Stopping e-mail abuse Abortion in the United States Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Legal fiction FairTax Subscription business model Current teachings of Prem Rawat Hamburger Microeconomics Charles Goodyear Modem Copy protection Abortion debate Ex-gay SCO-Linux controversies Illegal drug trade Wheel of Fortune Bulk vending Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Objective-C Past teachings of Prem Rawat RISC Gmail Jean Schmidt Goodness and value theory Live 8 Plame affair timeline Ann Coulter Nuclear power Strategic management Anonymous P2P Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an City of Heroes EastEnders Spam (electronic) Roe v.
