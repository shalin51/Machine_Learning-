why do churchs have colored windows little panes of colored glass on their windows from my studies in art history the stained glass windows came from the middle ages or part of the renasainse period at that time before printing presses were created or were just being created not many people owned books or could read education was for the wealthy the masses of society could not afford it so the church in an effort to educate the masses to the gospel of christ or familiarize the lay people general population to the bible and it's stories they used the stained glass windows to illustrate the stories and teachings of the word of god to the common man kind of like the saying a picture is worth a thousand words this is not to say that the art form originated at that time period but its use in the windows of churches and cathedrals is most commonly associated with that time period we appreciate the art of catherdals and churches but we should all the more appreciate the levels of education we have in our society for to a certain extent the stained glass windows where a form of early education to the people of earlier time periods i hope this answers your question god bless and peace g  Stained glass Book of Mormon Bible Roman Catholic Church Mission (Christian) Mass (liturgy) Glass Christianity Martin Luther Notre Dame de Paris Comics Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints King James Version of the Bible Infant baptism Dispensationalism Tridentine Mass Community of Christ Lamanite History of the English Bible Religious Society of Friends Eastern Orthodox Church New Testament Eucharist Gospel Photography Protestantism Cathedral of Chartres Christian eschatology St. Raphael's Cathedral (Dubuque) Biblical canon Apocrypha Mary, the mother of Jesus A Course In Miracles Baptist Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu Holy Spirit Second Vatican Council Karl Barth Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Trinity Salvation Icon Justification (theology) Church of Christ, Scientist Gothic architecture Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Clergy Opus Dei Sola fide Theology Washington National Cathedral Genesis Gospel of Mark Shield of the Trinity Merit Christianity and anti-Semitism End times Original sin Nation of Islam Douai Bible Jan Hus Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Young Earth creationism Mormonism and Christianity Jesus John Howard Yoder William Carey First Vision Secret Gospel of Mark Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod John Wycliffe Gospel of Thomas Augustine of Hippo Purgatory Vulgate Immaculate Conception John Wesley Priesthood (Mormonism) Vespers Window Catholicism Leviathan (book) Mormonism Book of Kells Joseph Smith, Jr. Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Church of Christ Anglicanism Creationism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Revelation Predestination Liturgical year Blessed Virgin Mary United Church of Christ Alan Campbell (pastor) Mormonism and Judaism

using gimp to turn a pic into a sketch i am at this site http www gimp org tutorials photo to sketch and im stuck on number they have those five options masked highpass and etc but mine only has one in there and i cant figure it out will someone help or at least give me a site that teaches easier y'know it's kind of a shame that someone puts the effort into such a nice tutorial and doesn't bother to step through it themselves they omitted some obvious steps or at least glossed over them when you get to step and you see those options that you mention those are layers if you're not familiar with the concept each layer is like a perfectly clear sheet of paper that you draw on and they're all stacked together for the complete picture layers on top cover lower layers the bottom layer is the 'background' layer and as it has nothing underneath it it has no need for anything to be transparent so it's not that's what they mean by alpha each pixel in a picture has a certain amount of transparency and if it's transparent i e it has an 'alpha' then the layers beneath it are visible when the author says 'make a copy' he means 'make a copy of the layer' right click on a layer and choose duplicate layer if you click on the eye next to a layer it turns it on and off visible invisible be careful that you're on the layer you want to work on you can also delete the background layer or put a layer beneath it i suggest you try using some of the gimp forums for questions like this you might get a better response  PNG Traditional animation GIMP Windows XP Mouse (computing) Stereoscopy 2D computer graphics Gramophone record Macromedia Flash Poker jargon Rendering (computer graphics) Internet protocol suite Wireless Application Protocol Photographic film Minesweeper (computer game) HTTP cookie Opportunity rover IPod Mozilla Firefox Domain Name System Gaia Online Philosophy of language Screenshot Translation Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Redundant array of independent disks Independent Media Center Glacier History of the graphical user interface HyperText Transfer Protocol Inkscape Brewery On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences XML GIF Mattress EIA-708 Halo: Combat Evolved Uniform Resource Locator Ice core Cascading Style Sheets JPEG Geographic information system Netfilter/iptables HyperCard Humphrey Bogart Nintendo 64 Jumpstart 3rd Grade Morse Code Solar cell Theory of conduct Windows Vista Digital photography Slashdot subculture DVD Dance Dance Revolution Ethernet Scene graph Expert system Liquid crystal display Moir__ pattern Extreme Programming Mars Stairway Windows 2000 Nintendo DS PostScript Knoppix Manifold OpenBSD Virtual memory Mach kernel Quest for Glory Ajax (programming) Transport layer Glass Deconstruction BitTorrent C plus plus Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Sea ice Cheating in poker Copy protection Olduwan Solar variation One-time pad City of Heroes Floppy disk Common Unix Printing System Super Nintendo Entertainment System Solar eclipse Beatmania IIDX PHP

fashion design drawer i'm not sure if this is an actual job title but could someone be a fashion design drawer i mean your a person who just comes up with the designs and sketches for the clothes but it' snot your clothing line i hope that make sense if this is an actual career how do you get trained in it fashion design illustration is definitely an actual job most illustrators working in fashion design are not working on their own lines but rather working for a larger clothing company their designs are then pooled together and reviewed by a director or head designer who then decides which illustrations will get made most major art colleges offer courses in illustration and a number of them have specific fashion design tracks that you can sign up for outside of art schools you could look into reference books on fashion design and try and teach yourself this is a bit harder as you miss out on some of the fundamentals of art training and it is harder to get placed in a design studio without a college degree i hope that helps  Savannah College of Art and Design Fashion Institute of Technology Undergarment Royal College of Art Fashion design University of Central Florida College Air Education and Training Command Fashion Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design Physician Bill Peet Community college Librarian Juris Doctor Law school Oxford English Dictionary Art school Tai Chi Chuan Game programmer Professor Education in Germany El Lissitzky Reiki Software engineering Dublin City University Purchase College Education in the People's Republic of China Electrical engineering Australian National University Education in Portugal Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Bachelor of Arts University of North Carolina at Charlotte Modern dance Ryerson University Trinity College, Dublin Lyceum of the Philippines Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Teacher Haute couture Washington University in St. Louis Robert Altman School counselor York University Martial art CPU cache City and Guilds of London Institute Social aspects of clothing Education in the United States Chris Benoit Carl Barks Master's degree University of Alabama Graduate school Seneca College Advanced Placement Program Kingston University Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Entropy Gucci Chinese martial arts Luther College Grunge music Smith College Image Comics Billiards UCAS Larry Hama Raffles Institution O scale Academia University of Chester Marvel Comics Mac OS X Robert Hutchins Boston College University of Michigan Brown University Dog training The Apprentice 2 A Course In Miracles French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools GED Far Eastern University Rick Sternbach Linus Pauling Philadelphia University Robert E.

i want to drop out of college and become an artist how can i not end up a bum i don't want to go to college any more i'm sick of the crap money spent classes dropped bullshit grades i want to make art but that sounds like a hit or miss sort of thing we all know it if your art sucks that means no money i do have a day job but with my spare time i really want to make paintings for enjoyment and sale how do i do this the professional way how do i make money to support myself and my family with my art work if you want to be a good artist stay in school get an education you will probably be happier going to an art school where you can focus your time on your art art school is important because it offers the environment that will help improve your art by having others critique your ideas and skill art school offers opportunities to meet other artists and develop connections that will last you a lifetime most successful artists not only have an undergraduate degree but a graduate degree stay in school  Graduate school Master's degree Education in the People's Republic of China College No Child Left Behind Act Art Education in Germany Education in the United States Education in Hong Kong Johns Hopkins University Avenue Q University of Central Florida Harvard University Grade (education) Babson College Medical school University of Alabama Law school GED Northeastern University, Boston Georgetown University Live 8 Art school Harvard Division of Continuing Education Clark Atlanta University Carnegie Mellon University Education in Taiwan Billboard Hot 100 Affirmative action Bachelor of Arts Education in Japan University of Pennsylvania Shit Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism University of Maryland Baltimore County Tufts University Economic inequality Otterbein College American University Juris Doctor College admissions Software engineering Academia Florida Institute of Technology Trinity College, Dublin York University Homeschooling Air Education and Training Command Electronic Arts University of Houston Baruch College Western Kentucky University Capitalism Drew University Florida State University Modernism Chinese University of Hong Kong University of California, San Diego Cornell University Bilkent University Pennsylvania State University Columbia University The College of New Jersey Seneca College Trinity University (Washington, DC) Anarchism and society Australian National University Teacher Liberal arts Brown University Community college Emerson College University of Hawaii at Manoa Cooper Union Virginia Commonwealth University Regent University University of Notre Dame Education in Australia Franklin W.

how can i make my anime drawings look more three dimensional i'm just barely learning how to draw anime characters i am slightly impressed with myself because it seems i get better each time i draw being just a beginner i'm only drawing faces right now and as i walked past and glanced at my latest drawing i noticed something i disapprove of it looks too flat two dimensional not much life to it not only am i a beginner in anime but i'm a beginner at drawing period so i don't really know how to shade properly which i think may be one of my problems the other being they're always facing forward no angles if those are the cases can anyone give me some pointers please feel free to im or email if you'd like to discuss it many thanks in advance it has taken me years to figure that out my strength in the very beginning was machines then with faces i had to learn to shade and make the picture appear to have more than just the flat look for example when you draw clothes jewelry glasses make them fit the body as if they were your own drawing a necklace straight across makes your character appear to have a detachable head round the necklace or watch around the neck or wrist show the other side of a characters cheek and eyes make the lips smaller as they get to the furthest side of the face eyes as well i use my wife as shadowed reference by having her sit under a lamp in the same position as my character this tells me where to add the shadow and how much to add  Aerial (dance move) Suplex Diving Drawing Shogi Swingout Poker jargon Volleyball Scapula Humerus Violin Equine conformation Strap-on dildo Akuma (Street Fighter) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Billiards Computer animation Horizontal bar Weight training Skateboarding trick Linked list Shaggy dog story Drill bit Lighting Hair Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)

how do i draw a sunset on a lake i want to draw a sunset on a lake and i am having trouble drawing it i dont really know how to draw a lake it just seems like blue water because i dont know how to draw waves and ripples im not a very good drawer so i would like some tips on drawing lakes and sunsets thanks okay say you're using colored pencils not sure what you're using but for sake of an answer always start with your sky the very top of your page would be basic sky blue as you get lower start coloring very lightly to fade out the blue to white then add yellow very faintly to blend from blue to yellow then add whatever color you want your sunset to be orange red purple pink etc you can include the sun just sinking if you like by using very bright yellow don't draw a circle just a nice bright glow stop a little below the mid line of the page in a straight line across the page like someone just cut across the page and it's suddenly white the rest of the way down now you're ready for your lake take a blue pencil same color as the top of your sky and draw the water line across where your sky stopped fade out at the middle or wherever your sun is glowing the brightest then fade in as you go across the page ending the same shade as you started on the opposite side use whatever colors you put in the sunset and mirror the colors in the water for instance if you have a gold colored glow for the sun make a gold colored glow in the water just beneath the sun then when that color changes to pink make the water pink around the gold glow in the water that is the sun the water then fades to blue just as your sky above faded to blue only it isn't as if you're looking at it straight but as if it were colored on a square sign facing you and then someone laid the sign at an angle on its back so it slants away from you sorry it's hard to describe without being able to show you if you then want to make the water look real add a lot more blue and deeper shadows to it at the edges you can add grass trees or other details in the foreground very bottom of your page if you like waves and ripples are hard to make look real the key is keeping your pencil moving left to right very straight not at all in a curved stroke or it will look like blue hay instead of water to make ripples leave the top of a wave white and color in the bottom part of it fading darker to blue again straight lines across is how you make it look real look at a photo if you're having trouble good luck hope this helps look at a photograph if you're still stumped  Billiards Color Light-emitting diode Wassily Kandinsky Snooker Leaf Colours, standards and guidons Opportunity rover Color theory Dragon Booster Rainbow Extraterrestrial skies Polarization Sundial Color temperature Professional wrestling holds Hangul Lightsaber Power Rangers Pysanka Mario series enemies Volleyball Fast bowling Pink Floyd Diamond Boy's surface Upholstery Sunglasses Tai shogi Knife Red Shaggy dog story Paramount Pictures Photography Parallax 2000 Australian Grand Prix Rock (music) CIE 1931 color space Aerial (dance move) Skateboarding trick Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Traditional animation Yellow Grace Cossington Smith Buffalo Bills R-Type Sun Textile manufacturing Fantasmic!

how can i write with a metallic caligraphy pen i have two and i have never been able to write with them i have the ink and stuff and i dip it in there but i just seem to scrape the paper what am i doing wrong it can be quite difficult to start with if you are beginner try and start with the largest nib you have assuming that you have pens with interchangeable nibs don't dip the pen into the ink because that is a way of overloading the nib and getting blobs use a brush to put some ink in behind the nib shake it gently when you put the nib to the paper wriggle it around a little until the ink starts to flow it can be quite frustrating until then i understand completely  Fountain pen Ballpoint pen Dip pen Pen and ink Calligraphy Tattoo Ink Pen Shodo Mimeograph machine Writing Invisible ink Milton H.

do you think the ability to draw is significant if i want to take major in design graphics i'm in college for a graphic design right now i can tell you it certainly helps to have a background in art and to be able to draw it's not because you're going to be drawing a lot though it's the skills that you use to make a good drawing that really help when designing being a good photographer would help too things like a good knowledge of color and composition a mastery of visual hierarchy and knowing what catches someone's eye those are all great talents to go into design with however i do know a few great designers who couldn't draw if their life depended on it all in all i think being able to draw in itself has little to do with being a good designer as long as you're willing to take the extra time and effort to learn the things that the artist types already know  Art Graphic design Graphics Drawing Color blindness Savannah College of Art and Design El Lissitzky Traditional animation Manga DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Stereoscopy Color Digital art Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Drew Struzan Artemisia Gentileschi Aphasia Norway national football team Graphic novel Wassily Kandinsky CPU cache Piet Mondrian Wolfrider Photography Martial art Web design Requirements analysis Carl Barks Jon Secada Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Time Out of Mind Mixed martial arts Graphics processing unit Extreme Programming M.C.

what should i learn to be a graphic designer i work on corel draw and adobe photoshop i have an artistic eye but i feel that is not enough i want to become an expert on illustrations design graphics where should i be start thank's everybody work on get a graphic design degree there is a lot more to being a graphic designer then just being artistic or knowing the programs and having an artistic eye though of course those help you need to know typography specifically when to use them and how to lay them out properly on a page you need to know how the print industry works and how prepare you projects for print you need to know how to properly present your work to clients in both a speaking role and how to lay out your work for presentation you need to know colors specifically the technical aspects of colors such as pantone colors so you know what colors to use in projects rather than just any color that you come up with on occasion you will need to know how to assemble projects by hand because comping the art of creating a demo product for client presentation is also expected of a graphic designer quite frankly illustration is often the easy part of graphic design a degree will help you learn a lot of the details of the business that you may not figure out on your own fyi the industry standard these days leans more heavily towards adobe illustrator than corel draw just to let you know and it's just as important to know how to use desktop publishing programs like adobe indesign as the illustration programs that you are familiar with  Graphic design Adobe Photoshop Drawing Desktop publishing Microsoft Office Adobe InDesign Portable Document Format Scalable Vector Graphics Graphics Adobe Illustrator OpenDocument PostScript X Window System Corel Game programmer 2D computer graphics Vector graphics editor Ebook Apple typography GIMP OpenType Software engineering Apple Macintosh Markup language Typesetting WordPerfect Logo Cascading Style Sheets Opera (web browser) Extreme Programming Linux Screenshot Computer-aided design PNG Adobe Acrobat Requirements analysis Tagged Image File Format GIF Common Unix Printing System QuarkXPress El Lissitzky Digital art Construction Game development Mac OS X Trademark Apple Computer BASIC programming language M.C.

is this a good drawing on microsoft paint i'm and female and hoping for a career in graphic design or art and decided to do this in my free time i didn't use a tablet to draw it just a plain old mouse and a copy of microsoft paint took me about an hour in total is it any good comments or ratings would be good thanks http www youtube com watch v kdbtohrnjs i don't know squat about computer aided drawing cause i'm in fine arts but it looks pretty dang good to me the only thing i might change is to speed up the sequences from one color over lay to the next because it seemed a teensy bit slow i felt like i was waiting too long for something to happen other than that the actual drawing of the car was excellent make sure you bring a dvd copy of this to put into your portfolio in case you apply at any art or design schools also if you do do this make sure you change the handwritten type to something more professional looking good luck i think you have a bright future ahead of you  IBM PC compatible CPU cache Original Amiga chipset Theory of conduct ATI Technologies Poker jargon Digital art Apple Computer Ebook Mouse (computing) Ashton-Tate PlayStation 2 Time Out of Mind Computer animation Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Ra (board game) Windows XP Computer chess Intellectual property Screenshot Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Microsoft Windows Social rule Graphics TRS-80 Color Computer History of Microsoft Windows Photography Domain Name System 2000 Australian Grand Prix NVIDIA Microsoft Paint Logo programming language JPEG Tablet PC Graphic design Wassily Kandinsky Jumpstart 3rd Grade 2D computer graphics Nintendo Wallpaper group Endgame Computer virus Web crawler Art The Star Wars Holiday Special Ben Johnson (athlete) World Wide Web Traditional animation Atari 8-bit family Xbox Traffic light Computer The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Milton H.

how to reduce the effects of textured paper and color pencil on final image hi i need to send a few illustrations to be printed these illustrations were done on textured for water color paper with colored pencils and some water color the end result is too textured you can see the paper texture very clearly in the scanned image can you suggest a way to reduce the texture and make the surfaces more uniform without blurring the drawings it could be on photoshop or other software packages that you know and love thanks adi try live trace in illustrator if you have flash it also has a trace function if you choose a high number of segments and colors it will look pretty good and sharp because you are converting it to a vector image choosing a low number of colors can look pretty cool also illustrator is a big more complex but the image export in flash isn't that great but it's fine if you export as a png  Drawing Traditional animation Rendering (computer graphics) Adobe Photoshop Graphic design Laser engraving PNG Wood Graphics Shader Bryce Digital image editing Drew Struzan Computer graphics JPEG Stereoscopy Etching Photography Digital photography Pottery Computer animation Surrealist techniques Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Nextoons: the Nicktoons Film Festival Explosive material Tofu Aliasing United States dollar CPU cache Adobe Illustrator Fire extinguisher Sega Saturn ImageMagick Lighting Oscilloscope Nintendo 64 Xbox 360 Ebook Printed circuit board Inkjet printer GIMP 3D computer graphics PlayStation Portable Tattoo Pencil Normal mapping Macromedia Flash Endgame Printmaking Vector graphics ASCII art Pixelation Nintendo Entertainment System Inkscape Igneous rock Typewriter GIF Dither Konica Minolta USB flash drive Diamond cut Pixel Vector (spatial) Compiler optimization Nintendo GameCube CMYK color model ATI Technologies Enlarger Sudoku POV-Ray Xbox One-time pad Automatic number plate recognition Portable Document Format Scalable Vector Graphics Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Commodore 64 Pastel Graphics processing unit Racetrack (game) Central processing unit Opportunity rover Color printing Game Boy Advance Vector graphics editor Paint Plastic Fiberglass Paper Enterprise content management Trademark Gross domestic product M__bius transformation Symmetry

do you consider an anime style to be art this is a question that has been asked countless times and i just want to know your take on it do you think that people who draw with an anime style should considered true artists by your definition not mine try to give reason as to your answer for those of you not so savvy by anime style i mean a drawing style that is similar to the kind you see in anime shows some shows that may ring a bell are dragon ball z salor moon naruto pokemon and other shows like this just a little extra background here i concider myself to be more of a cartoonist rather than an anime artist but i can't deny the fact that i have anime roots ever since picking up a how to draw manga book in rd grade i'm a year member on deviantart com which is filled with anime art as well as other styles and often times you run across that one person who bad mouths anyone with an anime style i don't watch much anime these days i don't watch any current series and my favorites are the little known last exile and the hilarious azumanga daioh i read a lot of manga though and an equal amount of american comics just to keep myself balanced and tend to like mangas more than anime another reason i'm asking this question is because both my art teachers disregarded my cartoony style as not art and assumed i did nothing else even though i'm constantly doing realist art as well and this bothers me while anime manga does get a lot of flak from art schools and such it is still art art is applying a medium with an attempt at creating something however it gets a bad rap because many of the fans have misguided view that drawing anime simply memorizing the flat symbols without learning traditional standards of art all of the good artists who draw anime have knowledge of the fundamentals of art like anatomy lighting perspective composition etc you should look the works of masashi tanaka who has graduated in the fine arts http www geocities co jp playtown king html this is his comic book illustrations http lambiek net artists t tanaka masashi htm no matter what style you have to draw realism if you know your anatomy you will have better command over any style you choose everyone's taste in art and perception in art will differ so whether anime is art or not is subjective to personal opinion your teachers probably have a bias against cartoons in general  Manga Azumanga Daioh Anime Comics Drawing Martial art Art Philosophy of mathematics Postmodernism Dragon Ball canon Whose Line Is It Anyway?

how to draw people is there any site that shows an idiot proof way to draw people they dont have to look really realistic but just give a starting point to get better thanks well if there's one thing i know it's that everyone has his her own style of drawing for example search jhonen vasquez on any image website and take a look at his drawings search todd macfarlane and take a look at his drawings and you can see that both have an individual style of their own as for drawing people may i suggest going to http www learn to draw com drawing people to the side it has a bar with various names like introduction symmetry etc but it should give you a head start and may i suggest using creativity just to form that drawing from a simple realistic and logical pose to anything you want something that looks awesome something pretty or like me something so twisted and horrible you can't look away just find your own style of drawing but use this sight as a reference arkham j scrotes  Invader Zim Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Prank flash Jhonen Vasquez Uniform Resource Locator Existence Logic World Wide Web SpongeBob SquarePants Projective transformation Drawing Halting problem Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Cissoid of Diocles Problem of universals Regular polytope Website Gauge theory Philosophy of language Roswell UFO incident Python programming language Traditional animation Indecent pseudo-photograph of a child Wallpaper group Identity Crisis (comics) Expert system RuneScape quests Peter Shilton Storytelling Web design HyperText Transfer Protocol Milton H.

what medium may i use to design for a tshirt screenprint i am designing a tshirt for our small club and we worked out a design i'm pretty good at art ok no training but i'm still not bad but i don't know how to get my idea on paper i'm wondering if i can do it in oil pastels so it has a sketchy feel or do i have to ink it with markers or something or nowadays is it best that i just do it on the computer which wouldn't be as fresh at least for the way i work any insights would be great this design is going to get silkscreened on i believe but i am not the tshirt ordering person i would do it on computer because most tshirt screenprinting places need digital files of the image to be printed if you want that sketchy feel try playing around on a program like photoshop they have different textures of brushes you can draw with i once designed a club tshirt a few years ago in high school if i remember correctly it must be in digital file format probably a photoshop file psd or jpeg i had originally painted my design on paper but the tshirt printer guy made me scan it and fix it as a digital file he also made me do several black and white files for each color i want to use for ex say you have red and yellow as the colors of your printed design make a image file of just the red parts in black and a second one of just the yellow parts in black i think it's because they need to separate the colors when they print it and all i dunno if your particular screenprinting place will make you go through all of that but that's what happened for me hope it helps  Screen-printing Printmaking Adobe Photoshop 2D computer graphics Drawing Inkjet printer Typewriter Digital photography PNG Color printing ImageMagick Computer printer Digital camera Photography Traditional animation Piet Mondrian Gamut Ebook Pastel Digital image editing Common Unix Printing System Pixel CMYK color model Color Color theory Microsoft Paint Graphic design RGB color model System/34 Fischer Random Chess Digital art Raster graphics Compact disc Tagged Image File Format Photocopying Printed circuit board Game Boy GIF Raw image format Ink Francis Bacon (painter) Vehicle registration plate Pretty Good Privacy Billboard (advertising) Paint Drew Struzan GIMP Steganography IPhoto Color space Trademark CPU cache Apple Macintosh Portable Document Format Printing press Fax Screenshot PlayStation Portable Dither Konica Minolta File format Graphics Digital circuit Adobe Systems Dot matrix printer Dots per inch Nintendo GameCube Mac OS X Black Computer virus Pixel art JPEG 2000 Comics Typeface Photographic film Euro banknotes Stereoscopy Cascading Style Sheets Laser printer Painting Apple IIGS System/36 Image scanner Geographic information system Floppy disk Punch card H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Copyright Color management ITunes Ukiyo-e Digital rights management DVD Enlarger Computer file

get inspired to draw again so i've been having a drawers block for awhile i really don't know how to snap out of it and get back into the game any advice i know how you feel and i hate the feeling my advice to you is to take a class no matter how skilled you are you can always learn something new your art teacher will give you different assignments depending on what kind of class you take you could do it through a recreation department or through your local community college this may help to get your mind going again if you travel then use that as your inspiration draw the people places and experiences you come across this sounds a bit silly but when i am stuck in the house and i need an idea i will stare at the stucco plaster on the ceiling until i see something and i will draw that do you have friends who are artists as well you could do a collaborative piece together if you can't get together with them have them email you a bunch of weird rules for a painting i e you can only use primary colors you must have three straight lines stretching from one side of the canvas to the other it must be in mixed media it has to be a comment on current political or social situations etc and you do the same for them then e mail pictures of the paintings to each other to see how they turned out i hope this helps  Drawing Stucco Art John Cage Martial art Skinny Puppy Transactional analysis Georges-Pierre Seurat Piet Mondrian Wassily Kandinsky Shaggy dog story Social rule Billiards W.I.T.C.H.

can i become a manga artist even though im spanish american i've been drawing since preschool seriously and im years old im a very great artist and since rd grade i've been learning how to draw manga now im going to seventh grade and im a little more serious about drawing and nervous i asked my self many questions untill it came to one that brought down my confidence in becoming a manga ka will i be accepted as a manga ka even though im spanish or from america please answer t t im losing confidence here and i need some answers t t ok thanks if answer d it depends are you looking to be a manga artist in the us or japan the two biggest markets if japan or another asian country where is popular like korea or china obviously you'll need to learn that native language there's a high percentage of manga artisits in these countries but for the most part they're assistants and they get worked like dogs but it can lead to bigger better things the main thing is to keep drawing and then attend an art school you may have natural talent but school will teach you the more technical details of the art business i e perspective storyboarding storylines etc school is also a great place to make connections with people in the industry and will help you get a foot in the door you may also want to consider putting yourself out there as much as possible you can do this by putting up a portfolio of your work on line or maybe starting a web comic of some sort remember the more work you put out there the more likely someone will see your work and maybe hire you who knows you may even develop a following on line and be able to support yourself off of your own projects you wouldn't be the first one to do this  Manga Comics Education in the United States Education in Taiwan Education in the People's Republic of China Yu-Gi-Oh!

does anyone know where i can get design templates online i want to do some clothes designing but need templates because i have trouble drawing the body shape i'm though and need them free or somewhere to copy them from hi i tried to answer this question for someone else recently a lot of people looked into it and it seems that there are not a lot of free templates going online but you can if you have the means buy expensive books of them so my idea was why not make you own find some fashion photographs or drawings that you like that preferably show the arms and legs quite a bit trace them off add a good dark outline and you can then use them as templates for creating designs if you don't want to use tracing paper and i imagine you don't have a lightbox you can always tape them up on a window and trace for the same effect using ordinary paper kitchen greaseproof paper by the way works just as well as tracing paper and is a lot cheaper i really don't think this is plagiarism just a learning curve so long as you don't try to sell them as original fashion drawings good luck  Traditional animation Theory of conduct CPU cache Clothing Violin Don Rosa Strap-on dildo Microeconomics Drill bit Philosophy of language Drawing Altruism The nature of God in Western theology Spline (mathematics) Origin belief Social rule Bass guitar PostScript African American Vernacular English Scientology beliefs and practices Logo programming language BASIC programming language Star Trek Customizable Card Game MP3 Reality Copy protection Academic publishing Book IBM PC compatible Plagiarism CPU design Ebook The Crying of Lot 49 Gaia Online Barbie Wood carving 2000 Australian Grand Prix Apple typography Immanuel Kant Hangul Perl Extreme Programming Garth Brooks Gramophone record H.

how do you judge a manga i heard that some people judge a manga by their drawing style or how tidy the drawing are i don't know which of them are the best frankly speaking i don't really care much about the drawing style it's the plot that gets me no matter how beautiful the drawings are if the story's all cliche then it's no use however a brilliant mix of the story plot including the flow of the story and the artwork would be the best criteria in judging a manga  Manga Megatokyo Anime Hentai Transactional analysis Time Out of Mind Ghost in the Shell Trigun InuYasha Maria-sama ga Miteru Dragon Ball Comics Harry Potter Judge Dredd Mary Sue Urusei Yatsura Mamoru Oshii Rurouni Kenshin Seramyu CG artwork Pitaten Academic art One Piece Chobits Gekiga Yu-Gi-Oh!

logo copyright question if i'm designing someone's website or ebay store and they sell brand name clothing and or accessories is it legal to put the designer logo somewhere on the page to show customers what brands they carry or is that infringement also if someone sells video games or something is is ok to use images of the video game characters on the web page i think thats considered infringement but i've seen it before so i just wondered thanks i'm not the one who wanted to use the video game characters i just saw them used on a website somewhere and wondered about it well everyone has a fairly fuzzy knowledge of this but a good rule of thumb is to remember your not selling their logo but their product the first thing is that logos aren't as important as the product but sometimes they do matter you can use most logos without permission if dealing with their product just so long as you do not claim ownership or use it in a way that uses their name to sell your own products services using the disney logo on a doll that was not made sold by disney that said logos are very sensitive since they represent the coperate identity you are representing threw their products you may need to get permission to use it from the coperation and the easiest way to find out is to ask email them they might even give you a better graphic to use as far as video game characters this is an entirely different beast you are falling into an area where you honestly don t have the rite to distribute the information usually its ok to post official press release images screen captures which have been un edited though character art such as desktops and un released content such as screen caps of cut scenes for instance might make the developer mad a rule of thumb for video games which seems to be widely used is to use press release material you can use photographs you take though usually that is only of the entire product case disc manuals ect photographs do not apply to characters and other content unless you have permission to post it again ask for permission you might be surprised what they say i'm no expert and i don't pretend to be and i hope someone more knowledgeable can correct anything i've said in error  Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Apple Computer Google Digital rights management Pretty Good Privacy Nintendo SCO-Linux controversies Theory of conduct Trademark Windows 2000 MAME Enterprise content management Sega Dreamcast Fair use Microsoft Public domain Windows XP Copyright Screenshot Warez PlayStation 2 First-sale doctrine Copy protection Intellectual property Photography Sega Saturn PlayStation Portable Apple typography Floppy disk Expert system Commodore International DVD PlayStation 3 ROM image Computer Resident Evil (video game) XML IBM PC compatible Logo Internet fraud The Star Wars Holiday Special Pok__mon (anime) Spam (electronic) Censorship in Australia Xbox 360 AmigaOS Atari 8-bit family Nine Inch Nails Copyright law of the United Kingdom Yu-Gi-Oh!

a good story to illustrate i want to practice illustration and drawing and would like to do it by illustrating a story it can be any type of story try to start with very old children stories that don't have any copyright like hansel and gretel alice in wonderland etc and what i would definitely do is not look at reference from previous illustrators when i was in school they gave us stories that already existed and were printed and illustrated and we weren't allowed to look at anything any artist had done because then your work is going to be always tinted with that because in your head you are going to think about these other people that had done it before you so try to avoid that or watching movies such as alice in wonderland from walt disney or even looking at the mary blair illustrations that she did for the movie that they never actually used i hope this helps you and have a lot of fun drawing take care  Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Carl Barks Alice in Wonderland (1951 film) Don Rosa Walt Disney Alice Liddell John Tenniel Peter Pan Bill Peet Hansel and Gretel Walt Disney World Resort Through the Looking-Glass The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Winnie-the-Pooh Extreme Programming Alan Moore Mickey Mouse Mervyn Peake Alice Comedies Brothers Grimm Harlan Ellison Resident Evil (film) Drawing Colleen Doran Pen name Griffin Copyright The Walt Disney Company Fantasia (film) Disney's Nine Old Men Sherlock Holmes Fairy tale Pinocchio Donald Duck Disneyland Mary Poppins Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Drew Struzan Mixtape Plagiarism Spirited Away Mickey Mouse Works The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age) Disney-MGM Studios Witches (Discworld) Hansel und Gretel Care Bears Silly Symphonies Wonderland (McFly album) Dakota Fanning Aladdin (1992 film) Photography Digimon Oswald the Lucky Rabbit William Blake Anime Comics Pogo Disney comics Novel Cheshire cat Dorama L.

how do i draw a straight clean line say for instance you are drawing a line and you want it to be very clean without the line being shaky or off course how do i go about that i've already tried using my whole arm to draw but somehow my arm is even more shaky i only use my whole arm when i am doing a rough pencil sketch please note i do not intend to use straight lines for design purposes but illustration purposes i draw cartoons not plans for houses i assume you mean freehand commitment is what it takes you draw the line quickly and from point a to point b practice practice practice and thenit will happen you have to feel the line before it can be drawn just as the archer feels the target before he lets fly the shaft  Drawing Archery Ammunition Perspective (graphical) Knife Comics Wassily Kandinsky Strap-on dildo Extreme Programming Cartoon Heraldry Sin City Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Poker jargon Textile manufacturing Racetrack (game) Volleyball Computer and video game genres Paranoia Agent Dr. Seuss Jam (TV series) Nuclear weapon Ron Weasley Draw poker Kyudo Battle of Agincourt Wind turbine Adobe Illustrator Whose Line Is It Anyway?

what is good software for logo design i heard adobe illustrator is good but has anyone tried it to any success what are the pros cons to it any others thanks i personally like macromedia fireworks for fast logos it is very easy to pick up various pieces and move them around without clicking on layers i can bring it into flash and create some movement then i can save it as a gif for a moving logo on a website here is an example of a logo i created some while back using fireworks and flash http www coblercorp com i created the image of all the computer pieces on the side in photoshop on the other hand adobe illustrator is the pro when you just can't settle for anything less than the best because it is so compatible with adobe photoshop the effects are endless the tricky thing is learning to use the pen tool once you have that mastered you need to master how to make lines go under and over each other it's best to take a college class if you've never worked with this type of software as it can be a bit difficult a good professor can teach you a lot of shortcuts well worth the investment if this is your career  Adobe Photoshop Macromedia Flash Graphic design PNG Macromedia Fireworks Drawing Adobe Systems GIMP 2D computer graphics Adobe Illustrator Web page Opera (web browser) Screenshot IBM PC compatible IPod Adobe InDesign Portable Document Format GIF Game programmer ASCII art Scalable Vector Graphics Trademark ColdFusion Web design Stereoscopy Apple typography Traditional animation Paint Shop Pro Web browser Finale notation program Tagged Image File Format Graphics Product activation Goatse.cx Ajax (programming) Software engineering JavaScript Final Cut Pro B3ta Photoshopping MP3 Nextoons: the Nicktoons Film Festival Adobe Acrobat Desktop publishing Website AmigaOS Extreme Programming Computer virus Web template Apple Computer Mozilla Firefox Microsoft Office Mac OS X Plugin Software documentation Apple Macintosh Python programming language Vector graphics editor Floppy disk Rich Internet Application Logo programming language Computer graphics BitTorrent HTML PlayStation 3 PlayStation Portable Ebook Casting Version Quake III Arena HyperCard E-mail Wallpaper group Java programming language WordPerfect Windows Vista Atari 8-bit family Commodore 64 Drill bit QuickTime Endgame Read-only memory Free software Motorola 68000 Unicode VJ Embedded system Internet Relay Chat DVD Computer CPU design Secure Digital card University of San Francisco

french impressionism what were some cultural effects of french impressionism please list as many as you can impressionism began in painting with claude monet's artwork and eventually was taken over in literature especially poetry music sculpture and in other fields of art even in film a little later because impressionism was concerned with capturing one moment in time and its philosophy affected the artist's relationship to their artwork time was no longer an objective entity following its own track but there would be a splitting of time into objective and subjective time that could now be represented in art the artist's focus was no longer to present a picture of something as it is but to render it as if frozen in time while preserving the impression of the moment thus art had become subjectified through the eye of the artist and this new perspective was to be attacked later by expressionism which was a direct effect of impressionism  Art Impressionism Western art history Modernism Claude Monet Academic art Cubism Pablo Picasso Drawing Symbolism (arts) Ukiyo-e Digital art Modern art Degenerate art Photography Wassily Kandinsky Reality Graphics Kitsch Neoclassicism Art of Ancient Egypt French art of the 19th century Meaning Aesthetics Philosophy of language Prayer Harlem Renaissance Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Cinematography Korean art Art in Ancient Greece __douard Manet Dada Michel Henry Baroque Literature Surrealism Hierarchy of genres Renaissance Perspective (graphical) Social psychology Culture of China Martin Heidegger African art El Lissitzky Maurice Merleau-Ponty Pre-historic art Rococo John Singer Sargent George Moore (novelist) Diego Vel__zquez Fine art Buddhist art Deconstruction Stereoscopy Age of Enlightenment Traditional animation Drew Struzan Pierre-Auguste Renoir Japanese art Music Philosophy of mathematics Francis I of France Postmodernism Depth of field Logic Henri Cartier-Bresson Bullet time Indian art Georges-Pierre Seurat Frankfurt School Homoeroticism Chinese art Frans Hals Arthur Schopenhauer Aesthetic Realism Titian Gustave Caillebotte Abstract art Computer animation Guy Davenport Hokusai Ethics Visual arts Romanticism Dutch Golden Age Berthe Morisot Taoism Culture of Egypt Existentialism Hentai Greco-Buddhist art Philosophy of perception Translation Performance art Copyright law of the United Kingdom Princeton University

advice on my drawing ok so the other day i started a color pencil using prismacolor berol soft lead high quality pencils drawing of a red telephone booth the booth is the focus of the drawing and the people walking past are very blurry you cant see any facial features i colored the people with colored pencil as well but now looking back i want to make everything outside the red telephone booth black and white there is no way i can erase the coloring in the people i considered painting over the people and doing everything else outside the telephone booth with paint black and white remember would this be all right also i have heard of using an exacto knife to scrape off the very top layer of the paper in order to get rid of a mistake is drawing paper too thin for this or is that just for paintings thank you ps this is drawing paper from a sketchbook its probably too thin you'll weaken the paper and wont be able to draw on it often times with the right eraser you can get the majority of stuff out but something cool you can do with the exacto knife carefully cut out the phone booth and paste it to another page and then draw the people it will give the drawing some texture and dimension and make the whole piece pop  Drawing Traditional animation Pencil Typewriter Casting Glass Pastel Lead Wood 2D computer graphics Textile manufacturing Telephone booth Surrealist techniques Piet Mondrian Francis Bacon (painter) Knife Pottery Drew Struzan Shroud of Turin Diamond Hey Jude Solar cell Rendering (computer graphics) Wassily Kandinsky Eraser Katana Paint Geologic time scale Rayleigh scattering Time Out of Mind Abstraction Toilet paper Chess terminology Superman Tag Dr. Seuss Pixel art Violin Tofu Photography Anaglyph image Babe Ruth The Ashlee Simpson Show Upholstery White Hair Bassoon Tattoo Paleoclimatology Glaze The Shining (film) Pulp Fiction United States dollar Diamond simulant Little Britain Frogman Modem Flag of the United States Sword making Mattress Color Wood carving Stereoscopy Laser engraving Microsoft Paint Billiards Super Mario 64 Bowie knife The Warriors Technicolor Piano Mario Hearing impairment Carl Barks Ice cream Woodworking Drill bit Telephone directory Yellow Grace Cossington Smith Fountain pen Satchel Paige Lithium Rice paper Gramophone record Mokume-gane Black (people) Dodge Charger Portrait miniature Babbitt metal Archery Crayola Scarification Light-emitting diode Blood on the Tracks Ammolite Paper RuneScape quests

dilemma which idea do i pick for a comic graphic novel for university i need a portfilio to show i can draw even though i want to do computer animation you still need to be able to draw because thats where all the planning is done but i want to demonstrate my abilities as an artist to show i can do more than just a picture and that i understand visual concepts as well so im putting together a comic graphic novel or the starts of really to show i understand these concepts but i keep hitting this brick wall of what to do i have tons of ideas but i cant figure out which one would be best or if you have suggestions yourself of an idea im open to it hopefully if finish something ill put in on the net to read on yahoo or myspace when its done but dont hold your breathe its going take a while rite the ideas a man troop caught up in world war a pair of assasins in a distopian future city trying to make a living a group of university students animated drawn diaries or any of your own suggestions will help as well more details no problem the man troop are complied by guys and girl the troop leader was an us army ranger until the us had sanction placed on them by the un and so had their forces over to nato of the guys one black chilled out kind of raver and one white slightly nerdy guy are drafted by the britsh army to work for nato as they have special talents as soldiers the girl who is also british joins willingly she was training to be a sniper but it got cut short due to demand set the are all sent to hong kong on request from the hong kong government from the chinese armed forces the second is of a guy who hjas turned to crime due to the murder of his family recently he not seeking revenge but is trying to relieve his hatred of all criminals the other is a girl who was going to become a doctor but was landed with a criminal record she started to make a living as a hacker but kind of becomes interested in this guy who is an assasin its set in the future around in a world of complete dominance by corperations and the criminal underworld where i dont know yet the last one is meant to be a bit of a sitcom but drawn instead between university students who leave in a shared apartment the characters are boys and girls guy is layed back and chilled out but very intelligent guy is shy and nervous particually around girls but is an animator the last guy is a dj that is a bit to loud and over confindent girl is also intelligent but is quite dull she doesnt want to do to much in one go girl is also shy and the shy guy fancies her and she fancies him but both are to sacre to ask the other out the last girl is intelligent but slow so a lot of the humour is derived from her not being all their even though she is smart if you want some great distopian future stuff i've always found that you don't need a whole lot of action a lot of the great graphic novels about that kind of stuff are actually more mystery thirllers i would stay away from guns and explosions myself what if your second and first ideas were somehow combined and it was about how completely screwed the future corporate governments are while they are waginging war on eachother i think if these soldiers were members of some kind of underground resistance rather than assasins it would add another layer of depth to their characters a good assasination plot against whoever theis head ceo president person is would be intersting i love totolitarian future government type stuff anything from orwell's to the manga for akira wuld be good refference material try to do something interesting viusally too maybe a limited color palate or lots of full spread images it's not just about the story but how it flows i'm sure if you're making a graphic novel you have an interest so i won't tell you how to do your art you may also want to pick up understanding comics by scott mccloud it's like a text book for comic book graphic novel artists it was amazingly helpful to me even after college classes  Manga Comics Ghost in the Shell Sin City Aerial (dance move) Hentai Sonic the Hedgehog Grant Morrison City Hunter Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus War Friends Computer animation Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Ultimate Spider-Man Star Wars Punisher Nerd The Catcher in the Rye M16 (rifle) Drill bit Digimon DC Comics Theory of conduct The Scout Association of Hong Kong Neil Gaiman Trigun United States Army KaBlam!

any good drawing websites to draw a realistic wolf thanks to those of you who actually help begin by printing out a really good clear picture of a wolf then grid it up with a pencil and ruler say boxes or something now draw the same grid on your drawing paper either same scale or enlarge it then turn your photo and paper upside down and recreate the drawing upside down this is good because you don't think ok i'm drawing an eye and then it comes out looking like a generic eye upside down you think more abstractly ok i'm drawing simple shapes and lines i promise this is the best way to get it to actually look like a wolf or whatever you're drawing when you're of the way done flip your drawing and photo right side up and make corrections oh also using the alphabet or numbers across the top and side of your grids can be helpful in finding the corresponding spot on your own drawing counting boxes is annoying  Sudoku Crossword Dominoes Aerial (dance move) Eye Traditional animation 3D projection Professional wrestling throws Polygon Wallpaper group Racetrack (game) Stereoscopy Photography Table tennis Mathematics Writing Mattress Polyomino British national grid reference system Punch card Ballpoint pen Glossary of partner dance terms Yu-Gi-Oh!

i need some artists out there to help me wiht this one this may sound very odd of a problem but here goes i love to draw mainly caricatures but when i draw them i hate the way they come out i guess i want them to look professional right away now how do i overcome this odd problem and continue on my journey to drawing caricatures any advice anyone has or anything that will make me enjoy my drawings ad keep them drawing a caricature is suposed to be fun for me its just frustrating this is not an odd problem grasshopper you have a picture in your head of what you want them to look like but they just arn't hitting the mark why nine times outa ten you're skills aren't up to what you want to put out this isn't a bust on you allow me to elaborate it's like drawing anything take the people you want to do even though you are exagerating the features you still have to be able to make the face look like a face start with the basics and try drawing it the way it is first it doesn't have to be super detailed but everything has to be there if you can't do this you can't caracterize it do studies of just eyes draw them realistic same with noses ears everything once you feel you have that down pretty well look at what you've done i don't mean just look but i mean really study what you have in front of you look at the curves of an ear the bridge of a nose study what you are doing i know you may be thinking i wanted to do characitures not portraits baby steps you have to walk before you can run doing things this way will give you understanding of what you want to draw later now think about ways to exagerate these things and do studies on them doing different versions of the same thing once you feel you're doing well try putting them all together get some pictures of people and give it a shot always keep in mind that you're looking for features that stand out these will be the things that will still make them resemble who the person is it's a lot of work but if this what you want to do it's worth the effort rome wasn't built in a day and niether will this i know you said they're supposed to be fun and with time they can be but just like anything else in life you have to work before you can have fun you just have to get your brain and hands on the same page before you know it you'll be making everyone look silly good luck  Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Diving Time Out of Mind Social rule Jon Secada Shaggy dog story Game show Norway national football team Craps The Ashlee Simpson Show Care Bears Skateboarding trick About a Boy Kodocha EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an W.

what course should i read to become a animator the course you need to be animator is different to what level you are at now but i would suggest that you apply for digital animation if you look at what the industry uses today you will see they use d max studio maya now sometimes they use these softwares and also others to animate but i mostly use studio max and maya they are used for many things such as modelling products animated them such as cars or anything you see on the shelf today as well the best way is to join a course that is spread into three to four years or a one year course that is concentrated and you will learn everything if it is the degree of three years to four years then you'll learn different ways to animate with different softwares and then the second year you can choose which area in animation you wish to choose and specialise i use d max studio for modelling and for games and for modelling and designing cars and animating them in other softwares you'll about plugins which are special effects i left some examples of courses and online community forum for d and d animators but here is more indepth information animators animators make drawings or models come to life on screen their work is used in animated short and full length films television cartoons adverts computer games websites and film special effects they specialise in one of four animation techniques d hand drawn or traditional d computer generated d computer generated known as cgi' stop frame stop motion or model animation there are many stages involved in producing an animation from generating ideas to building models and final editing each stage can involve several specific jobs development directors and producers create ideas plan the project and find funding pre production production designers create the look storyboard artists take the script or ideas and show the story in a visual way and layout artists draw how each shot will look production digital painters touch up colours animators and modellers follow the storyboard and use computer or stop frame animation to create movement and personality post production compositors join the different layers of animation backgrounds special effects characters and graphics editors produce the finished piece on large or long running productions several animators and assistants can work on one stage for several weeks months or even years animators working on smaller projects might cover several jobs see skillset s website for detailed information about animation job roles details in further information entry you do not need set qualifications to become an animator although most animators start by taking an animation or art related course at college or university to develop their skills before looking for work several colleges and universities offer foundation degrees btec hnds degrees and postgraduate courses in animation the most useful courses include practical skills and work placements check with colleges and universities about course content and entry requirements see skillset s website for details of industry endorsed animation courses you could also get into the industry with other relevant subjects like illustration graphic design computer programming model making or sculpture d design multimedia design you will often start as a studio runner then progress to junior roles like storyboard assistant digital painter or assistant animator you do not need any qualifications to be a runner although in practice many people who start at this level are graduates employers always want to see proof of your talent and creativity so you will need a show reel of your best animation work to show to companies and studios you could also show commitment to joining the industry by entering animation competitions and festivals and sending short animated films or ideas to broadcasters contact skillset careers for more advice about breaking into the animation industry training you will normally train on the job learning from more experienced animators you should keep up to date with developments in the animation industry throughout your career it will be useful to learn more software packages that are relevant to your job for example ds max flash action script motionbuilder lightwave d after effects many other packages are available and some companies also create software to meet their own needs your employer may organise some courses for you or you may be responsible for your own training and development you can take short courses in a wide range of animation software packages and techniques at several film schools universities and private training companies skillset and the british film institute jointly provide a database of media courses see skillset s website for this and for information about how to fund your training if you are a freelance animator annual income starting salaries for animators are around a year experienced and skilled animators usually earn around to a year you may also earn a bonus at the end of a project particularly in the computer games industry freelance animators are usually paid a fee for each contract or project you could negotiate fees based on the type of production and your experience and track record or you may be paid according to broadcasting entertainment cinematograph and theatre union bectu guidelines hours

how do you make prints of your artwork i am an artist that does mostly traditional artwork as well as some digital work i am wondering how the art print system works how do i get my work scanned or photographed or such and where to take it to get it printed what types of paper to use or processes like glicee matte etc and how much it usually costs thank you in advance i know that this is a tough question to answer magpookie and dey are right a there is no general answer to your question and b you can try some stuff out on the internet but you need your artwork in digital form first i'd recommend going to one or more copy print shops directly there are a lot of them in cities here so i suppose it will be the same in your country and i find that sometimes even a small workshop can deliver amazing results if you make an appointment they will show you what they can do and you can feel the paper important and see what the print would look like on their screen if you go to more than one you can compare prices get a variety of suggestions sorry but some things just can't be done on a platform like this you need to go and see real people that's how i met my friend in a print shop by the way nice side effect good night anna  Photography Traditional animation Digital photography Art Stereoscopy Digital art Enterprise content management Color printing Theory of conduct Konica Minolta Sampling (music) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Demoscene IBM PC compatible Prostate cancer Modem Hyperinflation Graphics Extreme Programming Geographic information system Photocopying United States Postal Service Avenue Q Ebook Portable Document Format UK Singles Chart Sega Saturn Copy protection Mid-levels Video game music Widescreen Game programmer Open access Printmaking Direct marketing Xerox Microeconomics The Emancipation of Mimi DeviantART Dot matrix printer Manga Book Printing press A Course In Miracles Computer Blood on the Tracks Inflation Copyright Little Britain Magic: The Gathering Newspaper Digital television Roswell UFO incident System/36 Nintendo GameCube The Apprentice 2 Digimon RISC Password Slide rule Killian documents CPU cache Electronic voting Cinerama Drew Struzan Open source culture Screen-printing Expert system PRS Guitars Milton H.

how do i shade like a pro i know that varying the pressure is important but what about the angle and the way i hold the pencil direction of shading length of pencil strokes density of lines for some reason i can't get my lines to blend together if your lines don't blend you either a are holding the pencil at the wrong angle or b varying your pressure too quickly ive never found direction very important it has always worked better for me if i used the side of the lead rather than the point to shade try this excercise get a piec of paper and turn it so its wider than it is long start shading at the far end so you're creating a strip of color about an inch or so thick stay at the same pressure for the first inches across the paper at that point start lightening your pressure but very slowly see if you can make it to the end of the sheet and still have a consistently brightening strip of color i had to do this hundreds of times in school it really made me better  Drawing Traditional animation Billiards Drill bit Terminal ballistics Textile manufacturing Pencil Drag racing Computer representation of surfaces Knife Wood Stairway Volleyball Saw Table tennis Ballpoint pen Internal ballistics Plasma display Laser engraving Fluorescent lamp Pinhole camera Punch card Softball Mattress Rigging Cartridge (firearms) Gramophone record Welding Textile manufacturing terminology Snooker Rail terminology Bicycle frame Stereoscopy View camera Bong Apollo Command/Service Module Ray tracing Canoe Bookbinding Fourth dimension Rayleigh scattering Racetrack (game) Headlight Anemometer Trigonometric function Strap-on dildo Dog agility Paper size Springfield 1903 rifle Cinematography Dominoes Leather Car handling Angle Temporal bone Equine conformation Drew Struzan Slide rule Laws of cricket Shade Pachypodium key to species Pachypodium ambongense Atari 8-bit family Euclidean plane isometry Pastel Fountain pen Snowboard Fast bowling Sundial Color theory Glacier Sacrum Stage lighting Breaststroke Audio tape length and thickness Punt (boat) Phong shading Lathe Marching band Thermal power station Horse Chess strategy and tactics Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Pressure Fire fighting Sternum M__bius strip Paper Helicopter Violin Archery Amateur telescope making Badminton Mitsubishi 3000GT Surrealist techniques Tobacco Wassily Kandinsky Parallax Etching

how do i draw a storm i want to draw one with clouds and lightning and rain thanks in advance also i want to know how to draw a snowstorm thanks what's a storm clouds are heavy and dark so make some clouds shade your paper with random shades making some semblance of storm clouds no sharp edges should be present the storm should get darker near the horizon now use a typewriter eraser or kneadable eraser to pull some short quick highlights out that will turn into the precipitation use the pencil to edge the highlights to pull them out carry on from there depending on the type of storm you want for example lightning should be carefully pulled out as stark white with a thin eraser some glow should be present try using a tortillion to pull the background away from the bolt a snowstorm is different basically you're shading with white the highlights become the fog instead of shading  Drawing Lightning Supercell Cloud Thunderstorm Rain Typewriter Winter storm Disaster Lightning rod Mercury Atlas 6 Climate of Salt Lake City Natural disaster Cumulonimbus cloud Fog Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 RuneScape skills Spark plug Weather satellite Screw Legion of Super-Heroes Imperial stormtrooper Force powers Headlight Weather lore Drill bit Traditional animation Radar Water vapor Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Lightning safety Internal ballistics Severe weather terminology (United States) Robot Master Gameplay of StarCraft USS Tunny (SS-282) Solar power Weather forecasting Radio controlled airplane Combat Mission (computer game series) Pottery Battle of the Bulge Heavy metal music Guitar Sacrifice (computer game) Knife Moby-Dick Moon 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Swimming Comet West Indian cricket team Cherubimon M16 (rifle) Cat coat genetics Space elevator Yu-Gi-Oh!

is there an alternative to using technical pens that allows detail drawing and permanence i've been using my tech pens recently to add details to my watercolor paintings i love the effect but its hard to keep the tech pens clean is there some alternative that professionals use that allows easy or no clean up that will last without fading you can use markers such as pigma micron copic multiliner and others that are pigment based not dye based so they will not fade and are waterproof when dry they come in multiple line widths just like tech pens and give consistent lines without ever blobbing or skipping they never clog and there's no clean up most are disposable but copic makes one that's refillable and takes replacement nibs awesome with watercolour i retired my tech pens years ago note sharpies are dye based and will fade over time  Inkjet printer Ballpoint pen Paint Watercolor painting Fountain pen Drawing Textile manufacturing Tattoo Sharpie (marker) Pen and ink Dip pen Pastel CPU cache Oscilloscope Clothing Cochineal Genericized trademark Crimson Upholstery Dry cleaning EIA-708 Pen Traditional animation Strap-on dildo Knife Whois Brooklyn Technical High School Monopoly (game) Sandpaper Acrylic paint Tag Hair coloring Color theory Trombone Paintball Citadels (game) Japanese toilet Dishwasher Tire Photography Preferred number Painting Pigment Casting Items in the Metroid series Scientology beliefs and practices Laws of cricket Technology Francis Bacon (painter) Staining (biology) Georges-Pierre Seurat Chromium Plastic Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Gramophone record Home repair Chopsticks Beatmania IIDX Murdock-Portal Elementary School Floppy disk Printmaking Traffic sign Mercury (element) Paper Cathode ray tube Tempera Pencil Violin Chicago White Sox Brush Idaho Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets Chrono Trigger Bass guitar Diaper The Amazing Race Hip hop collaborations J.

what should i draw i want to draw something but i cant think of anything any suggestions would be ok even random ones like saying a plate with a fork on it or something also i would like some ideas of what to make collages of but be specific not just saying themes like food or colors but actual ideas like hot dog or blue thanks the weather can be an interesting platform take a storm as an example you would need different blues greys and whites to form the background you could feature various anomalies like lightning rain and cloud perhaps you could add coloured umbrellas and other relevant items raincoats boots e t c the same can be done for all types of weather you could even represent the seasons in the same way i hope this may inspire some ideas good luck and take care c j  Lightning Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Color Rain Resident Evil (video game) Cloud Sgt.

what is the standard collage size thanks for the answers so far guys like butterfliez said i think a collage could be any size you'd like if ti's going into an album the standard picture size is x but i guess if you make a collage and take a picture of it it could be any size the standard printer paper is x i read up some on collages for you and found that a collage is a picture or design created by adhering such basically flat elements as newspaper wallpaper printed text and illustrations photographs cloth string etc to a flat surface when the result becomes three dimensional and might also be called a relief sculpture construction assemblage most of the elements adhered in producing most collages are found materials good luck and happy creating peace  Collage Surrealist techniques BASIC programming language Graphics Photography Computer printer Drawing Bookbinding Perspective (graphical) Paper size Digital art Common Unix Printing System Lisp programming language Crossword View camera PostScript Typewriter Photographic film Anamorphic widescreen Stereoscopy Paper Database Manifold Inkjet printer Autostereogram Guy Davenport Tom Phillips (artist) Handicraft Goatse.cx Drill bit Pixel Book Enlarger Crass Slide rule Scheme programming language Surface-mount technology Adrian Frutiger Digital photography Desk Loudspeaker Portable Document Format Compact disc C programming language Surrealism Brett Whiteley Martin Sharp Movie projector Printed circuit board Photographic paper The Hobbit Computer animation Casting Point groups in three dimensions Typeface Dot matrix printer Printmaking M.C.

what do you think about this website in order to give my own website a better design i'm comparing some random websites and would like to know what people think about some webdesigns please take a look at this website http www ciao surveys international com and describe what you like or dislike about this design not about the company so please focus on color look feel graphics functionality etc a few random thoughts the lighter red that you use as non rollover buttons is a bit dull compared to all the bright colors that you use the orange which should be a highlight color really gets lost in the dark red that you use maybe use a darker color for contrast the body text could be a smidge bigger as a base size it would probably be hard to read for people with vision problems i'm not a huge fan of that orange bar to the right side of the page it sometimes runs into the middle section and it sometimes doesn't and it looks ackward i feel like there should be some separation between the middle column and the right one  Atari 8-bit family Color Color theory Human skin color Color blindness Nintendo 64 Autostereogram Mouse (computing) Pop'n Music CPU cache Color Graphics Adapter Beatmania IIDX Yu-Gi-Oh!

i'm an artist but have a problem motivating myself to work on my art work any suggestions read a lot of books and do a lot of research on your interests the more you learn about the world the more inspired you will become take every opportunity to travel or work with others go to a lot of museums art natural history any study other artists when i am feeling lost or unmotivated i always keep going i force myself to keep working sketch a lot and always keep a sketch pad with you to record ideas its okay to make bad drawings or pointless drawings because sometimes it takes those seemingly pointless or bad drawings to get a great idea experiment with different materials drawing mixed media sculpture etc when i work with new and different materials new ideas arise and new inspiration and motivation arises a true artist is one that is educated and in tune with the world an artist with knowledge does not have trouble motivating themselves the most important point with motivating yourself to do your artwork is to make art work that is important to you don't worry about pleasing or making art for other people the viewers of your art will appreciate the personal connection the pieces have with the artist think about what social personal or other passions you have what are you passionate about use that passion to make your work think about what you want to tell the world and base your artwork around that important note  Art David Hume Henry Moore Drawing Philosophy of language Academic art Motivation Philosophy of mathematics Modernism Logic Theory of conduct Education Outsider Art Brett Whiteley Current teachings of Prem Rawat M.C.

why why are animes mostly asian but the characters never look asian you know what's interesting about that style asians see anime characters as asian and europeans see them as european anime manga is a style that has over years of hard development initially anime and manga characters were all drawn with distinctly asian features straight black hair narrow eyes etc over time drawing them with consciously over sized eyes was the preferred style of drawing them because eyes are an incredibly important highlight of a person's emotions so oversizing them is a good way to illustrate a person's emotions exactly as you want too outlandish hair styles comes from manga artists becoming bored of drawing and inking nothing but straight black hair so they began to experiment with both color and style and while you can certainly say that the modern product is not asian having outlandishly styled and exotically colored hair is not innately euro american neither however some attributes still remain distinctly asian upon closer inspection manga and anime heros tend to be tall slender and have an angled chin compare that to american heros like superman he has broad shorters thin waist and has a chin that looks like he chews on iron nuggets in anime usually only brutish or buffoon type characters have those sort of features where as in american style devious villians are the ones who are thin and angular but the fact that you see them as anglo and asians see them as asians is in fact a testament to the amount of refinement that genre has gone through heros are people we are supposed to relate to otherwise superhero stories would be about as interesting as watching two boll weevils fight over a mate  Anime Superhero Manga Black (people) Drawing Hair Physical attractiveness American comic book White (people) Sesshomaru Greys Comics Garfield Wood Strap-on dildo Table saw Gundam Wassily Kandinsky Trigun Cat Hyuga Hinata Equine conformation Men in Black Quotation mark Traditional animation Leaf Human Sexual orientation Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Eyepiece Tenchi Muyo!

is it a sin to get a tattoo and how painful is it really i'm planning to get it but if it is a sin then i wont it is not a sin who said it was a sin were you talking to your parents grandparents religious leader some people argue that your body is really not your body but that it actually belongs to god so you should not abuse it or desecrate it it should be somewhere on the bible but i don't know where if we think like that then we could not do over half the things we do daily also come on really if you hear this just tell them that god also gave us free will and that many tribes people have had tattoos as a form of decoration or rite of passage so why should it be a sin many tattoos i have seen glorify god various saints and the virgin mary tattoos can be a beautiful way to express yourself and to allow an artist to use you as a canvas i love the movie the pillow book even though it was not about tattoos it was about using the body as a text as a canvas the movie was also about other things get the tattoo if you really want to get one things to consider when getting one are which design do i choose what if i can't stand the pain will i walk out with a half done tattoo that could be funny how am i going to look with this tattoo how is it going to look when i wear a particular piece of clothing how is it going to look when i am years old i don't think it's cool to have your grandkid ask to see your tattoo and then say oh gross it's all wrinkly how is it going to look if i gain lose weight how is going to look if i get pregnant belly area tattoos what if i am in a conservative job will it have consequences i have a friend who has to wear clothes that cover her pretty good at work because otherwise her tattoos show in her work she is not allowed to have tattoos or piercings show she works in the tropics and cannot wear short sleeves that are too short because her tattoos show and always complains of the heat i have a friend who is married to a very conservative man and even though her tattoos are in non visible areas her husband gives her grief about them constantly just be strong enough to stand up to him if it happens also if he met you with them he fell in love with you and you already had them he should not be complaining i am sure there are many other things to consider when deciding whether to get one or not but whether it is a sin or not is definitely not one of them  Tattoo Homosexuality and Christianity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Original sin Eastern Orthodox Church Mortification of the flesh Roman Catholic Church Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ten Commandments Comanche Book of Isaiah Resurrection of Jesus Mary, the mother of Jesus Book of Mormon A Course In Miracles Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist EastEnders God Church of Christ, Scientist Predestination Angelina Jolie Sabbath Paul of Tarsus Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Social rule Religious pluralism Summa Theologiae John the Baptist Sola fide Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Calvinism John Wesley Good Charlotte Articles of Religion (Methodist) Paradise Lost Sento Justification (theology) Jennifer Lopez Opus Dei Angel Nine Inch Nails Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Rastafari movement Theodicy Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Scarification The Death Gate Cycle Sin City Idolatry 613 mitzvot Our Friends in the North Virgin Mary in Islam Jackass: The Movie Humphrey Bogart Tridentine Mass Christian view of marriage The Amber Spyglass Book of Job Merit Death (personification) Church of Christ Vanilla Ninja Dragon Booster Religious Society of Friends Baptism Theory of conduct Salvation Catechism Catholicism Body piercing Christian views of women John Wycliffe Simone Weil Hazing Origin belief Knots Landing Days of our Lives 2004 Democratic National Convention Book of Joshua Ouroboros Memento (film) John Lennon Jewish principles of faith Tibetan people Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Brave New World Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends Charmed Christian views of Jesus Religion and sexuality

what should i draw i like to draw and i need a subject preferrebly not a person because i'm not so good at people just an object and i do draw sunsets and paint them all the time i guess i mean something symbolic like keys and hearts i don't know but all suggestions are welcome and also i am good at people it's just the hands i can't get and i practice all the time i just can't get the hands here's an idea get black paper and white chalk and draw a still object backwards instead of drawing shadows draw its highlights it's fun art doesn't have to be constricted it's not a boxed skill even if you can't draw hands you can draw a person and for his her hands draw tree branches or something just do what you feel  Drawing Art Tag Milton H.
