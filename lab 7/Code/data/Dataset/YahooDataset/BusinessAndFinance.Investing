why does the stock market keep crashing the stock market won't stop going up and then down it's like a stupid roller coaster what's happening there has been no crash the financial sector has suffered recently due to the inappropriate lending practices over the last couple years people getting mortgages for houses they can't afford interest only loans and such as the interest rates have risen these people have begun defaulting on loans and this has causes the companies holding the loans to suffer losses some of these have been pushed back to the originators and packagers and now all the financials are afraid to hold or originate mortgages due to the increased scrutiny and apparent risk anyway this behavior has led to a credit squeeze in which there is too little money available for loans the market ups and downs have been only moderate when one considers the dow has hit the level age movement is quite reasonable we have merely hit a period of high volatility due to this credit squeeze and some conflicting economic data if you can't sleep because of worry over what is going to happen next you are better off moving your assets to bonds treasuries money markets cd's etc you can come back into the market in a month or two once the volatility has subsided you can watch the vix to see when things calm down  Debt Deflation (economics) Mortgage Asian financial crisis Finance Bank Short selling Supply-side economics Derivative (finance) Mortgage-backed security Economy of Russia Insurance Money supply Monetary policy Economy of Pakistan Federal National Mortgage Association Bretton Woods system Stock Gold standard Inflation Predatory lending PE ratio Interest rate Real estate bubble Interest Student loan History of the United States (1918-1945) Money Security (finance) Toronto-Dominion Bank Credit card Technical analysis Government National Mortgage Association Mergers and acquisitions Financial markets Life insurance Usury Modern portfolio theory Capitalism Central bank Wall Street Crash of 1929 Microcredit U.S. public debt Financial services Annuity Keynesian economics Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Islamic banking Yield curve United Kingdom corporation tax Collateralized debt obligation Corporate finance Futures contract Economy of the United States Fractional-reserve banking Economy of India 401(k) Privatization Great Depression Investment bank Free trade Microeconomics Fiat money Economy of Iceland Bank of America Volatility Subsidy Health insurance Personal finance Credit derivative Wells Fargo Cost of capital Debt levels and flows Bank fraud Eugene Fama Corporation Treasury security NASDAQ Capital asset pricing model Urinary incontinence British property bubble Institutional fund management FairTax Social Security debate (United States) Economy of Haiti Savings and loan association

why did the feds put billions of dollars in the stock market yesterday this is called monetary policy it is the control of cash or liquidity that is available in the economy they didn't put it in the stock market what they did was they bought government securities from the financial markets this meant they had to pay for the securities which means there is more cash in the economy they do the same thing by lowering the interest rates the lower the rates the more attractive it is for people to borrow money and hence the more cash liquidity is available in the economy it's very complicated but i've tried to simplify it hope it helped  Money supply Monetary policy Inflation Security (finance) Asian financial crisis Bond Money Central bank Deflation (economics) Hyperinflation Federal Reserve Keynesian economics Bank Economy of Russia Insurance Warren Buffett Euro Capital accumulation Argentine Currency Board Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Economy of the United States Tax Capitalism Microeconomics Gold standard Bretton Woods system Temasek Holdings Great Depression Reaganomics Interest Arbitrage Financial markets Finance Yield curve Dot-com Debt Margin (finance) Arthur Laffer Economy of Pakistan Mergers and acquisitions Privatization Derivative (finance) Supply-side economics Pound sterling Annuity Wal-Mart Government debt Capital asset pricing model FairTax Economy of India Enron Corporation Stock Mortgage Mortgage-backed security Short selling Gross domestic product Foreign exchange market Dividend Fixed income Say's law Monetarism Economy of Sri Lanka Mutual fund Rational pricing Stock market Corporate finance Citigroup Political economy Economics Predatory lending U.S. public debt PE ratio Economy of Nigeria History of post-Soviet Russia Deficit spending Modern portfolio theory Free trade Economy of Romania Flat tax Economy of Chile History of the United States (1918-1945) Income trust Supply and demand Economy of Greece Economy of Cuba Credit card Surplus value Economy of South Africa Social Security debate (United States) New Deal Black-Scholes Social Security (United States) Investment bank Economy of Hungary Economy of Bolivia

in stocks is there eventually a breaking point no matter how good you are in how much you can make read de okay here is my question the more money you invest the longer and harder it is too sell the stock right so eventually say you have made million dollars it would be hard to sell thta much equity quickly right how much do you think someone can make and are there any billionaires who have money from just stock large blocks of stock are regularly traded sometimes you break it up into smaller parcels and sell it over hours or days or weeks depending on how much you have to get rid of and what you are willing to signal to the market some of the largest shares trade dollars a day most don't you have to let your position go into the market in a way that wont cause the price you get to go down so you are correct in saying it might be difficult to liquidate such a position in a day but if by quickly you mean a couple of weeks and by company you mean something liquid like microsoft or walmart yes you can liquidate that the other side of that is if you have that much stock in one company you probably have to report your planned sales to the sec everyone will eventually know it's coming and can adjust prices and volume accordingly to accomodate the trasaction that they have fair warning about  Wal-Mart Mutual fund Short selling Supply-side economics Microsoft Bond Hedge fund Investment bank Deflation (economics) Security (finance) Derivative (finance) Margin (finance) Stock Dot-com Temasek Holdings Citigroup Mergers and acquisitions PE ratio Day trading NASDAQ Berkshire Hathaway Tesco Arbitrage Hyperinflation Stock market index Monetary policy Sears Holdings Corporation Warren Buffett Economy of Russia Insider trading Asian financial crisis Foreign exchange market Closed-end fund American International Group Harken Energy Scandal Employee stock option Microeconomics Technical analysis ITunes Music Store Dow Jones Industrial Average Economy of Romania Donald Trump Bretton Woods system Economy of Nigeria Google Lehman Brothers Economy of Pakistan Finance Supply and demand United Kingdom corporation tax Great Depression Mad Money Economy of India Gold as an investment Mutual-fund scandal (2003) Video game crash of 1983 The Apprentice 2 Income trust Market capitalization Hard disk Bank Timeline of the Enron scandal Market liquidity Goldman Sachs Privatization Nortel Networks Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Taxation in the United States Option Wall Street Crash of 1929 Money Financial services Annuity Initial public offering United States dollar Financial markets Tax J Sainsbury Law of value Wall Street Corporation Stock exchange Long-Term Capital Management Monopoly Natural monopoly Anchor Morgan Stanley Equity investment FairTax

camarilla equation does anyone have adverse comments about using the camarilla equation on the djia index end of day positions thank you the caramilla equation was developed for use in day trading but i see no reason why it couldn't be used for end of day positions also the camarilla equation is a popular secret day trading equation its discovery is commonly attributed to day trader nick scott the principle behind the camarilla equation is the idea that market trends tend over time to revert to a mean the camarilla equation takes four variables from the previous trading day the market opening market closing high and low based on these variables the equation generates eight price levels the lowest four are support levels labeled from l to l the highest four are resistance levels labeled from h to h these levels represent points at which a reverse toward the mean will occur on a given trading day levels l and h are the most important levels generated by the equation at level l the market is strongly supported suggesting a reverse toward higher prices at level h the market has a strong resistance suggesting a reverse toward lower prices levels l and h are breakout levels meaning that if market prices exceed these levels the equation asserts that this breakout trend will continue for some time due to its secret nature there are many different versions of the camarilla equation some more complicated and accurate than others the validity of the camarilla equation is debated and research on its predictive ability is currently being done by trader steve waller the name comes from the spanish word camarilla meaning a group of secret advisors often involved in intrigues  Technical analysis Inflation Economics Supply and demand Capitalism Microeconomics Free trade Causality Intelligence quotient Black hole Minimum wage Price equation Yield curve Monetary policy General relativity Liberal Democrats (UK) Keynesian economics Gravity Law of value Explosive material Supply-side economics Mutual fund Surplus value Ozone depletion Luminiferous aether Sea level rise Entropy Capital accumulation Global climate model Quantum mechanics Prices of production Kyoto Protocol Obesity Hypoglycemia Dow Jones Industrial Average Day trading Economy of Russia Operational amplifier Solar variation Tide Capital asset pricing model Human Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Special relativity Gross domestic product Ozone hole Economy of Africa Action potential Voter turnout Many-worlds interpretation Futures contract Pound sterling Doomsday argument Economic inequality Social Security debate (United States) Second language acquisition Strategic management Labor theory of value Big Bang Probability ELO rating system Derivative (finance) Democracy Diamond American individualist anarchism Antiretroviral drug Free market Macroevolution Mathematics of general relativity Dirac equation Experiment Political economy Physics Fermi paradox Central processing unit Future energy development FairTax Thermodynamics Shader Androgen insensitivity syndrome Temperature Ordinary differential equation Closing milestones of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Fair trade 2005 Atlantic hurricane season SAT Grade (education) Partial differential equation Short selling Speed of light

why is it bad when people sell their stocks i don't quite understand the market dropping like it is i guess my question is why are people freaking out about sub prime mortgages and why would they sell shares because of it because of the insecurity of sub prime mortgages and the fact that a percentage of these will end as re posessions some companies holding these mortgages could find themselves with liquidity problems investors in these companies will get nervous and want to get their money out before the company collapses these companies then sell their shares in other companies to get the money to pay out their own withdrawing shareholders if a lot of shares in a company are sold these shares drop on their price this tends to make shareholders in other companies nervous and they sell before the price drops too much you then can get a snowball effect but usually the market stablises itself after a short while because most investers are there for the long term and accept the minor rises and falls  Bond Stock market Deflation (economics) Mortgage Asian financial crisis Stock PE ratio Enron Corporation Short selling Financial markets Warren Buffett Great Depression Dot-com Derivative (finance) Institutional fund management Bank Closed-end fund Mergers and acquisitions Dividend Corporate governance Corporate finance Debt Temasek Holdings Corporation Insurance Keynesian economics Citigroup Capitalism Privatization Employee stock option Arbitrage One.Tel Wall Street Crash of 1929 Yield curve Margin (finance) Economy of Russia Hedge fund Bretton Woods system Berkshire Hathaway Hyperinflation Market capitalization Mikhail Khodorkovsky Exchange-traded fund Finance United Kingdom corporation tax Housing cooperative Intellectual property The South Sea Company Capital accumulation Sears Holdings Corporation Monopoly (game) Mortgage-backed security American International Group Microeconomics Taxation in the United States __lectricit__ de France Government National Mortgage Association Publishing Islamic banking Annuity Gold as an investment Supply and demand Investment bank Stock market index Microsoft Mad Money Monetary policy Labor theory of value Say's law Predatory lending Long-Term Capital Management Technical analysis Gold standard Life insurance Health insurance Financial services Stock split Inflation Monopoly Interest Option Modern portfolio theory Video game crash of 1983 Money supply Speculation Corporate raid Monetarism Efficient market hypothesis Income trust Dow Jones Industrial Average Famine

do i need a stock broker to invest in shares or can i do it my self any suggestions you can pick the stocks to purchase yourself without the advice of a stock broker but in general you will need an account with a stock brokerage firm to conveniently pruchase shares of common stock or mutual funds some companies offer direct share purchase programs but this limits your choices also if you use an online brokerage firm you get the benefits of their analysis and charts but don't have to deal with pushy brokers trying to sell you their hot picks sometimes motivated by commissions they receive for selling i would recommend an online broker like scottrade etrade or tdwaterhouse fidelity has higher minums and fees i use scottrade only flat fee per transaction buy or sell no inactivity fees no minimum account balance and great website with all the tools charts and info for any level trader good luck investing remeber money at work is better than man or woman at work  Mutual fund Stock broker Insurance Short selling Mergers and acquisitions Stock Day trading Citigroup Investment bank Hedge fund Eliot Spitzer Financial services Stock market ETrading Warren Buffett Bank Finance Annuity Foreign exchange market Internet fraud Corporate governance Social Security debate (United States) Real estate broker Tesco Enron Corporation Corporate finance Financial analyst Business-to-consumer electronic commerce Life insurance Institutional fund management Free trade Exchange-traded fund Stock exchange Security (finance) Venture capital Corporation Investment advisor MMORPG Variable universal life insurance Mutual-fund scandal (2003) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act PE ratio Monetary policy Economics Gold as an investment Gross domestic product Capitalism Wal-Mart Price discrimination American International Group 401(k) Auction New Deal Temasek Holdings Trade Option Morgan Stanley Technical analysis Neopets Margin (finance) Mortgage Bond Ethical consumerism Economy of Russia Privatization Equity investment Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Capital accumulation Primerica Financial Services Supply and demand Advance fee fraud Deflation (economics) Bank fraud American Express Financial markets Insider trading Ameritrade Tax Great Depression Harken Energy Scandal Cable television Lehman Brothers Electronic commerce Password Derivative (finance) Islamic banking Wall Street Crash of 1929 Mad Money

is it better to buy a home before an investment property or vise versa i was thinking of buying an investment property to rent out which would look better for applying for the second does it matter there would be a loan on both you need to talk to your lender each one will view your situation differently a lot will depend on the equity you can show in either property whether it's by making a large down payment or the market in that area is rising quickly if you have the investment property and can show steady income from it it may help you qualify for your own home loan remember tho' the income from the property will be taxable so buying it for a month taxes ins principle and renting it for is not a pure profit but some lenders may balk if they believe you will be over extended and can't show long term tenents the market is presently getting a little more expensive to get into you may want to get your place first see what tax benefits you will have and then determine what sort of investment risk you can handle you need reserves to cover periods when the investment property is sitting empty unless you are thinking of buying bare land for selling in the distant future that's another scenario again talk to the mortgage lender that pre qualifies you before you go shopping  Insurance Mortgage Life insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Bond Mutual fund Debt Predatory lending Microeconomics Leasing Bank Real estate bubble Government debt Intellectual property Financial markets Annuity Capitalism 401(k) Economy of India Derivative (finance) Economic rent FairTax Municipal bond Flat tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Interest Inflation Monetary policy Real estate Gross domestic product Variable universal life insurance Short selling Security (finance) Personal finance Subsidy Islamic banking Real estate broker Corporate finance Capital accumulation Warren Buffett Anarchism and capitalism Productive and unproductive labour Profit Federal National Mortgage Association Corporation Dividend Trust (Law) USA Free trade Citigroup Mergers and acquisitions Privatization Money Hedge fund Property tax Mobile home Labor theory of value Rational pricing Asset Supply and demand Economy of the United States Temasek Holdings Progressive tax Allodial title Real estate developer Donald Trump Economy of Russia Economy of Pakistan Income tax Supply-side economics Income trust Property (ownership right) Repurchase agreement Primerica Financial Services Stock market Estoppel Title insurance Financial services Bretton Woods system Nuclear power Yield curve Urban sprawl Income statement Futures contract Copyright Mortgage-backed security Interest rate Venture capital Social Security debate (United States)

do i have to use the services of a broker to trade or buy funds why can't i just buy directly from the company first of all i don't really understand how do you define fund are you talking about mutual fund or a common stock of a company if you are talking about you want to buy shares directly from a company rather than a stockbroker than the answer is yes you may purchase companies's stock through stock transfer agent what is stock transfer agent basically companies that have publicly traded securities typically use transfer agents to keep track of the individuals and entities that own their stocks and bonds how can i find a stock transfer agent for the company i want to invest usually you can find a stock transfer agent under the company's website and it is usually under the investor relations section or contact us section why should i buy stocks from stock transfer agent rather than stock broker the beauty of buy a stock from stock transfer agent is you can invest as little as with a very little fee for example if you want to invest in jpmorgan chase but you don't have a couple of thousand dollars yet an initial cash investment can be as little as with a small fee to own a company stock another feature is you can reinvest the dividends to buy more shares free of charge usually also you can invest additional shares as little as annually at last you can buy and sell your shares freely through stock transfer agent or transfer your shares to any brokerage firm than sell it  Stock Mutual fund Stock broker Citigroup Short selling Insurance Warren Buffett Mergers and acquisitions Investment bank Stock market Hedge fund Financial services Dividend Exchange-traded fund Day trading PE ratio Security (finance) Financial markets Corporation Finance Real estate broker NASDAQ Annuity Income trust Stock exchange Microeconomics Corporate finance Closed-end fund Temasek Holdings Foreign exchange market Enron Corporation Taxation in the United States Margin (finance) Gold as an investment Individual Savings Account Bank Eliot Spitzer Stock market index United Kingdom corporation tax American International Group Capital accumulation Mutual-fund scandal (2003) Mortgage Morgan Stanley Institutional fund management SCO-Linux controversies Sears Holdings Corporation Dot-com Microsoft ETrading Surplus value Advance fee fraud Berkshire Hathaway Financial analyst Venture capital Arbitrage American Express Debt Lloyd's of London Wall Street Crash of 1929 Monetary policy Variable universal life insurance Harken Energy Scandal Wells Fargo Coalition Provisional Authority Conglomerate (company) Primerica Financial Services Outsourcing The South Sea Company Tesco 401(k) Publicly funded medicine Insider trading Employee stock option Option Internet fraud Donald Trump Corporate governance Income statement Ameritrade Investment advisor Cost of capital Free market Bank of America Amazon.com Wal-Mart Best Buy Michael Milken Tax Life insurance Short (finance) Mad Money Federal Reserve JPMorgan Chase & Co.

what are the most imporant things to look at in financial statements there are so many different ratios and trends you can look at in financial statements plus a lot of these seem to require assumptions about things like interest rates that are just impossible to know if you were comparing several stocks in a like gaming what fundamental factors would lead you to one stock over another other than the balance sheet and income statement i would look at the p e ratio a p e ratio being high or low doesn't say anything unless you compare it with other companies in the same industry say microsoft had a pe ratio of and apple had a pe ratio of on that alone you would say that the price to earnings ratio of is greater than microsoft since they are primarily in the same market and investors are expecting 'higher returns' with apple than microsoft a good sign to buy the stock  PE ratio Microeconomics Technical analysis Mutual fund Insurance Capital accumulation Arbitrage Valuation (finance) Bond Modern portfolio theory Capitalism Eugene Fama Stock market Debt Capital asset pricing model Asian financial crisis Social Security debate (United States) Inflation Microsoft Mergers and acquisitions Economics Supply and demand Free trade Surplus value Cost of capital Annuity Stock Gross domestic product Law of value Hedge fund Citigroup Collateralized debt obligation Financial analyst Short selling Corporate finance Gold standard Investment bank Finance Keynesian economics Nuclear fusion Berkshire Hathaway Gasoline Airline Black-Scholes Efficient market hypothesis Real estate bubble Income statement The South Sea Company Price discrimination Labor theory of value Equity investment Economy of India Economy of Venezuela Apple Computer Tax Money supply Rational pricing Intellectual property Hydrogen economy Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Federal National Mortgage Association __lectricit__ de France Deflation (economics) Monetary policy Economy of the Philippines Gold as an investment Dividend E85 Security (finance) Life insurance U.S. generally accepted accounting principles Economy of the United States Depreciation Income Economy of Nigeria Derivative (finance) Euro Mortgage Political economy 401(k) Economy of Romania Productive and unproductive labour Option Balassa-Samuelson effect Capital controversy Exogenous growth model Supply-side economics Day trading Fixed income MP3 Income trust Ford Motor Company Canadian and American economies compared Management information system Bretton Woods system

market correction called it first my predictiion calls for the stock market to make a fairly abrupt correction my prediction is that during the time frame of now to approximately the end of the markets will slide continually to a corrective point for the dow of between cant happen the dow fell from wherel it is about now in to waaaaaaay below more like and even lower it dropped that much in two years and then started a comeback starting in the market and the dow has had a good year so far even though we have seen time periods of sharp declines it is possible for a correction of to happen at anytime due to reaction to news events earnings inflation etc the fundamentals of the market are much stronger than that of the market it should be noted that the dow started dropping well before the nasdaq crashed back then the bottom line is that things are different now while isolated incidents of problems happen the amount of irrational exhuberance is substantially less than in the only way that your prediction comes true is if their is a world financial crisis or a major act of terroism occurs  Stock market downturn of 2002 October 27, 1997 mini-crash Asian financial crisis Technical analysis Deflation (economics) Black Monday (1987) Mass Short selling Bond Inflation Capitalism CNBC Monetarism Early 2000s recession September 11, 2001 attacks Dot-com Insurance Year 2000 problem Hyperinflation Dow Jones & Company Economic history of the United States NASDAQ Gold standard PE ratio Keynesian economics Annuity Anchor Arthur Laffer Dow Theory Supply-side economics Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Day trading Hubbert peak theory Stock market index Phase (matter) Capital accumulation Efficient market hypothesis Puberty Economy of Sri Lanka New York Stock Exchange Sea level rise Microeconomics Social Security debate (United States) Supply and demand Operation Market Garden Pinball Digital photography Theory Water (molecule) Equine conformation Employee stock option Dow Chemical Company Life insurance Bretton Woods system Economy of Pakistan Energy crisis Model (economics) Black hole Risk Tests of general relativity Free trade Explosive material Coercion Determinism Social Security (United States) Pound sterling Money 1957 World Series History of the United States (1918-1945) Progressive tax Economics Supernatural Enron Corporation FairTax Debugging Implications of peak oil Theory of conduct Drag racing Special relativity Economic inequality Predatory pricing Time travel Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Rational expectations Commodity markets Behavioral finance Petroleum Labour economics A Course In Miracles Classical mechanics General relativity Geometry Full moon cycle Bhopal disaster

how do i invest in limited partnerships what are the advantages disadvantages how much does it usually cost going in is there a company that helps match investors to ventures is there a way to invest something as little as k into this kind of financial tool ideally it would be nice to invest with many other people in a new building or other real estate please don't just say i should invest in stocks bonds or mutual funds a much better way to invest in commercial real estate is to purchase reit stocks limited partnerships are fraught with high fees and caretaker managers this is in contrast to a reit in which the manager takes an active role in growing the company and acquiring good rental properties basically limited partnerships are for suckers i have never read anything remotely positive about them especially after they lost their tax sheltered status also you'll need more than k to get into one for a good comparison or limited partnerships to reits download my free book at http www invest for retirement com and read page  Income trust Hedge fund Insurance Corporation Real estate developer Security (finance) Venture capital The Link REIT Annuity Gross domestic product Toronto-Dominion Bank Stock Corporate finance Investment bank Life insurance Berkshire Hathaway Microeconomics Financial services Securitization Capital accumulation Mergers and acquisitions Equity investment Temasek Holdings Tesco Finance Variable universal life insurance 401(k) Microcredit NASDAQ Short selling Bank Exchange-traded fund Individual Savings Account Islamic banking Free trade MMORPG Taxation in the United States Management information system Social Security debate (United States) Capitalism Private equity FairTax Economy of the United States Soci__t__ G__n__rale Business World Wide Web Publicly funded medicine Tax Free market Sears Holdings Corporation Economy of Russia Wal-Mart Eugene Fama Institutional fund management Advance fee fraud Lehman Brothers Stock market index Dividend Mortgage Retirement plan Housing cooperative Stock market Debt Intellectual property William N.

what does the term hedge funds mean the real definition is an investment company that uses high risk techniques such as borrowing money and selling short in an effort to make extraordinary capital gains in real world terms this means that a hedge fund is an investment fund charging a performance fee and typically open to only a limited range of investors in the united states hedge funds are open to accredited investors only because of this restriction they are usually exempt from any direct regulation by the sec nasd and other regulatory bodies though the funds do not necessarily hedge their investments against adverse market moves the term is used to distinguish them from regulated retail investment funds such as mutual funds and pension funds and from insurance companies hedge funds' activities are limited only by the terms of the contracts governing the particular fund they can follow complex investment strategies being long or short assets and entering into futures swaps and other derivative contracts the funds often organized as limited partnerships in the united states typically invest on behalf of institutions and high net worth individuals a common objective is to generate returns that are not closely correlated to those of the broader financial markets hedge funds are prohibited in most countries from marketing to non accredited investors at the same time they are not required to reveal to the public any information about themselves or their activities thus hedge funds generally exercise extreme secrecy and little is known with certainty about the activities of specific hedge funds or the industry as a whole  Corporation Bank Short selling Corporate finance Finance Financial markets Intellectual property Capital accumulation Trust (Law) USA Annuity Institutional fund management Life insurance Income trust Federal National Mortgage Association Goldman Sachs Tax Hedge (finance) Venture capital Risk Collateralized debt obligation Microeconomics Long-Term Capital Management Mortgage Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Financial services Citigroup Free trade Capitalism Variable universal life insurance Corporate governance Arbitrage Individual Savings Account Mergers and acquisitions Day trading Privatization Gold as an investment Enron Corporation Money supply Microcredit Economy of the United States United Kingdom corporation tax Pension Yield curve Short (finance) Monetary policy Publicly funded medicine Debt Mutual-fund scandal (2003) Risk management Taxation in the United States Morgan Stanley Islamic banking Technical analysis Passive management Natural monopoly Social Security debate (United States) Foreign exchange market Eugene Fama Ponzi scheme Closed-end fund Gross domestic product Capital asset pricing model Eliot Spitzer Real estate developer Copyleft Stock Article One of the United States Constitution Temasek Holdings NASDAQ Equity investment Elections in the United States Bretton Woods system Economy of Russia New Deal Social Security (United States) Toronto-Dominion Bank Lloyd's of London Interest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Exchange-traded fund Trade union SCO-Linux controversies

can i transfer or rollover my k before i leave the company i would like to rollover my k into an ira but i am not leaving the company is this allowed legally yes the irs allows you to rollover k money into a traditional ira at any time however most employers will not allow this usually you will have to quit retire be fired or become disabled to do this i do not recommend the latter two companies often times have exclusive contracts with the fund companies in their plan and do not want money of current employees going out the door to someone else also it becomes a major hassle for employers to rollover money every time an employee wants to move a little money to an ira most k plans are not heavily staffed and this would place an undue burden on them it's great when your employer does allow rollovers at any time however most will not allow rollovers until you sever employment often times it is the restrictions of the company plans that cause the problems not the irs wow i actually defended the irs so the lesson here is first check with your employer's plan before you spend time thinking about a rollover don't count those chickens before they're hatched  Individual Retirement Account Taxation in the United States Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Variable universal life insurance Social Security debate (United States) Unemployment Health insurance Flat tax Tax Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Health savings account Roth IRA Retirement plan School bus Money supply FairTax Asian financial crisis Apprenticeship Insurance Social Security (United States) H-1B visa Mutual fund Enron Corporation TIAA-CREF Publicly funded medicine Life insurance Microeconomics Wal-Mart Marshall Plan National Kidney Foundation Singapore Bretton Woods system Privatization Business continuity planning Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Airbag Security (finance) Risk management Ford Explorer Self-employment Coalition Provisional Authority Video game developer Contract Keynesian economics Public domain Economy of Russia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economy of Africa Florida Lottery Tom DeLay Civil rights Leeds United F.C.

question about bonds i have owned bonds before and always held them to maturity there is one part about bonds though where i always struggle with say for instance when a bond is issued yielding and interest rates go to does the bond price go higher or lower i know this is a silly question but somehow my brain does not get this bond prices move in the opposite direction of yield rate this is only something you need to worry about if you plan to sell the bond before it matures first there are two types of bonds government bonds are purchased at a par price a double e bond sells for and at maturity it is worth if you redeem it in between you get somewhere between and corporate bonds are generally bought at face value and the owner receives payments until maturity and it is then redeemed for face value these are the ones you buy sell or trade let's say the going yield today is and company xyz issues bonds at face value and you buy one for a year you collect interest payments of a month x then you want to sell if the current interest rate is up to a bond buyer can either buy your bond paying a month and will only pay for years or a new bond that pays a month for years obviously you would need to offer the buyer a discount for your bond if interest rates go down the opposite is true just remember opposite direction interest to price it does get much more complicated when you figure in bond rating and other factors  Treasury security Mutual fund Rational pricing Life insurance Security (finance) Futures contract Arbitrage Yield curve Municipal bond Mortgage Stock Monetary policy Tax Zero coupon bond Dividend Microeconomics Insurance U.S. public debt Capitalism Debt Gold standard Fixed income Interest Government National Mortgage Association Price discrimination Finance Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) FairTax Annuity Collateralized mortgage obligation Gross domestic product Supply and demand Bretton Woods system Auction Corporation Economy of Russia PE ratio Credit derivative Islamic banking Government debt High-yield debt Closed-end fund Housing cooperative Mergers and acquisitions Federal Reserve Collateralized debt obligation Social Security (United States) Fractional-reserve banking Deflation (economics) Hyperinflation Anarchism and capitalism Privatization Temasek Holdings Michael Milken Health insurance Ford Motor Company Surplus value Credit default swap Option Inflation Financial markets Publicly funded medicine Interest rate Stock market Airline Wal-Mart Investment bank Citigroup The South Sea Company Taxation in the United States Federal National Mortgage Association American Broadcasting Company Call option Mortgage-backed security Gilts Enron Corporation Bond duration Euro Free trade Subsidy Income trust Put option Measures of national income and output Economics Labor theory of value Liberty Dollar CBS Amway Social Security debate (United States)

what do you think about rolling over b the before or after tax status determines whether or not the money is eligible to be rolled over to a particular account most of the before tax accounts can be rolled into each other for example if you had a b previously and now have a k you can legally roll the money over to your new job's plan and vise versa and of course b money can be rolled into another b however this does not mean your new employer is required to accept the rollover many times it is the rules of your employer's plan that create problems for rollovers not rules set by the irs some employer plans will not accept rollover money or create such a hassle that you regret doing so ah but fear not there is a type of account called a rollover ira which is considered the universal recipient for any before tax money actually a rollover ira is a type of traditional ira we just give it this fancy name to denote what most people use it for the drawback is that you cannot contribute new money to a rollover ira however you can consolidate all your before tax accounts from previous employers into one rollover ira with almost any investment firm you now have free reign over how you retirement money is invested you are no longer bound by the limitations of your former employer's plan and if you become dissatisfied with your rollover ira guess what you can roll that to another rollover ira with another investment firm just keep rolling and you pay no taxes your former employer's plan may have restrictions about which accounts you can roll the money into for example it may not allow a direct rollover to another b even if the irs permits it however the law requires that all employer sponsored retirement accounts allow former employees the option to directly rollover their money to a rollover ira of the employee's choosing your past employer may suggest certain firms to roll over into but you can choose whatever firm you want you might need to do all the paperwork yourself but at least you can choose there are two ways to perform a rollover the first is called an indirect rollover with this you receive the check in your name and then send this money to your rollover ira provider you have days to do this or it counts as a distribution and you pay the taxes and penalties the old account provider must withhold of your money for tax purposes should you fail to complete the rollover you have to pony up that missing out of your own pocket and put it towards the rollover or that will count as a distribution the much better option is to use a direct rollover with direct rollovers the provider of your old account sends the check directly to the provider of your new account the check is made out to the trustee for the new provider with direct rollovers you never see the check and are not subject to the day rule or the mandatory withholding if something goes wrong with the transfer the money remains with the old account and you can try again yes it's frustrating if this happens but at least you don't run the risk of incurring a taxable distribution keep in mind that direct rollovers are not always smooth mine took months you may need to moderate the process by making calls to both providers some providers hassle you because they don't want to give up your money despite any hassles a direct rollover is far better than taking all your money as a taxable distribution i highly recommend rolling your money from past employer accounts into a rollover ira or your current employer's plan do not let that money sit with your old employer in order to release that money you will need approval from human resources this could be tricky if you left years ago human resources at your old job may look at your paper work and say who is this to avoid hassles down the road please rollover money soon after you sever employment just think once you get money into a rollover ira you no longer need human resource's permission for the love of all that is holy do not take a lump sum distribution from your old employer's retirement account no matter how old or drunk you are this counts as income which is taxable if the sum is large enough it could actually throw you into the tax bracket plus if you are under age you get an additional tax penalty you could wind up paying almost of your distribution to the tax man never to be seen again the ideal process is to never take a lump sum distribution even while in retirement withdraw only what you need so that you only pay taxes on that don't take lump sum distributions when you leave you job roll over that money instead preferably with a direct rollover  Taxation in the United States Life insurance Tax Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Mutual fund Constitution of the

regarding the world financial group my friend said if i put my money in insurance they will invest it in mutual funds even losing money they will still pay me percent of interest my original money is this possible that means i wont losing money even the price of mutual fund i invest in is falling or is this a lie wikipedia says wfg requires an initial deposit of only to gain access to their actively managed funds what does that mean isn't just paying the dollar back ground check to start out or initiallly havng to put in the account sincerely do heavy research on this subject my family has purchased wfg's insurance product services which they call vul the only reason they're promoting this product is because those agents get paid high commission for it my family is being tied down by vul which is the insurance product they're trying to sell you those agents will tell you that you should expect a return of percent or higher a year but the fact is the return is more like percent a year which is worse than having your money in a bank account you can't withdraw your money and they require you to borrow your money from your account for percent interest rate it's your money and you have to borrow it my mom has been paying for vul for the past years she puts in there a month right now there's in her account how you like that for an investment  Mutual fund Bank Variable universal life insurance Bond Citigroup Life insurance Annuity Inflation Finance Mortgage Bretton Woods system Social Security (United States) Stock American International Group Financial services Hyperinflation Financial markets Economy of Russia Capital accumulation Monetary policy Savings and loan association Asian financial crisis Hedge fund Goldman Sachs Short selling Money supply Economy of Pakistan Warren Buffett Credit card Microcredit Gold standard Money creation FairTax Security (finance) Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Gross domestic product 401(k) PE ratio Certificate of deposit Yield curve Euro Primerica Financial Services Islamic banking Federal Reserve United Kingdom corporation tax Money Capitalism Lloyd's of London Temasek Holdings Economy of India Individual Savings Account Gold as an investment Contract Privatization Derivative (finance) Reaganomics Economy of the United States Government debt Economic relations of Japan Tax Keynesian economics Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Divorce Debt Advance fee fraud Say's law Mergers and acquisitions Stock broker Wells Fargo Publicly funded medicine Credit union Institutional fund management Anarchism and capitalism Economy of Japan New Deal Universal life insurance Income trust Economic history of Japan Predatory lending Personal finance Toronto-Dominion Bank Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Corporate finance Margin (finance) Economy of Chile Unemployment Collateralized debt obligation

little help figuring out stock prices i understand the basics on stock prices however what i dont understand is how a stock can close one day at say but the second the market reopens you will see the stock at how you would think it would have to move up to that price not just open at that price also i was looking at after hours quote for lend and the price is however the ask price is does that the stock will move up on monday morning durning the market stock prices can open much higher or lower than the prevous close because of an imbalance of supply and demand if some news occurs ater the prerious day's close for instance news comes out that a company that had a closing price of per share is the object of a takeover bid at a share then there will be huge demand for that stock at the open and it will rapidly run up or the news could be bad for example after the market close news comes out that federal authorities are investigating the company for making false reports the stock could easily open at lower than it closed technically the higher opening is called a gap up and the lower opening is called a gap down also you should ignore bid ask spreads after the close they mean nothing  Arbitrage Day trading Deflation (economics) Foreign exchange market Technical analysis Mutual fund Monetary policy Natural monopoly PE ratio Stock market Economy of Russia Enron Corporation Supply and demand Citigroup Bretton Woods system Tesco Capital accumulation Wall Street Crash of 1929 Gold standard Short selling Microeconomics Economics Asian financial crisis Efficient market hypothesis Supply-side economics Sears Holdings Corporation Yield curve Money supply Wal-Mart Money Takeover Equity investment Airline Keynesian economics Bond Microsoft September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for September New York Stock Exchange NASDAQ Law of value Inflation Stock market index Labour economics Insider trading Exchange value Mikhail Khodorkovsky Closed-end fund Eircom Gold as an investment Solar cell Initial public offering Hurricane Rita Monopoly (game) Central bank Dow Theory United Kingdom corporation tax Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Financial markets Bank of America Malcolm Glazer takeover of Manchester United Hyperinflation Rupert Murdoch New Deal Mergers and acquisitions Surplus value Corporation Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Education in the People's Republic of China MMORPG Stock exchange Privatization Auction Shrimp farm Temasek Holdings Tariff Federal Reserve MG Rover Group Insurance Hard disk Action potential 1973 oil crisis Wells Fargo CNBC Labor theory of value Progressive tax Market capitalization Price discrimination Monopoly Video game crash of 1983 Photography Economy of Nigeria Dot-com __lectricit__ de France Balassa-Samuelson effect Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Neoclassical economics Commodity Economy of India

why would buying a fund be better than buying each dow stock on a dollar investment i would pay in commissions after all have been bought and sold lets say that the investment lasts years the commission would be higher because of all the spin offs over a year period there would be many splits and many dividends would i make more on a dia fund or more buying all the individual stocks one by one with a fund where do all the dividends go into the fund handlers hand do the spin offs of dia stocks account in a fund are they added into the fund i guess you have dissect every word on here i meant the fees that i would have to pay for selling the spin offs if all you want to do is track the djia then you should just buy the stocks yourself as you mentioned a mutual fund will be professionally managed and will charge huge fees if you use zecco com then trading is free so use that if you buy the individual stocks so that you dont pay any fees in a fund the dividends still eventually get paid to the fund holders as far as spin offs etc the fund manager has control over what to do he may heavily weight some stocks and hold very little of another it all depends  Mutual fund Stock PE ratio Annuity Bond Citigroup Exchange-traded fund Hedge fund United Kingdom corporation tax Short selling Insurance Dow Jones Industrial Average Dividend Equity investment Taxation in the United States Warren Buffett Stock market index Microeconomics Corporate finance Corporation Wall Street Crash of 1929 Stock broker Individual Savings Account Financial markets Derivative (finance) Security (finance) Bretton Woods system Gold as an investment Institutional fund management NASDAQ Federal Reserve Investment bank Bank Income trust Finance Technical analysis Option style Tax Microsoft Social Security debate (United States) Life insurance Foreign exchange market Enron Corporation Capital accumulation Anarchism and capitalism Variable universal life insurance Euro S&P 500 Mergers and acquisitions Wheel of Fortune Margin (finance) Futures contract 401(k) Deflation (economics) Monetary policy Venture capital Temasek Holdings Lloyd's of London Supply and demand Social Security (United States) Publicly funded medicine Closed-end fund American International Group Eliot Spitzer Passive management Mortgage Monopoly (game) Fiat money Economy of Russia Employee stock option Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Morgan Stanley Rational pricing Surplus value Dot-com Money Wal-Mart Credit card Student loan Sears Holdings Corporation MMORPG Trust (Law) USA Day trading Economy of Chile SCO-Linux controversies Arbitrage Mikhail Khodorkovsky Toll road Andrew Carnegie Philatelic investment Financial services Mutual-fund scandal (2003) Retirement plan Usury Primerica Financial Services Supply-side economics

what makes an individual stock worth it's price i understand the law of supply and demand so that when more people want to buy the price goes up and vice versa but what makes people want to buy for example i think company a has a good idea for a product why do i buy their stock just in hopes other people will want it in the future and be willing to pay more for it do dividends make a company more enticing to buy do all companies give dividends is there a ratio between the stocks a company has and its earnings is this the p e ratio how do i interpret the p e ratio what are its units something is still missing serge mentioned 'discounted cash flows' which i will look into is it just about owning sexy stocks so i can say i own shares of xxx to my friends is there a direct link between profits and share price is there one additional scenario company a is consistently profitable offers consistent dividends company b has high expected profits and is looking for growth is my only criteria for investment what i think the demand for stock will be in the future am i just betting on what other people will want in the future this is confusing oh wait will companies eventually buy back the stock issue are you betting on the price the company will be willing to pay to buy back the stock hmmm you are correct about the supply and demand issue investors will demand the shares of a company when they evaluate the company and decide what they think it will accomplish in the future theoretically the current price of the stock is the discounted value of its future cash flows however no one knows what the future will bring investors look at what the company owns what it is earning by employing its resources what the prospects are for the earnings to grow the company's position in its industry and many other factors that determine how much they ar willing to pay for a share all companies do not pay dividends whether dividends make a stock more enticing really depends on the investor investors who are interested in dividend income will look for stocks that have a good history of stable dividend payments investors who prefer capital gains will look for companies that are plowing their earnings back into operations in order to grow take advantage of new technology and develop new products the price earnings ratio is a measure of how expensive a stock is a stock that is earning per share has a p e ratio of another stock earning per share has a p e ratio of the second stock is more expensive i e you have to pay twice as much for a dollar of earnings why is the p e ratio of the second stock so much higher probably because investors perceive the first stock will continue earning per share but they think the second stock may earn per share next year per share the year after and per share the year after that they are willing to pay more for the prospect of rapidly growing earnings  Insurance Inflation Arbitrage Capital accumulation Warren Buffett Capitalism Annuity Derivative (finance) Short selling Income statement Economy of India Technical analysis Income trust Gold standard Rational pricing Debt United Kingdom corporation tax Equity investment Economy of Russia Cost of capital Deflation (economics) Mergers and acquisitions Surplus value Taxation in the United States Tax Gold as an investment Corporation Microsoft Margin (finance) Temasek Holdings The South Sea Company Investment bank FairTax Life insurance Supply and demand Dot-com Real estate economics Stock market Sears Holdings Corporation Bank Yield curve Financial markets Law of value Finance Capital asset pricing model Berkshire Hathaway Flat tax Bretton Woods system Gross domestic product Modern portfolio theory Privatization Money Airline Citigroup Conglomerate (company) Black-Scholes Islamic banking Futures contract Day trading Supply-side economics Economy of the United States Monetary policy Labor theory of value Hedge fund Economic relations of Japan Philatelic investment Economics Individual Savings Account NASDAQ Economy of Pakistan Enron Corporation Intellectual property Economic rent Social Security debate (United States) Economy of Venezuela Progressive tax Exchange-traded fund Manitoba Hydro Efficiency wages Security (finance) Labour economics Ford Motor Company Free trade Economic inequality Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Organic composition of capital

should i set up my tax lien investment group as an llc or corporation i have about people in my group that want to invest in tax liens we don't want to draw any salaries because our startup capital is quite low however we want the liability protection what makes better sense to form an llc or corporation either way we would file s corp status both entity types provide liability protection a corporation for which you file an s corp election has the advantage that its pretty easy to find off the shelf corporation docs that you can use and the body of law on corporations is well established if you have foreign investors or you want any type of complicated voting or economic structure lets say that you want some people to have economic but not voting rights or that some class of people get extra money because they also manage the company an llc is better because while an s corp is only allowed one class of stock you can create multiple classes of llc membership interests with different rights preferences and privileges you might think can't corporations create difference classes of shares with different rights preference and privileges the answer is yes but you can't create a corporation with multiple class types and make an s corp election not permitted under irs rules also an llc allows you to forego having annual meetings etc but you do need to put more work in drafting an llc agreement up front llc agreements are less off the shelf if you use an off the shelf llc agreement you are risking a lot more than using off the shelf articles of incorporation just as one more clarification for a corporation to get pass through tax treatment you make an s corp election for an llc you don't you make a check the box election to be treated as a partnership llcs are pass through tax entities but s corp is a term reserved for corporation who make such an election and llcs are not corporations search using www yahoo com search  Limited liability company Mutual fund United Kingdom corporation tax Stock Flat tax Income trust Free trade Capitalism Cooperative Incorporation (business) Microsoft Security (finance) Mortgage Article One of the United States Constitution Lloyd's of London Corporate finance Finance Corporate governance Bank Politics of the United States Annuity Bretton Woods system FairTax Life insurance Trust (Law) USA Congress of the United States Berkshire Hathaway Democracy Civil rights Politics of Russia Bond Economy of India Government of France Hedge fund Microcredit 401(k) Mergers and acquisitions Royal Dutch Shell Google Pretty Good Privacy Civil union Warren Buffett Ethernet Citigroup Dividend Government debt British House of Commons Financial services Australian constitutional law Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Tax protester Corporate personhood Copyright Individual Savings Account Offshore company Intellectual property Contract Capital accumulation USA PATRIOT Act Investment bank Trademark Tom DeLay European Union Airline Federal Reserve Debt United States Army Eliot Spitzer New Deal Separation of church and state Constitution of India Unlawful combatant Arturo Frondizi Globalization Expert system Economy of South Africa Commonwealth of Nations Income tax Immigration to the United States Internet Relay Chat Venture capital Class action United States House of Representatives Software patent debate Municipal bond Conrail

what happens to my stock if a company declares bankruptcy i own a few hundred shares of ahm american home mortgage and i only bought it a few days ago thinking that it was as low as it could get and now they are talking about bankruptcy i am wondering what will happen to my shares will i ever be re imbursed if the company comes out of bankruptcy if they come out of bankruptcy will i be able to make a profit over the next years if the company takes off again an has no debts left will i be able to trade my shares like normal if they come out of bankruptcy is it likely that i can still make a profit if they go bankrupt pay of the creditors and the business takes off again bankrupt stocks are a write off you can only hope they will try use bankruptcy protection methods to prevent a total collapse but the way the mortgage industry is looking right now i would say the chances of being bailed out by a buyout firm are slim just hope they won't fold what most companies do when they come out of bankruptcy is restructure their entire share system its really hard to say whether or not you are still going to get a piece of the new pie although more often than not you don't these new shares can be traded normally on the market read up on the history of companies like delta airlines and air canada they will give two different scenarios of how companies emerge out of bankruptcy  Bankruptcy Enron Corporation Airline Bond Deflation (economics) Delta Air Lines Debt Donald Trump Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Bank Arbitrage United Airlines Dot-com Stock Mergers and acquisitions Corporation Security (finance) Northwest Airlines The South Sea Company Mutual fund Sears Holdings Corporation Ryanair Economy of Russia Privatization Insurance Natural monopoly Stock market Gold as an investment Revco Warren Buffett Aerol__neas Argentinas Citigroup Eaton's Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Short selling Timeline of the Enron scandal America West Airlines Corporate finance Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Tesco Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code Bankruptcy in the United States Day trading Interest Ford Motor Company Mississippi Company Derivative (finance) Conrail History of the United States (1918-1945) British Airways Economy of the United States PE ratio MG Rover Group Money Avianca Temasek Holdings Pan American World Airways Raleigh-Durham International Airport US Airways NASDAQ Intellectual property Capital accumulation Corporate governance Financial markets Takeover Social Credit Marconi Corporation plc Boston and Lowell Railroad Economy of Romania Dairy Air New Zealand Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Pets.com Royal Dutch Shell Strategic management Olympic Airlines Leveraged buyout PSINet Trade Unemployment Islamic banking United Kingdom corporation tax Economy of Argentina Lloyd's of London Poker jargon Sega Publishing Air Canada Frequent flyer program FairTax Gold standard Greyhound Lines Article One of the United States Constitution

future value question get your calculator i have a simple future value question so i thought if you put in a savings account at the beginning of each year for years how much will be in the account at the end of the th year the account earns i put n i pv pmt and got as the future value however this is wrong that will be the value on the first day of the th year so then i changed n to and subtracted the payment on the first day of the st year by doing this i got as the value at the end of the th year is my logic right by doing it this way is that going to be the value at the end of the th year thanks in advance i think your logic works and the correct answer is another way to calculate it would be to take the that you got for the value after the deposit at the beginning of year and multiply it by to account for the interest it will earn during the th year to verify i used a spreadsheet to calculate for each year column a has the value of column b for the previous year to account for the deposit at the beginning of the year and column b has the value of column a for the current year to account for the interest during the year in year column b has which seems to confirm that your logic and my logic above are both correct ways to calculate it what the first answerer actually calculated was the value at the end of the th year which is not what you want  Annuity Mathematics Calculator Scientific method Intelligent design Binary numeral system Bond Personal finance CPU design Hamming code Physics Mathematician FairTax Logic Philosophy of science Philosophy of language Database Microeconomics Social Security (United States) Bayesian inference Elementary arithmetic Credit card The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything Computer Maya calendar Gross domestic product Napier's bones Plame affair Gaussian elimination Philosophy of mathematics Monty Hall problem Jeopardy!

why finding the net present value payback and internal rate of return are important for a company a company has to have a certain rate of return to maintain its value it must exceed its cost of capital to do that and those are methods for the company to determine if their projects are exceeding their cost of capital and adding to the value of the company a project with a quicker payback is on the whole better because of the time value of money money now is better than money later because you can invest it  Corporate finance Profit Gross domestic product Present value Inflation Solar cell Capitalism Cost of capital Life insurance Labor theory of value Mutual fund 401(k) FairTax Tax Insurance Microeconomics Debt Finance Depreciation Space Shuttle program Economy of Norway Bank Manitoba Hydro Interest Economics Social Security (United States) Security (finance) Islamic banking Privatization Financial markets Derivative (finance) Michael Milken Financial services Surplus value Corporation Capital gains tax Social Security debate (United States) Economy of South Africa Bretton Woods system Hyperinflation Wealth Corporate governance Balance of payments Economy of Russia Institutional fund management Minimum wage F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Stock Political economy Income trust Economic rent Airline Annuity Yield curve Variable universal life insurance Energy development Economy of the United States Payback (film) Capital asset pricing model PE ratio Slot machine United States Postal Service Bond Economy of Colombia Oil shale Labour economics Anarchism and capitalism Economy of India Monopoly Law of value Principal-agent problem Free trade Capital accumulation Cost accounting Modern portfolio theory Taxation in the United States Space habitat Mergers and acquisitions Economic inequality Berkshire Hathaway Economic growth Venture capital Warren Buffett __lectricit__ de France Call centre Capital controversy Transformation problem Exogenous growth model Economy of the People's Republic of China Political corruption Argentine Currency Board Weighted average cost of capital American Broadcasting Company Intellectual property Capital punishment in the United States Islamic economics United Kingdom corporation tax Microcredit Heckscher-Ohlin model Production theory basics

what's your take on the stock markets declining it's not just ours japan and europe as well someone give me a more complex answer as to why all this is going on or your thoughtful opinion on it the news treats us like idiots it seems and i would like a more thorough explanation see pj's answer read much like a newspaper it seems they tell you the surface and don't explain why things change the market so drastically and why other markets are reacting mainstream just states it doesn't explain it i always figured media should educate and inform i'm sorry for offending you and making it sound like i don't read the news what's important is this matter is that i wondered about it enough to find more info via yahoo answers please don't criticize me and keep this a friendly informative question truthfully as an economist and really one of the best investors in the world no one knows the news needs to report something and if we answered the news with shrugged shoulders they wouldn't be happy there are a lot of specific things going on here the big one is true liquidity crisis cash is king as the saying goes for a long time private investors were buying subprime mortgages and at very low interest rates but at interest rates above market rates the problem with subprime and alt a loans is that we do not know how they will react under stress the subprime market is now defaulting on of the outstanding loans if you are charging a interest rate that is a huge loss this should just be a blip on the screen except these loans are in portfolios and since no one will buy them their price is effectively if you owe hundreds of millions of dollars have no cash on hand cannot sell your mortgages then you start selling anything you can sell to meet cash needs because lenders are getting jittery and demanding either repayment or additional collateral that is the public story now the rest of the story the us stock market is way overvalued especially under inflationary expectations and considering the level of global uncertainty but prices in markets are rarely rational they are just the result of bidding many institutional investor s are seeking liquidity or alternative higher yielding investments in other global markets additionally this white house has way overspent the last time the us was this indebted to foreign governments was the civil war but bush would never have been able to meet his campaign promises on our money alone he promised things america actually doesn't have the money to buy but he bought it anyway to add to the pain the average us citizen is indebted substantially to the people's republic of china china has been happily loaning billion per day to keep america floating about three months ago they said it is time to diversify their foreign holdings in other words the party is over and as if we needed more the current retirement commitments of the us government exceed the present value of all private assets in the united states in other words under this administration they have not only mortgaged the entire nation but extra there is a nice set of papers by gokhale on intergenerational obligations and then you have simple panic stock prices are cauchy distributed to put that in ordinary terms stock prices swing far wider than a normal distribution ever would and we experience a normal world when it stops behaving normally we either get excited in an asset bubble or panicked as in a crash people are afraid and there is a lot of money to be made in fear stocks are gyrating in weird ways weird stocks make huge gains and weird stocks crash stocks that should not move together are now moving together and stocks that should move together have stopped doing so and these are just observations not reasons there are no reasons it just is we live in a global society now if you think as an american you are missing the point borders mean far less than they ever did among the developed nations a crisis anywhere is a crisis here oh yes and i left out risks to the energy supply and iraq iran and of course our beloved leader w and these are just the issues going on on the surface how many people out there are cashing in money to have money for health care but we cannot see them doing it it is easy to attribute stock movements to big macro events but the real answer is that millions of small transactions are occurring simultaneously and the stock market is the residual of left over money not put in the bank and not eaten driven slept under slept on or slept with  Mergers and acquisitions

do bond call features and bond put features help reduce risk for bond investors there are different types of risk for the sake of your question we will cover optional calls and puts a call option at the issuer's discretion can add to your interest rate risk in issuer can call your bond this will happen when interest rates have declined this results in you having cash and be forced to reinvest your money at a lower yield a put option at the bondholder's discretion will lower your credit risk and your interest rate risk if you decide you have lost faith in the issuer you can exercise your option and get your money back and invest it in something safer if interest rates have increased you can exercise your option and invest your money at a higher rate of return though both of the previous answers have truth to consider there is also another factor to consider which is duration duration is the change in the dollar value of a fixed income security that will result from a percentage change in interest yield the shorter the duration of your bond then less money you will lose if interest rates go up conversely if interest rates go down the less your bond will appreciate if you have a bond with a premium coupon the coupon is greater than the market yield and a call you will feel less of an effect then a noncall bond of the same coupon and maturity this benefit does not apply if the bonds are trading at a discount in short both call and put features can reduce some types of risk to the bondholder  Yield curve Rational pricing Interest Municipal bond Mutual fund Life insurance Security (finance) Fixed income Arbitrage Monetary policy Zero coupon bond Debt Corporate finance Convertible bond Futures contract Credit card Collateralized debt obligation Treasury security Mortgage-backed security Cost of capital Government National Mortgage Association Insurance Modern portfolio theory Income trust Microeconomics FairTax Annuity Dividend Credit derivative High-yield debt Taxation in the United States Hyperinflation Privatization Mortgage Social Security debate (United States) Margin (finance) Repurchase agreement Euro Bond duration Gold standard Deflation (economics) Economy of Russia PE ratio Investment Collateralized mortgage obligation Ponzi scheme Capital accumulation Variable universal life insurance Option adjusted spread Government bond Leverage (finance) Charles Ponzi Bank Free trade Progressive tax Supply-side economics Capital asset pricing model Derivative (finance) Asian financial crisis Bretton Woods system Stock Bond convexity Capitalism Surplus value Tariff Social Security (United States) Financial markets Decompression sickness Keynesian economics Economy of Pakistan Black-Scholes Argentine Currency Board Risk Supply and demand Labour economics Economy of India Brady Bonds Tax Universal life insurance Hedge fund Citigroup Financial services Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Institutional fund management Moody's Money supply Eugene Fama Federal National Mortgage Association

whats the best way to invest funds for a h s scholarship tax breaks type of account ect my daughter recently died and i want to use her savings and establish a scholarship fund in her name at her school i'm not sure what type of savings account to set up i would probably invest the money in bonds and maybe a mutual fund not sure what's the best way to do this i want the scholarship to last forever i'm so sorry your daughter died it's a wonderful idea to set up a fund to honor her memory so many kids will be able to benefit from that in years to come i think the best person to ask would be a lawyer because you have stipulations you say that you want the fund to last forever the best way to do that is to make sure the principal is protected and only the interest or gains are distributed then you could let relatives and friends and the public know that they can donate money to the fund in her memory and it will grow even larger a lawyer would be able to handle the tax questions about what you are doing also if you just donate the money to the school then you lose the power to make the money 'last forever' for this reason i think a lawyer is your best resource a competent tax attorney perhaps get recommendations from people in the school administration and town tread carefully and discuss fees before making any commitments  Mutual fund Annuity Life insurance Trust (Law) USA Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Corporation 401(k) Social Security debate (United States) Mortgage Social Security (United States) Variable universal life insurance Microeconomics Bank Income trust Supply-side economics Student loan Pension Lawyer Hedge fund Tax Bond Education in the People's Republic of China Taxation in the United States Keynesian economics Flat tax Bretton Woods system Monetary and fiscal policy of Japan New Deal Deflation (economics) Open access United Kingdom corporation tax National Kidney Foundation Singapore Capital accumulation Reaganomics Minimum wage Health insurance FairTax Plame affair Hillary Rodham Clinton Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Gross domestic product Monetary policy Retirement plan Intellectual property Ponzi scheme Government debt Toronto-Dominion Bank Finance U.S. public debt Boston Public Public domain Economy of Russia Scholarship Tort reform Treasury security Primerica Financial Services Microcredit London mayoral election, 2004 Mergers and acquisitions New Hampshire Supreme Court Michael Milken Stock Capitalism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Warren Buffett Security (finance) SAT Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Affirmative action American Red Cross SCO-Linux controversies Investment bank Sun Myung Moon Anarchism and capitalism Food and Drug Administration Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Theory of conduct Software patent debate Registered Retirement Savings Plan Copyleft Nuclear power Money supply Institutional fund management Education in the United States Unemployment benefit Politics of Canada Coingate Marshall Plan Municipal bond Confidence trick Eliot Spitzer Citigroup Free trade Privatization Bank fraud National Savings and Investments Inflation

why do corporate bonds prices change even when fed interest rates remain unchanged supply and demand is right but there are many reasons that affect both supply and demand if information comes out that changes the perceived risk for a corporate bond then the price and yield will change if you heard that a company's best selling product now caused cancer the prospect for that company just changed radically and their ability to repay their loan probably changed this would be reflected in the price of the bond and then the yield of that bond if a company issues a huge amount of new debt then that debt or bond is in greater supply and it will drive the price down the major credit rating agencies are supposed to monitor these things and base their ratings on the companies ability to generate enough money to pay their creditors sometimes events happen faster than the credit agencies can respond the events with some of these sub prime lenders is a topical example  Debt Bond Deflation (economics) Bank Monetary policy Insurance Mortgage Finance Inflation Interest Microeconomics Bretton Woods system Economy of Russia Hyperinflation Predatory lending Money supply Gold standard Arbitrage Government debt Municipal bond Federal Reserve High-yield debt Fractional-reserve banking Credit card Asian financial crisis Social Security (United States) Interest rate Life insurance Capital accumulation Financial markets Mergers and acquisitions Collateralized debt obligation Money Security (finance) Corporation Student loan U.S. public debt Cost of capital Credit rating agency Labor theory of value Credit derivative Michael Milken Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Federal National Mortgage Association Temasek Holdings Debt levels and flows Great Depression Mutual fund Mortgage-backed security Annuity Ford Motor Company Economy of the United States Islamic banking Stock Usury Corporate finance Gold as an investment FairTax Taxation in the United States Rational pricing Supply-side economics Estoppel Credit history Government National Mortgage Association PE ratio Developing countries' debt Commodity markets Short selling Investment bank Dividend Financial analyst Credit default swap Citigroup Business cycle Moody's Central bank Nuclear power Gross domestic product Financial services Anarchism and capitalism Futures contract Treasury security Price discrimination Income trust Economics Economy of India Principal-agent problem Keynesian economics Government bond Advertising History of the United States (1918-1945)

in investing what is the significance of understanding the way futures trade what do they measure what can we infer from watching them thanks futures trade is like expert opinion from oldies of market i am sure you want to know the methodology and concept futures trade has two most important aspects mitigating risk early buying and selling as per requirment mitigating risk is big issue lets take an example of oil america is forcasting that oil prices may high from usd to usd in next month so they will do an agreement with opec to supply us oil on next month and prices are todays this will be trade date on maturity america will receive oil usd no matter what is current price of oil it may either be or second point is little complicated suppose you are manufacturer of leather goods and you need raw material you know that best season for leather products is winter ultimately your supplies will go higher aswell so you ask your supplier to supply raw material in november you can pay upto of total trade in november no matter how much burden your supplier has since he is suppling to other companies aswell he is liable to send you your raw material thats how you will have no shortage in your supplies and then distribution as far as measurement is concern it is purely experience market gurus have enough analysis of commodities and their behaviour that they can easily guess what would be future outcome so they take decision on the basis of their analysis if you are interested in market i say choose best stocks which you think can be better option then study them everyday and go through their previous two years within a month you'll be able to analyse their behaviour upto good luck  Economics Microeconomics Supply and demand Capitalism Labor theory of value Inflation Law of value Free trade Economy of Venezuela Bond Euro Surplus value Petroleum Commodity markets Economy of Pakistan Future energy development Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 United Kingdom corporation tax Corporate finance Economic relations of Japan Economy of Russia Nuclear power Futures contract Capital accumulation Monopoly Comprehensive Program for Socialist Economic Integration Economy of Africa Mutual fund Insurance Economy of the United States Foreign exchange market PE ratio Political economy Labour economics Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Anarchism and capitalism Free market Bretton Woods system Rational pricing Monetary policy Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Privatization Gross domestic product Natural monopoly Economy of Nigeria Economy of Japan Derivative (finance) Exchange value Economy of India Corporate governance Arbitrage Deflation (economics) Hubbert peak theory Yield curve Stock market Plastic Causality Security (finance) Supply-side economics Software patent debate Trade Kyoto Protocol Gold standard Health insurance Economy of Ghana Alcohol fuel Nuclear power phase-out Gasoline Oil-for-Food Programme Money Famine Asian financial crisis Economy of Norway Implications of peak oil Oil depletion Great Depression Annuity Electronic commerce Service economy Economy of Belgium Tax Economy of Mexico Investment bank Leather United States dollar MMORPG Economy of Sri Lanka Financial markets

how can i rent my stocks i have a large portfolio someone mentioned i can rent these out to options markets can you provide more info your friend is talking about writing options easiest exlanation is an example if you own shares of company xyz and it is currently selling at per share if this is a large enough company and people are interested in buying options on it what you do is write an option for someone else to buy shares of xyz at per share in december what this means is someone will buy this right from you if when december rolls around the company is selling at say per share this person will buy your shares off you for per share you essentially lost because you had to sell your shares at when they were worth but when the person bought this option off you they had to pay probably also remember that when you wrote the option the stock was at per share so the portion of the runup from to you keep so you really made also suppose the stock had stayed at when december rolled around the person who bought the option had the option to buy the stock at but since the market only charged they would not exercise the option they'd be out the they gave you when you wrote the option essentially you just made for doing nothing i hope that helps a bit but you'd better read up on writing options specifically i'd do a google search on covered call writing anyhow though you friend is talking about writing options this will get you some income over time but i personally have not found the technique very useful maybe you'll have more success at it  Employee stock option Stock Option Finance Mutual fund Put option Call option Annuity Stock market Black-Scholes Monopoly (game) Warren Buffett Taxation in the United States Arbitrage Short selling Put-call parity Executive compensation Security (finance) PE ratio Citigroup Enron Corporation Bond 401(k) Insurance Berkshire Hathaway Margin (finance) Option style Capital accumulation Life insurance Dot-com Day trading Health insurance Financial markets Internet fraud IBM PC compatible Insider trading Corporation Capitalism Derivative (finance) Timeline of the Enron scandal Economic rent Futures contract Dividend Social rule Temasek Holdings Poker jargon United Kingdom corporation tax Corporate finance Warrant (finance) Closed-end fund Gross domestic product American individualist anarchism Atari Leasehold estate Open access Tesco Harken Energy Scandal Mergers and acquisitions Hedge fund Wall Street Crash of 1929 Fixed income Blackjack Fuzion Search engine optimization Privatization Estoppel Communication skill Stock broker Long-Term Capital Management Sears Holdings Corporation Tax Google Video game publisher Stock market index BitTorrent Neopets Institutional fund management Rational pricing Surplus value Leasing Housing cooperative Technical analysis O scale Money Blockbuster Video Advertising Xbox 360 Steve Jobs Property (ownership right) Eircom Frank Herbert Gold as an investment Corporate governance New Coke Financial services Anarchism and capitalism Conglomerate (company) Financial analyst

i've newly gotten a stock broker and i'd like to put my money where my mouth is so if you were me what proverbs say's the rich rule over the poor and the borrower is servant to the lender so sence i've spent enough time being poor and ruled over the wrong way and a borrower owing the lender more then i borrowed i figured way not go it i'll end up making more in stoke's then i'm making being poor so why not what do i have to lose i'm already poor but i was asked what comoditie's would you like to invest in and i said hum let me get back to you on that now who do i ask that know's what i don't know i know i have yahoo answers to ask so here i am to ask what is a comoditie which one do i invest in i know somebody knows and no i don't have any shame in asking i was alway's taught if you don't know ask lots of good advice given so far by others educate yourself read look at the journey good stuff the best advice for long term investing is just that invest for the long term get an and stay in lots of folks chase yesterday's winners now today's dogs buying high and selling low being in the market over time is the best and most proven way there will a small number of days to see gains losses inthe stock market if you are on the sidelines you will miss this i see it all the time a commodity like gold oil cash crops etc carries a high risk due to volatility it is certainly a specialty i wouldn't advise this as your first only entry into the market regarding where to look international has done well i would imagine that trend would continue but this is a area with zero guarantees a wholesaler at conservative firm witha track record of less volatilty than most other firms told me their research says that now is the time to look into large cap stocks if you look at the top companies listed in the s p these large companies are trading at a very low price relative to their earnings essentially they are on sale their performance and balance sheets are strong especially when compared to the internet stocks of years ago this looks good for the more immediate time horizon but be sure to do your own homework and review items periodically reviewing asset allocation is also key checking daily on a long term investment takes a strong stomach ask around for a referral to a good advisor start simple and conservatively to see how you feel about market swings you have to be able to sleep at night the market will go up the market will go down if you are ok with the risk and it meets your individual profile then adjust accordingly your advisor registered rep can assist here systematic investments are great ways to contribute and build something these allow you to toss in a month or whatever into a mutual fund the important thing is that it be consistent if the market is down you are buying items on sale just get a plan and keep with your plan  Bond Finance Short selling Bank Investment bank Mortgage Capital accumulation Financial markets Microeconomics Hedge fund Insurance Mergers and acquisitions Citigroup Security (finance) Stock market Derivative (finance) Monetary policy Deflation (economics) Debt Privatization Arbitrage Institutional fund management Gross domestic product Capitalism Technical analysis NASDAQ Eugene Fama Free trade Ra (board game) Economy of India Social Security debate (United States) Supply-side economics Interest Economy of Pakistan Temasek Holdings Capital asset pricing model Warren Buffett Gold as an investment Annuity Day trading Economy of the United States Tax History of the United States (1918-1945) FairTax The Apprentice 2 Option Economy of Africa Tesco Asset Financial services Wal-Mart Exchange-traded fund Economics Economy of Nigeria Supply and demand Stock broker Keynesian economics Asian financial crisis Predatory lending Berkshire Hathaway Political economy Bank fraud Gold standard Income trust Poker jargon Student loan Strategic management Inventory United Kingdom corporation tax Commodity markets Modern portfolio theory Economic history of Japan Arthur Laffer Economy of Chile American Broadcasting Company Bretton Woods system Common Agricultural Policy Internet fraud Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Trade Money supply Islamic banking Donald Trump Model (economics) Personal finance Enron Corporation Great Depression Surplus value Commodity Usury Economy of C__te d'Ivoire

stocks splitting what is the purpose of a company splitting it's stocks and what are some tell tail signs that a stock may be splitting soon the purpose to stock splitting is to do a couple of things first it keeps the price lower so that more smaller investors can afford to purchase the stock second it dilutes the shares so that control of the company is spread out making it harder for other companies or larger shareholders to own too much of the vote thirdly it helps the larger shareholders see management to double down on the stock because there is usually a slight increase in price after a split fund managers and individual investors keep buying and this also has a positive effect on a companies capital to spot a company that has a good chance of a stock split look for companies that have strong stable earnings a large sustained increase in price over the last year or two and are a leader in their industry  Mutual fund PE ratio Mergers and acquisitions Stock market Corporation Capital accumulation Hedge fund Bond Dividend Stock market index Asian financial crisis Exchange-traded fund Security (finance) Stock split Arbitrage Institutional fund management Derivative (finance) Warren Buffett Corporate finance Citigroup Berkshire Hathaway Short selling Temasek Holdings Investment bank Economy of Russia Intellectual property Venture capital United Kingdom corporation tax Closed-end fund Wal-Mart Sears Holdings Corporation Employee stock option Microeconomics Dot-com Equity investment Morgan Stanley Mutual-fund scandal (2003) Finance __lectricit__ de France Stock exchange Capital gains tax Microsoft Market capitalization NASDAQ Hyperinflation Bretton Woods system Privatization Takeover American Broadcasting Company Hedge (finance) Foreign exchange market Day trading Economy of Sri Lanka Mikhail Khodorkovsky Corporate raid Income Modern portfolio theory Enron Corporation Technical analysis New York Stock Exchange Taxation in the United States Financial markets Ownership Supply-side economics Economy of Chile J Sainsbury American International Group Insurance Gucci Annuity Surplus value Eircom RKO Pictures Productive and unproductive labour American Depositary Receipt Speculation Ford Motor Company Lehman Brothers Toronto-Dominion Bank Tesco Shareholder value Financial services Malcolm Glazer takeover of Manchester United Google Free trade Progressive tax Insider trading Poison pill Efficient market hypothesis History of the United States (1918-1945) Eugene Fama

why has my precious metals fund declined so much i thought their value could hold during uncertain times gold for example has been known to rise in price during times of fearfulness perhaps your precious metals fund is too well diversified and that's why it went down in value together with the whole market some precious metals such as platinum and paladium are mainly used in industry for production of goods and this means that these metals go down in price when the economy appears to be in trouble perhaps it's good to invest your money in gold in order to protect your money from inflation but people still believe that the banking system is secure and that's why they don't rush their money into gold when the economy is in trouble  Deflation (economics) Inflation Precious metal Gold Bretton Woods system Money Pound sterling Economy of Colombia Bank Keynesian economics Money supply Roman currency Monetarism Bond E-gold Economy of Romania Great Depression Fiat money Economy of Africa Banknote Mutual fund Economic history of Spain Interest Capital accumulation Monetary policy Devaluation Economy of Fiji Economy of the United States Economy of Papua New Guinea Economy of South Africa Commodity markets Mercantilism Supply-side economics Asian financial crisis Economy of Iceland Economy of Ghana PE ratio New Deal Say's law Gross domestic product History of the United States (1918-1945) Economy of Pakistan Economy of the Philippines Economy of Belgium Federal Reserve Economic relations of Japan Economics Economy of Peru Coin Economy of Nigeria Economy of Japan Economy of Brazil Economy of Hungary Economy of India Economy of Lebanon Economy of Sri Lanka Economy of Niger Economy of Argentina Economy of C__te d'Ivoire Economy of Greece Stock market Commodity money Economy of Indonesia Economy of the People's Republic of China Economy of Taiwan Political economy Surplus value Economy of Mali Labor theory of value Economy of Macau Economy of Saint Kitts and Nevis Investment bank Gresham's law Economy of Ukraine Economy of Guyana Economy of Mongolia Economy of Senegal Short selling Economy of Venezuela Economy of Chile Credit card Labour economics Euro Economy of Rwanda Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Health insurance Guild Economy of Haiti Economy of Albania Industrial Revolution Globalization Economy of Nicaragua

what do you think about the stock market plunge today when the market plunges it is scary fear takes over and eveyone starts selling and it just feeds on itself usually there is too much fear and people over react when you invest you have to understand there will be days like this and sometimes it takes months or years to get back to normal understanding this doesn't make it much less scary you should split your investments between a variety of stocks bonds and money market funds and not have money you will need within or years in the market if you do this it will still be scary but it won't affect your day to day living or short term plans finally if you are investing for the long term you want to buy when the market is low and sell high so a plunge like today is really a buying opportunity it would probably make sense to think about investing a little bit more than usual at this time that is the hardest thing to do we all feel confident when the market has been going up and then freeze or panic when it goes down actually we should be taking some profits when the market goes up and buy when it goes down because the shares are on sale this is all logic i know what to do and how to look at it but it is still very unsettling i try not to look at my investments at times like these since it might make me do something stupid  Mutual fund Short selling Gross domestic product Asian financial crisis Bond Stock market Gold as an investment PE ratio Economy of Russia Finance Arbitrage Security (finance) Hedge fund Wall Street Crash of 1929 Mergers and acquisitions Stock Life insurance Warren Buffett Annuity Monetary policy Deflation (economics) Keynesian economics Temasek Holdings Financial markets Institutional fund management Citigroup Dot-com Capital accumulation Day trading Asset Hyperinflation Debt Enron Corporation Microeconomics Capitalism Federal Reserve Financial services Economics MMORPG Privatization Yield curve Long-Term Capital Management Insurance Poker jargon James J.

do you think gordon ghekko's quote from the movie wal street is true read details money itself itself isn't lost or gained it's simply transferred from oner perception to another that was the quote i think it's true i mean think about it the only reason someone buys anything is becasue they perceive it to be a good deal as an example someone goes to target and buys something becasue they perceive it too be a good deal the money is than transferred to target and the profit is transfered to the share holders who bought the stock because they perceived it would go up or that they would make money and that it was a good deal that's basically investings waiting for people to perceive it as worth more is that right it's like that in anything the key to starting a corporation is to find a way to sell things people like and that people perceive are a good deal and then duplicate it like starbucks did opinoins on all this please yes in theory that is a fundamental of economic studies  Capital accumulation Capitalism Insurance Surplus value Gross domestic product Microeconomics Mutual fund Stock Hedge fund Mergers and acquisitions Political economy Bond Security (finance) Stock market Bank Corporation Ethical consumerism United Kingdom corporation tax Investment bank Finance Privatization Money Poker jargon Temasek Holdings Economy of Russia Anarchism and capitalism Exchange value Deflation (economics) Arbitrage Debt Hyperinflation Coercion Derivative (finance) Political corruption Ra (board game) Say's law Short selling Bretton Woods system Financial services Internet fraud Wal-Mart Warren Buffett Epistemology Call option PE ratio Keynesian economics Institutional fund management Supply and demand Intellectual property Insider trading Great Depression Option Life insurance Flat tax Supply-side economics Enron Corporation Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Starbucks Free trade Property (ownership right) Software patent debate James J.

why does the subprime trouble lead to the enormous fall of the i group what' s their correlation thanks banks in the us have for a long time been lending on the sub prime market this is generally mortgages to people who either cannot afford them or who have dreadful credit histories why do banks do this lending because they can charge much higher interest rates to cover the risk of default and defaults have been high what makes this worse is that other banks have bought a lot of this dodgy debt from other banks hoping to make a killing what has now happened is that the largest mortgage lender in the us is on the brink of bankruptcy and shares all across the market have gone down today for fear that others may follow where i come into this is that they are europe's largest private venture capital provider putting forward cash to fund management buyouts and mergers acquisitions the thing with i is that they have a habit of lending to those who are high risk and who are therefore 'sub prime ' their share price has dropped on wall street today taking them to a month low this is not in itself anything to worry about unless it keeps on falling the fear is that perhaps i may have some financial skeletons in their closet which are going to go pear shaped in the near future the sub prime market could happen here building societies have been lending up to six times a person's salary to fund the purchase of a house this is irresponsible lending and is technically 'sub prime' in its risk profile but because one does it the others follow or fall by the wayside financial probity goes out of the window there is a lurking suspicion in the city that some building societies are already technically insolvent this is because they do not actually have sufficient funds to cover themselves if interest rates zoom up and people start to leave the keys of their houses on the counter of the building society the societies have been borrowing huge amounts of money from international bankers and this money has got to be repaid when the nationwide took over the portman building society recently there did not seem to be any obvious benefit to the nationwide this started tongues wagging in city bars was it a government initiated bailing out job did the government want to keep everything on an even keel and not scare the horses so to speak like they did with the secondary banking crisis of the 's keep your eyes on the small building societies all is not well with the world economy the ecb has made thousand million euros available to banks to bail them out from sub prime trouble today yes today and no fewer than banks in europe have taken advantage of this cash to take loans to cover their big liabilities what's happening here in the uk is everything in the garden all rosy i do not think so beware  Financial markets Citigroup Finance Monetary policy Asian financial crisis Money Microcredit Great Depression Student loan Derivative (finance) Money supply Credit card Islamic banking Inflation Bretton Woods system Economy of Russia Central bank Insurance Corporate finance Government debt Gold standard Interest Mergers and acquisitions Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) History of the United States (1918-1945) Privatization Annuity Temasek Holdings Economy of Pakistan Short selling Arbitrage Microeconomics Life insurance Federal National Mortgage Association Free trade Usury Tax Stock Corporation Capitalism Mutual fund Hyperinflation Toronto-Dominion Bank Donald Trump Enron Corporation Mortgage-backed security Euro United Kingdom corporation tax Economy of Haiti Bank fraud Irish Life and Permanent Developing countries' debt Islamic economics Publicly funded medicine Ford Motor Company U.S. public debt Social Security (United States) Bank of China (Hong Kong) History of post-Soviet Russia Bank of America Debt levels and flows Flat tax Dot-com Federal Reserve Economy of Africa Income trust Arthur Laffer Yield curve Stock market Argentine Currency Board HSBC Wells Fargo Hedge fund Michael Milken Government National Mortgage Association Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Fiat money Gross domestic product New Deal Savings and loan association Surveillance Taxation in the United States Futures contract Economy of Romania High-yield debt Social Security debate (United States) PE ratio

is it a fact that s p index return this year so far is an annualized return is worse than putting the money in a month certificate of savings offered by some banks currently the s p is at it began the year at do the math and thats about as of right now of course its still only august so if this trend continued it would be maybe by year end ' still the main point is that historically teh stock market has gone up about per year give or take but this includes some years where its gone up or more and otehr years where it has gone down so you'll probably get a better return in the stock market long term but short term even medium term you may not gotta just hold and be patient when investing in stocks or if you can't handle the swings risk go ahead and get a cd  Bond Stock market Mutual fund Annuity Technical analysis Microsoft Yield curve Institutional fund management Hedge fund PE ratio Warren Buffett Financial markets Bank NASDAQ Interest Asian financial crisis Social Security debate (United States) Monetary policy Insurance Capital asset pricing model Income trust Deflation (economics) Hyperinflation Stock market index Investment bank Modern portfolio theory Arbitrage Life insurance Financial services Volatility Economy of Russia Mortgage Short selling Temasek Holdings Bank of China (Hong Kong) Capital accumulation Day trading Black-Scholes Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Dot-com Finance Credit card Economic history of the United States Stock exchange Eugene Fama Margin (finance) HSBC Derivative (finance) Philatelic investment Dow Jones Industrial Average Keynesian economics Supply-side economics Economy of Pakistan Equity investment Stock Venture capital Gold as an investment Money supply Foreign exchange market Berkshire Hathaway Mergers and acquisitions Long-Term Capital Management John Maynard Keynes Economy of India Option Privatization Certificate of deposit Corporation Debt Gross domestic product Passive management Enterprise content management Fixed income Behavioral finance Economy of Romania Inflation Personal finance Exchange-traded fund Treasury security Cost of capital Tesco Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Wall Street Crash of 1929 Risk management Closed-end fund Mad Money Rational expectations Citigroup National Kidney Foundation Singapore Joseph P.

how do i go about buying stocks and can i sell them at any time you can buy stocks in one second and literally sell them the next second but to do this you'll need a broker and or brokerage if you're new to this as it seems you are my advice is to go to your bank and see if they have an investments officer if they don't places like wachovia and bank of america do talk to that person about opening an investment account and ask if they have automatic investment systems where your money is automatically invested for you  Mutual fund Financial services Investment bank Wachovia Stock broker Finance Short selling Stock market Citigroup Mergers and acquisitions Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Foreign exchange market Warren Buffett Bank Eliot Spitzer Real estate broker Day trading ETrading Wells Fargo Money supply Financial analyst Annuity Toronto-Dominion Bank Security (finance) Insurance Federal Reserve Tesco Bond Temasek Holdings Financial markets Hedge fund Corporation NASDAQ Derivative (finance) Mad Money Personal finance Bank of America Berkshire Hathaway American Express Institutional fund management Life insurance Deflation (economics) Margin (finance) Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation PE ratio Stock trader Enron Corporation Certificate of deposit Sanford I.

is it impossible for someone to sell shares of a stock unless someone buys those shares i e is there never a time that a stock share is never owned other than perhaps during its ipo if there is a time when a share isn't owned then who holds it the exchange also if all shares are owned at any one moment what causes the price to change i'm not talking generally like earnings and growth i mean literally and specifically what causes the share price to change i always thought it was based on the amount of money people had invested in the stock but if all shares are always held how does the share price fluctuate if it's a bid for a stock at a certain price and people have to be willing to sell at that price why can't a put in a bid for a certain price i'm not talking about a limit order why do i have to wait until the share price gets to the price i want it to be that's a limit order right who or how is this price set thanks i've been scratching my head about this for awhile yes stocks are always owned by somebody in the very begining all the shares were owned by the company supply and demand if you go to wal mart to buy a sony playstation but they don't have any in stock then you can cross the street and go to target and if the have some in stock they will increase the price this is exactly the reason why sony playstation cost exactly the same everywhere on the other hand if sony sell its sony playstation for usd perhaps most people won't be willing to pay such a high price the price is not set by sony but by the users themselves if they don't buy the thing they will force sony to drop the prices on the other hand a cell phone costs usd but if everybody wants to buy your cell phone then you can sell it for as much as and this is exactly what keeps the price of the apple iphone high the price is not set by apple but by the users themselves if they don't buy the thing they will force apple to drop the prices if you need a more detailed answer about supply and demand then you can contact me right now an apple share is about usd let's pretend you hold shares of apple you can place an order to sell shares of apple at usd each but nobody is going to buy them this case is exactly like in the real world if you sell cars and you price a toyota corolla for usd then nobody will buy from you you can buy the same car at another dealership millions of shareholders are selling their shares of apple as we speak at usd and why would you pay for something you can buy elsewhere for the reverse is also true you can place in your computer an order to buy shares of aaple at usd each but who will sell their shares at such a low price that would be like going to a mercedes benz and offer for a car they won't sell you the car at that price  Stock Microeconomics Supply and demand Mutual fund Monopoly (game) Neopets Mergers and acquisitions Stock market Temasek Holdings MMORPG Wal-Mart PlayStation 3 PE ratio Capitalism IPod Warren Buffett Dividend Closed-end fund Asian financial crisis Short selling ITunes Music Store Gross domestic product Inflation Monetary policy Bond Microsoft Insurance Acorn Computers Airline Law of value Auction Foreign exchange market Economy of Russia Berkshire Hathaway Surplus value Day trading Citigroup Mac OS X PlayStation Portable Nintendo Tesco Digital photography SCO-Linux controversies Income trust Final Fantasy XI Dot-com Video game crash of 1983 Sega Apple Macintosh Exchange rate Google Steve Jobs RISC Hyperinflation Octopus card Corporation Keynesian economics Economy of India Ford Motor Company Internet fraud Best Buy Enron Corporation Gran Turismo (game) Apple Computer Intellectual property RuneScape economy Eircom Nintendo DS Corporate finance Supply-side economics Price discrimination Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Mikhail Khodorkovsky Bluetooth Gold as an investment PlayStation 2 Debt Atari Insider trading Just In Time Technical analysis Monopoly USB flash drive Gold standard NVIDIA Public transport Xbox 360 Taxation in the United States

would you sell a stock that went up in months it's a good solid year old company with a great future but no tangable reason for shooting up like this i'm afraid it'll take a tumble tough call you think place a stop loss order at and if your stock drops by then you still make a lot of money selling a winner is like selling tom cruise or leonardo dicaprio sure sometimes you may lose some money with one of their movies like narc i bet you did not see that one but in the long term you will always make billions with tom cruise  Short selling Poker jargon Deflation (economics) Bond Arbitrage Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Stock market Insurance PE ratio Mutual fund Derivative (finance) Leonardo DiCaprio Hyperinflation Time Warner Gambling Enron Corporation Craps Betting (poker) Sumner Redstone Toyota Prius Boeing Martin Scorsese Asian financial crisis Stock Gold as an investment Nintendo Warren Buffett Confidence trick Ra (board game) Financial markets Boogie Nights Hedge fund Steven Spielberg Margin (finance) Internet fraud PGA Tour Temasek Holdings Viacom MTV Movie Awards 1997 Gold standard Video game crash of 1983 The Open Championship Option Bet exchange Sears Holdings Corporation Capital accumulation Michael Mann (film director) Annuity Wyatt Earp Mad Money Revco Day trading Technical analysis Citigroup Dividend Toronto Blue Jays Employee stock option MTV Movie Awards 2005 Finance Opportunity cost 2000 Australian Grand Prix Spread betting Blackjack Just In Time Leslie Cheung Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor Long-Term Capital Management Warner Bros.

what does it mean by the fed injected liquidity into the market us govt printing more money afx news limited us fed reportedly injects bln usd to calm markets am et washington thomson financial the us federal reserve has reportedly injected bln usd into financial markets this morning higher than the bln usd markets had expected 'this in turn suggests that funding issues in the us are running near normal which also suggests that the funds rate will likely tend to move lower over the course of the session the market appears to be appreciating the benign implications with treasury prices now coming off the boil ' said kenneth logan at thomson ifr markets says there was no statement from the fed or indication of any to come but in the past it has said it would stand ready to inject liquidity if needed during periods of wall street turmoil well the government can always print more money but it does not simply print money and then dump it from the sky or place it evenly into commercial banks there has to be some mechanism for getting extra cash into the public's hands it accomplishes this by using open market operations look up that term and the term monetary policy on http www investopedia com interesting reading material basically the federal reserve bank has excess cash it keeps out of the system it will then release this cash into the system to increase the money supply to do this the federal reserve bank purchases treasury bonds from investors on the open market hence the name open market operations the fed receives these bonds and holds them inactive in return the fed transfers cash into the investor's bank accounts because the fed gas to pay for these bonds walla increased cash to the public the fed can run this operation in reverse sell their treasury bonds to the public and take back cash in exchange to decrease the money supply so the fed is able to use the free will of investors to influence the money supply the fed also has two other tools at its disposal to affect monetary policy it can change the discount rate as well as change the reserve requirement for commercial banks however the fed rarely messes with the reserve requirement and prefers to use open market operations and changes in the discount rate to facilitate its monetary policy the money supply and interest rates go hand in hand as the money supply expands money becomes more available and thus it is less costly to borrow it as the money supply shrinks money is scarce and more rare hence interest rates rise you can think of interest rates as the cost of borrowing money in other words it is more costly to borrow scarce money than abundant money  Finance Hyperinflation Keynesian economics Asian financial crisis Corporate finance Mortgage Security (finance) Debt Insurance Life insurance Mutual fund Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Arbitrage Privatization Stock Treasury security Annuity Argentine Currency Board Capitalism Arthur Laffer Financial markets Money creation Monetarism Economy of Nigeria Modern portfolio theory Economy of India Capital accumulation Tax Rational pricing Economy of Pakistan Repurchase agreement Pound sterling Free trade Economics Social Security (United States) Futures contract Citigroup Interest Say's law Short selling Mergers and acquisitions Fiat money Economy of Romania Student loan Exchange rate Temasek Holdings Derivative (finance) Carburetor Supply and demand Mortgage-backed security Octopus card Credit card Investment bank Nuclear power Capital asset pricing model Economy of the United States FairTax MMORPG Gold as an investment Publicly funded medicine Eugene Fama International Monetary Fund Reaganomics Deficit spending Foreign exchange market Economy of Africa Income trust Monopoly (game) Day trading Petroleum Bank of England United Kingdom corporation tax Federal National Mortgage Association PE ratio Hypoglycemia

difference between assurance and insurance i have assurance policy with a certain bank and it should matture in years now seven years time for us so can we cash it in in years time policy has been running years and matures in years time after years roxy is spot on you insure against an event that could happen insurance but for life assurance you are assured of a return at some point in the future bear in mind that there are also life insurance policies commonly referred to as protection in today's market by the sound of things you have an endowment assurance policy it will either pay out on death of the assured during the term of the policy or on survival to the maturity date endowment assurance policies accrue a value during their term so if you've been paying into your one for years it will most likely have a surrender value so technically you could cash it in now but before you do that you should seek advice from a financial adviser as cashing it in may not be the best option if it is a conventional with profits policy you might be able to sell it on the traded endowment market for a value that is greater than the current surrender value  Life insurance Insurance Annuity Bond Variable universal life insurance Rational pricing United Kingdom corporation tax Mutual fund Derivative (finance) Finance Treasury security Security (finance) Interest Trust (Law) USA Bretton Woods system Futures contract Bank Wal-Mart Prudential plc Financial markets Health insurance Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Universal life insurance Eliot Spitzer Monetary policy Term life insurance Blackjack Margin (finance) Yield curve Citigroup NASDAQ Personal finance Capitalism Asset Gambling Arbitrage Islamic banking Primerica Financial Services Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Deflation (economics) Political economy Black-Scholes Tax Predatory lending Unemployment Mortgage Intellectual property Stock PE ratio Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Year 2000 problem Euro Stock market Irish Life and Permanent Contract Great Depression Money Title insurance Model (economics) Venture capital Option Hyperinflation Trademark Enron Corporation Financial services Option style Advertising Fractional-reserve banking Donald Trump Microeconomics Public policy Warren Buffett Government debt Economy of Russia Forward contract Dot-com Social security Ponzi scheme Student loan Unemployment benefit Mutual assured destruction Asian financial crisis Copyright Lloyd's of London Agricultural policy Institutional fund management Pension Economy of the United States Debt Privatization Gold standard Investment bank Corporation Productive and unproductive labour Economics Hedge fund Collateralized debt obligation

how to get into stock market i am a beginner and needs to know some good companies out there also where to get started please investing in individual stocks takes a lot of knowledge and practice so i would not suggest doing this until you understand completely how the stock markets work vanguard com is ideal for long term investors who want to learn about mutual funds index funds and exchange traded funds etfs trading funds is less risky than trying to trade individual stocks unless you plan on spending everyday of your life looking at stock charts trying to determine the best time to get in and out of individual stocks i would look into some sort of fund also be very careful about asking for stock tips online most are probably worthless or contain unethical motives do not fall for any pump and dump scams as far as books go i actually started out with the investing for dummies books and they definitely pushed me in the right direction to many other books have their own agendas in my opinion the websites below all contain plenty of free information to get you started in the right direction  Mutual fund Bond S&P 500 Stock market Hedge fund Annuity Institutional fund management Derivative (finance) Financial services Free market Short selling Closed-end fund Investment bank Dow Jones Industrial Average Capitalism Economics Equity investment Corporate governance Eugene Fama Security (finance) Capital asset pricing model Stock exchange Capital accumulation Day trading Keynesian economics Gold as an investment Insurance Stock Income trust NASDAQ Supply-side economics Wall Street Crash of 1929 Asian financial crisis Microeconomics Finance Corporate finance Inflation Technical analysis Free trade The Vanguard Group Efficient market hypothesis Venture capital Index fund Warren Buffett Insider trading Intellectual property Dot-com Economy of Russia Enron Corporation New York Stock Exchange Foreign exchange market Trade Ethics Internet fraud Modern portfolio theory Mutual-fund scandal (2003) Morgan Stanley Social Security debate (United States) Advance fee fraud Citigroup Surplus value Long-Term Capital Management Arbitrage United Kingdom corporation tax Anarchism and capitalism Market capitalization Labor theory of value Debt Bank fraud Eliot Spitzer Ethical consumerism Philatelic investment Goldman Sachs Economy of Nigeria Lehman Brothers Open access Stock broker Contract bridge Individual Savings Account Mergers and acquisitions Anarchist economics London Stock Exchange MMORPG Microsoft Globalization Economy of Chile Corporation Economic relations of Japan Mad Money Economy of Iceland Temasek Holdings Extreme Programming Wal-Mart Economy of Romania Economy of Kuwait Passive management

so was these last couple of weeks the big market correction everyone was looking for or is there more since the dow on dropped from its high to the lowest point so far i don't think this qualifies as a big market correction thus it isn't what many prognosticators are predicting at least to this point on the other hand it probably was what many were looking for i suspect many investors got nervous and sold out there are a number of advisers who recommend cutting your losses at a certain this allows good stocks to be picked up at a discount my opinion is that we can expect corrections of this nature to occur once or twice a year when the big correction will come who knows  Dow Jones Industrial Average Technical analysis Mutual fund Bond Asian financial crisis Wall Street Crash of 1929 Stock market downturn of 2002 Wal-Mart Stock Dow Theory Capital asset pricing model Hedge fund October 27, 1997 mini-crash Arbitrage Annuity Billboard Hot 100 Economy of Russia Mergers and acquisitions Bowl Championship Series Theory of conduct Modern portfolio theory Supply-side economics Income statement Keynesian economics New York Stock Exchange ELO rating system Deflation (economics) Poker jargon Closed-end fund Eircom UK Singles Chart Insurance Warren Buffett Microeconomics Short selling Stock market index Enron Corporation September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for September Economics Mad Money Capitalism Temasek Holdings Intelligent design Spice Girls SAT Rational pricing Dow Jones & Company Great Depression Day trading Bull market Draw poker Operation Market Garden Gregorian calendar Debt Eugene Fama Sheepshead Kasparov versus The World Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gold standard Ra (board game) Closing milestones of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Free trade Arbitrage pricing theory Delta Goodrem Investment bank George W.

if dollar cost averaging is a good idea to buy is it a bad idea to sell if the buyer gains the person who regularly sells say k month of some mutual fund stock is probably doing the wrong thing perhaps he should be selling a fixed amount of shares units rather than dollars per month please help it's not strictly a zero sum game but on the other hand despite the other answer above it does not work to your advantage when selling most of the advantage of dollar cost averaging when buying is that when the price is low you buy more shares and when the price is high you buy less the matches up well with the classic buy low paradigm that everyone wants to do when you're selling if you sell a constant amount of dollars worth like you do when dollar cost averaging then you are selling more shares when the price is low and selling less when the price is high which is the opposite of what you should be doing anyway as a pragmatic issue it is easier to put in a sell order for shares then to sell for exactly dollars you can't actually do the latter the better idea is to have a pool of your money in cash or short term equivalents like money markets take your monthly cash disbursement out of that replenish it by selling shares when you judge them to be fairly priced or better  Arbitrage Monetary policy Bond Mortgage Supply and demand Inflation Economics Short selling Stock Gross domestic product PE ratio Day trading MMORPG Deflation (economics) Money supply Mergers and acquisitions Commodity Hyperinflation Stock market Rational pricing Dividend Financial markets Enron Corporation Annuity Keynesian economics Price discrimination Closed-end fund Capitalism Poker jargon Margin (finance) Security (finance) Bretton Woods system FairTax Insurance Wal-Mart Gold as an investment Warren Buffett Derivative (finance) Illegal drug trade Exchange-traded fund Futures contract Privatization Gold standard Surplus value Life insurance Temasek Holdings Islamic banking $ale of the Century Hedge fund Income trust Dot-com United States dollar American individualist anarchism SCO-Linux controversies Money Citigroup Prices of production Liberty Dollar Bank Bulk vending Internet fraud Labor theory of value Pound sterling Goodness and value theory Fiat money Asian financial crisis Corporate finance Monopoly (game) Supply-side economics Euro Gambling Canadian dollar Exchange value Public transport Call option Predatory lending Debt Law of value Finance Wealth U.S. public debt Arthur Laffer Equity investment RuneScape economy Intellectual property Price Exchange rate The Apprentice 2 Publicly funded medicine Trade

best way to start investing in the stock market great question it all depends on a number of factors such as how much are you starting with what are your goals for the money you plan to invest how do you feel about losing money in the short term these are just some of the questions you should ask yourself prior to investing based upon the amount of money you have and the answers to the other questions you might find that it s best not to invest in the stock market or perhaps you might find that it s best to hire a professional to assist you in either case mutual funds are a good starting points but which fund does require some work and quite frankly the work in choosing a fund itself can be somewhat overwhelming there are several sites books articles and answers etc on how to choose a mutual fund so i will spare you assuming you are comfortable with risk and your time horizon is long enough to help further reduce the risk then i recommend you shift your thinking a bit about investing in the stocks rather than seeing yourself investing in the stock market think of yourself as looking to purchase a company in other words see yourself as buying equity in a company and before you buy you are going to conduct your own due diligence on the company treat your purchase as if you were purchasing a home what s the true value are there any hidden problems how long would you like to own it this process will help to eliminate the speculation factor and it will help you develop a process for investing in companies versus trading in the stock market by the way do not underestimate your emotions once you re invested if after you ve gone through the process and you find that you are unable to sleep at night or your investment is not what you thought when you bought then perhaps you should move on to something that allows you to feel more comfortable and get some sleep good luck  Mutual fund Stock market Hedge fund Insurance Bond Mergers and acquisitions Annuity Institutional fund management Finance Microeconomics Life insurance Investment bank Free trade Keynesian economics Security (finance) Short selling Corporate finance Stock Deflation (economics) Labor theory of value Derivative (finance) Corporate governance Income trust Monetary policy Bretton Woods system Personal finance Capital accumulation Supply and demand Capitalism Economics Labour economics Social Security debate (United States) Bank Financial markets Economy of Russia Stock broker Privatization Debt Extreme Programming Marshall Plan Arbitrage Mortgage Corporation Gold as an investment Inflation Citigroup Great Depression Option Surplus value Stock market index Model (economics) Monetarism Gross domestic product Equity investment Anarchism and capitalism Margin (finance) Primerica Financial Services Real estate economics Financial services Trust (Law) USA Ethical consumerism Foreign exchange market Commodity markets Modern portfolio theory Speculation Exchange-traded fund Health insurance CPU design Risk management Futures contract $ale of the Century Private equity Variable universal life insurance Temasek Holdings Cancer Intellectual property Economy of Nigeria Warren Buffett FairTax Berkshire Hathaway Productive and unproductive labour Breastfeeding Morgan Stanley Economy of India Abortion Individual Savings Account Natural monopoly Cold War Supply-side economics Technical analysis Risk Prices of production Monopoly (game) Eugene Fama

how do i buy stock from a german company i want to buy stock from a company in germany i don't know much about this stuff and don't have a portfolio either just starting out i dont need advice on why i should be buying american please thanks do an internet search for the company name followed by adr adr stands for american depository receipt and is a way that some foreign companies list their stock for sale here if they don't list then you have to consider whether the stock is liquid enough enough recurring sales trading so that you'll be able to get out of it should circumstances change many companies also offer direct purchase of their shares through a drip dividend re investment plan where you can acquire shares without opening a brokerage account this is a vastly underutilized tool for long term investors and one i would seek out in any event typically you can email investor relations at the company for details  Mutual fund Arbitrage American Depositary Receipt Stock Warren Buffett Short selling Security (finance) Financial markets Stock market Day trading Temasek Holdings United Kingdom corporation tax Corporate finance Investment bank PE ratio Hedge fund Enron Corporation NASDAQ Citigroup Finance Corporation Bond Dot-com Mergers and acquisitions Stock broker Dividend Berkshire Hathaway Google Equity investment Foreign exchange market Tesco Annuity Gold as an investment Financial services Black-Scholes Closed-end fund Microsoft Sears Holdings Corporation Bank Privatization HSBC Derivative (finance) Institutional fund management Conglomerate (company) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Income trust Economy of Nigeria Great Depression Gazprom Excite Venture capital Wachovia Toronto-Dominion Bank Eliot Spitzer Mortgage Mad Money Capital accumulation American Express Harken Energy Scandal Long-Term Capital Management Monetary policy Michael Milken Money supply Futures contract Advance fee fraud Insider trading CBS J Sainsbury Bretton Woods system Margin (finance) The South Sea Company Ford Motor Company Wells Fargo Timeline of the Enron scandal Auction Modern portfolio theory Neopets Stock market index Financial analyst American Motors Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Economy of Bolivia Debt Takeover Real estate broker Lehman Brothers Best Buy Technical analysis Market capitalization Economic relations of Japan Asian financial crisis United Parcel Service Wall Street

what happened to our economy and the us dollar i guess i haven't been paying attention but i just went to google to convert dollars into uk pounds and it came out to x when did that happen last time i checked which admittedly was ages ago i thought pounds were only about x the dollar how long has the dollar been losing value months years despite the people who answered that is the war or something else that has no effect on the currency the answer is simple the fed refuses to raise interest rates for inflation fears and since our inflation rate is so low you can't make any good money at such low interest this is not uncommon and it goes in cycles war has nothing to do with it it is banking and it is that simple all other factors are knee jerk reactions the dollar was at to with the pound in when we had no war it is the never ending cycle of the fed trying to keep prices down while stabaizing the dollar not easy to do  Inflation Hyperinflation Deflation (economics) Monetary policy Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Gold standard United States dollar Fiat money Pound sterling Asian financial crisis Supply-side economics Money supply Bond Yield curve Keynesian economics Currency Interest Argentine Currency Board Money Gross domestic product Australian dollar Reaganomics Exchange rate Bretton Woods system Microeconomics Economy of the United States U.S. public debt Government debt Business cycle Federal Reserve Wheel of Fortune Supply and demand Progressive tax Gold as an investment Renminbi FairTax Canadian dollar Monetarism Economy of Pakistan Economy of Cuba PE ratio Arbitrage Central bank Phillips curve Say's law Capital accumulation CPU cache Taxation in the United States Labor theory of value Model (economics) Economics Hard currency Argentine peso Economy of Suriname Bank MMORPG Economy of Venezuela Liberty Dollar New Zealand dollar Hydrogen economy Consumer price index Economic history of Spain Economy of Africa Economy of India Legal tender Privatization Stagflation Economy of Ecuador Economy of Chile History of the United States (1980-1988) Black Wednesday Macroeconomics Wealth Foreign exchange market Rational expectations ISO 4217 Social Credit Marshall Plan Austrian School Economy of the Philippines Eurodollars Great Depression Real (currency) Surplus value Ringgit 1973 oil crisis Economy of Zambia Economy of South America Eurozone Flat tax Economy of Lebanon Space Shuttle program Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

when trading stocks what's the benefit of a stop limit order over a limit order if a stop order trades at a trigger price and a limit order trades at a trigger price what's the benifit of a stop limit order let me explain in layman's terms both limit order and stop limit order are the same stop order and stop limit order are different i'll assume you mean the latter stop order is a market order meaning that the stock will be bought or sold at the current market price this order will be executed when the price is reached stop limit buy limit sell limit are triggered at the price you want the key difference is that limit orders are limit price or better for instance if you set a buy limit at the order will trigger at and a trade at or below would execute the order limit orders have the potential of not being filled because the price could jump around so much i e triggered at but then jumps to above and stays there your order would not be filled because the or better has not been reached hope this helps ron chfc  Short selling Stock market Arbitrage Supply and demand Gross domestic product Investment bank Bond Stock Technical analysis Margin (finance) Economics Insurance Day trading Mutual fund Monetary policy The South Sea Company Euro Option Hedge fund Wal-Mart Free trade Warren Buffett Microeconomics Black-Scholes Economic calculation problem Enron Corporation Monopoly (game) Sears Holdings Corporation New York Stock Exchange Labor theory of value Economic growth Foreign exchange market Dot-com Trade Political economy PE ratio Asian financial crisis Commodity Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Deflation (economics) Life insurance Closed-end fund Rational pricing Marketing Capitalism Stock broker Long-Term Capital Management Mergers and acquisitions Insider trading Free market Annuity Corporation Bretton Woods system Financial markets Capital accumulation Anarchism and capitalism Common Agricultural Policy Beretta 92F/FS Monopoly Ra (board game) Commodity markets United Kingdom corporation tax Wall Street Crash of 1929 Citigroup First-sale doctrine Gold standard Eircom Surplus value Employee stock option Emergence Auction Video game crash of 1983 Computer virus Tesco Publicly funded medicine Exchange value Joseph P.

can bear sterns hedge funds buy stock in bear sterns stock i heard on the news bear sterns has hedge funds can the managers of the hedge fund buy stock in bear sterns hedge funds are pooled investment vehicles run by managers so when you heard that bear sterns owned hedge funds that means that either a the entity that was a manager of a fund was owned by bear sterns or b the managers were just directly bear sterns employees each hedge fund is different and governed by rules that the particular hedge fund sets out in its organizational documents and describes in the ppm it gives its investors most hedge funds do say that they've got the freedom to trade in affiliated securities so my bet is that any bear sterns hedge fund would be allowed to invest in bear sterns however if the managers invested in bear sterns to prop up bear sterns stock price that would be a breach of fiduciary duty most hedge funds disavow almost all fiduciary duties but assuming you could prove that even delaware chancery court would find that an unwaivable breach i suspect though that you've been hearing about the failing bear sterns funds and those are not equity funds primarily but funds that invested heavily in clos and cdos which are a sort of structured bond trust that takes pools of debt and then sells different rated bonds from them which are collateralized by the underlying pool of debt and loans and the cash flow from them hence the term collateralized loan obligation clo or collateralized debt obligation cdo these structured debt instruments have been crazy hot for the last years but now are biting us in the ass because it turns out that a lot of th residential mortgages that some clo and cdo managers have used to build their collateral pools are junk search using www yahoo com search  Derivative (finance) Stock Mortgage Mutual fund Security (finance) Finance Credit derivative Federal National Mortgage Association Short selling Corporation Corporate finance Stock market Debt Insurance Financial markets Annuity Mortgage-backed security Investment bank Mergers and acquisitions Securitization Arbitrage Monetary policy Bretton Woods system Citigroup Income trust Gold as an investment Long-Term Capital Management Corporate governance Predatory lending Financial services Government debt Venture capital Margin (finance) United Kingdom corporation tax Temasek Holdings Trust (Law) USA Interest Goldman Sachs Capital accumulation Federal Reserve Option Eliot Spitzer Economy of Russia Futures contract Life insurance Asian financial crisis SCO-Linux controversies U.S. public debt Donald Trump Hedge (finance) Equity investment Economy of Chile Institutional fund management Berkshire Hathaway Municipal bond Michael Milken Pension Primerica Financial Services Short (finance) PE ratio Lloyd's of London Gold standard Hyperinflation Enron Corporation High-yield debt Capitalism Bank fraud Warren Buffett Closed-end fund Government National Mortgage Association Central bank Social Security (United States) Deflation (economics) Rational pricing Poker jargon Collateralized mortgage obligation Great Depression Wall Street Crash of 1929 Money supply Conflict of interest Taxation in the United States Ford Motor Company Social Security debate (United States) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Treasury security International Monetary Fund Eugene Fama Stock market index Bank of China (Hong Kong) Lehman Brothers Toronto-Dominion Bank Speculation Economy of Nigeria Contract Individual Savings Account Dot-com

what does all this volatility in the stock market mean is our world facing an all encompassing depression globalists like the bush family love communism the love china too the us economy may tank next week because bush's policies have failed and you want to talk about liberals are communists take a look at what hard working republicans are saying about what is going on the destruction of the united states may continue if the financial markets teeter or crash next week i believe that the plan is to weaken the united states until the american people capitulate and allow the globalists to do what they want which is the destruction of the u s constitution disarming the average citizen collapse of the us economy collapse of the us borders collapse of american confidence the electorate confused with propaganda and slanted media destruction of the american middle class unfortunately there are fears out there that our economy could tank next week the fed had to prop up the stock market three times friday with billions of dollars monday could be a bear fed orders trillion dollars printed put in circulation three separate sources in the u s treasury have told me that this week the federal reserve ordered two trillion dollars to be printed the u s treasury is allegedly running printing presses to accommodate that order treasury employees were specifically ordered not to talk about this to anyone because it could cause economic collapse central banks on both sides of the atlantic pumped billions into the financial system to calm nerves over an impending credit crunch yesterday but their actions only served to heighten alarm leading to a fresh plunge in global share prices the fading dollar can be held responsible for our troubles it isn't the dollar's fault because it is merely a piece of paper which is un backed and the product of a printing press it is those who administer and spend it recklessly who have caused its demise and who are wrecking our economy and nation what repercussions does a dollar debasement have remember it is in no way the fault of the citizenry it is totally the fault of government and the d c gang all of us are merely the victims thank you mr bush every passing day this new world order this so called free trade is eroding years of the hard won gains for american small business and employees but very few people seem to care how effective the propaganda has been americans don't know who they are anymore what do american citizens do next give up or fight  Bretton Woods system Gold standard Great Depression Money supply Economy of the United States History of the United States (1918-1945) Economy of Russia New Deal Inflation Asian financial crisis Arthur Laffer Economic history of the United States Monetary policy Citigroup Supply-side economics U.S. public debt History of post-Soviet Russia Federal Reserve United States dollar Capital accumulation Economy of Pakistan Wal-Mart FairTax Economy of El Salvador Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Enron Corporation Monetarism Democracy Government debt Kyoto Protocol Social Security debate (United States) Temasek Holdings Money Social Security (United States) History of the United States History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991) Fiat money Reaganomics Marshall Plan Economy of Chile Euro 9/11 conspiracy theories Economy of the People's Republic of China 2004 Republican National Convention Trade Origins of the American Civil War Free trade Pakistan Pound sterling Economy of Romania Keynesian economics Gold as an investment World economy Economy of Nigeria September 11, 2001 attacks Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economy of Europe Hurricane Katrina timeline U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Tariff Russian constitutional crisis of 1993 Bank Argentine Currency Board Franklin D.

stocks question i really want to invest in stock but i guess i just don't understand the idea of it yet what is the point in buying stock how do i know how much my stock is worth i really don't actually have that money until i sell the stock right i mean i can't just take some money out as if it was an atm right how do i know how much i will sell it for any basic information you can give me would help a lot i'm trying to learn but it's kinda hard to find information in words that i can understand people make money from dividends and selling stocks based on inflation and emotions you would want to buy stock when you have taken these things into account and are willing to risk your stock investment in return for a greater return on your money most companies pay no regular dividends and those that do pay very little like interest on a bank account the reason you would rather own stock than a bank account is you are expecting a greater return based on a greater risk of losing some or all of your investment in the stock market than with a bank account generally those companies that pay regular dividends are earning the market's confidence that they continue to pile up so much cash they have to give it away so if you invest in them for years and then sell you can make profit both on the dividends and the gain in value when you sell this is a sound way of making money in the stock market by inflation i mean regular inflation of wages and prices of stuff you buy that also raises the value of everything up the ladder including businesses in the stock market i also mean inflation that comes from a population that continues to grow and finds it easy and more tax advantaged to buy stock such as through k's and ira's also look at the dates of the mutual funds on your k offering and see if you can find any that were around during wwii this theory suggests you can expect some overall growth in the stock market over time some will go up some will go down be sure to diversify by buying more than one mutual fund and make sure they are in different categories so you will have some that go up to go along with those that will go down so overall your investment will grow over time notice i said mutual fund obviously you are a novice and therefore should buy mutual funds now stocks once you feel comfortable with a broker or advisory newsletter and avoid commodities and options because those are so risky with less ownership than stock and are therefore more gambling than investment much more money is probably made or lost on emotions one example is the stock market changing based on some economic data that makes sense then people continue buying and selling because they are emotionally attached to the trend have you ever played a car race video game where you are racing along faster than you should and when you come upon a curve you start to slide you get worried about crashing so you counter steer but you over corrected so you steer back the over way and discover you over corrected again the stock market has thousands of people doing the same thing every day they are going too fast the market corrects they worry about a crash and they over correct people are buying and selling based on the emotional sales pitch of a broker k enrollment relative friend email or ad look at how many answers suggested specific companies to buy or brokers to use one of them stated her affiliation to her recommendation the others did not state their affiliation they might be brokers or they might just be happy customers i advise you to steer clear of specific recommendations do an internet search or a review of a k listing and pick out mutual funds that have good track records good track records do not bring guarantees of future success but if the yankees have been to the playoffs more than the devil rays in recent years which team do you think has the better chance this year also only look at years so you don't get a fluke and you don't get a past perennial that has not done so good recently also if a mutual fund did well over years the fund manager may have retired been promoted or lured to another company for higher pay so stick to a year measurement stock is easily measured by the stock market and reported in the daily papers and the internet it is not like a car art rare coins antiques and real estate you always know what stocks are worth expect to lose a little when you sell stock just like everything else the person buying or selling wants an incentive and there are usually transaction costs too so if you see xyz stock is trading at and you have you might want to buy shares but the person who owns it would offer it for sale at and the broker wants for handling the transaction so you would only wind up with shares now worth apiece for a total of if you think you want to sell them somebody might offer you apiece for them and the broker will want another so if you sell them the broker will return to you so you would have paid and got back close to what the stock was worth you also would have lost only because you did not let it sit long enough for others to keep bidding up the price it was only affected by your activity that raised and lowered the price you do not have that cash readily available like withdrawing it from an atm since you would lose a little every time you buy or sell like i explained above it should not be fluctuating with withdrawals your investing strategy should be an expectation of keeping that stock in there for at least a year you could use your k where your employer pays all those transaction costs and the money is deducted before tax is calculated so you can afford to invest more than if it had been taxed if the rate coming out of your check is too much then you can adjust it or even stop it all together until you can add to it again in the meantime you should not withdraw from it but can sometimes borrow against it if you really need to and can afford to pay it back on a regular basis keep in mind that process usually charges you transaction costs you did not ask the hardest question of all when to buy and when to sell that is very hard to answer but you need to know something about that too basically you should buy based on meaningful statistics you should not buy based on proforma projections or forecasts those are not statistics but guesses and marketing ploys meaningful is hard to define one statistic is not enough to be meaningful recent profits are the best measure unless there is a pending investigation by the sec irs fda or other governmental entity comparing profit earnings pe ratios to other companies in their industry is a great tool but is not the best when the whole industry say technology is overpriced the other top measure relates to cash such as debt to equity ratio the drawback to this is some companies like tobacco have great cash ratios but may not be the sound investment for the future so get more than one measure from the internet maybe stick to a rule like each of the above net income p e recent news debt equity must compare favorably to competitor and to the market as a whole to compare to the market as a whole you might research the brand names of the stuff you buy the stores you visit and the restaurants you enjoy and use a few of them as benchmarks you might even find that company that gets so much of your business is a good stock buy just ripe for the stock market to go wild about the last thing is you should sell the stock or mutual fund when you no longer would want to buy it if you had the money to invest for instance you would sell if the measure you used for buying the mutual fund is now below average or the great p e ratio is too high or a meaning they lost money and there is no profit

what is online forex trading about all i can find on search is always a bit too complicated for me to unders forex com is mainly involved with trading curencies from around the world this is not a good place to learn about investing you might be better off starting with something like mutual funds it afford you the opportunity to get into the markets without investing too much money all at once and allows you to test the waters at a risk level you can choose depending on the type of fund risk can be minimal bond funds low to medium balanced dividend etc or high risk equity resource foreign etc start by talking to your bank or reputable fund management company but by all means take your time it's best to understand what you're getting into rather than blindly jumping in learning to invest is an ongoing process if you start by identifying what your long and short term goals are you'll be better able to decide how to approach the process have fun with it it's a great experience  Mutual fund Corporate finance Finance Hedge fund Monetary policy Debt Foreign exchange market Investment bank Bond Bank Capital accumulation Stock market Institutional fund management Asset Short selling Free trade Mergers and acquisitions Insurance Microeconomics Keynesian economics Annuity Financial markets Income trust Bretton Woods system Mortgage PE ratio Eugene Fama Life insurance Collateralized debt obligation Education in the People's Republic of China Strategic management Capitalism Risk management Cost of capital Economy of Russia Variable universal life insurance Financial services Derivative (finance) Prostate cancer Long-Term Capital Management Deflation (economics) Economy of India Information Services Procurement Library Goldman Sachs Primerica Financial Services Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Credit card Government debt Interest Economy of Chile Microcredit Futures contract Toronto-Dominion Bank NASDAQ Citigroup Supply and demand Economy of Africa Extreme Programming Divorce Globalization Asian financial crisis Commodity markets Economy of Pakistan Gross domestic product United States dollar Anarchism and capitalism Yield curve Comprehensive Program for Socialist Economic Integration Microsoft Exchange-traded fund Hypoglycemia Corporate governance Economy of Iceland Investment Arbitrage Islamic banking Management information system Marshall Plan Money supply Intellectual property Human sexual behavior Pension Nuclear power Private equity Behavioral finance Social Security debate (United States) Economy of Nigeria

are dividends yield measured annually for example pepsico div yield according to yahoo finance is is that paid quarterly or is the for the whole year if for the whole year why would i invest in this stock when i could invest in a cd or mutual fund that pays more than return annually any help would be appreicated yes the div and the yield is an annual amount the part you are forgetting here is that the real reason you are buying the stock is for the capital appreciation you want the stock itself to go up in value a cd certainly wont do that please also note that dividends and the amount that the stock goes up in value if you hold it for more than year is tax advantaged and is taxed at the interest you earn on a cd is taxed at your normal income rate as for the mutual fund that returns a higher rate that is always something you can consider although the taxes can be more complicated there depending on how they sell stocks during the year they can really throw you off by buying and selling stocks in less than a year  Mutual fund Bond Annuity PE ratio Income trust Taxation in the United States United Kingdom corporation tax Microeconomics Insurance 401(k) Surplus value Life insurance Income tax Cost of capital Gross domestic product Warren Buffett Derivative (finance) Capital accumulation Economy of Russia Flat tax Stock Citigroup Equity investment Social Security (United States) Individual Savings Account Eugene Fama Investment bank Corporation Security (finance) Black-Scholes Rational pricing Lloyd's of London Progressive tax Bretton Woods system Supply-side economics Income Federal Reserve Capital gains tax Wealth condensation Fixed income Finance Free trade FairTax Mortgage Financial markets Yield curve Islamic banking Income statement Debt Hyperinflation Dividend imputation Short selling Measures of national income and output Mergers and acquisitions Money supply Anarchism and capitalism Inflation Productive and unproductive labour Exchange-traded fund Futures contract Economic rent Economy of Pakistan Treasury security Gold standard Capital asset pricing model Technical analysis Keynesian economics Economy of Chile Supply and demand Conglomerate (company) Social Security debate (United States) Airline Dot-com Financial services Student loan Gold as an investment Municipal bond Retirement plan Michael Milken Berkshire Hathaway Stock market Ponzi scheme Monopoly (game) Tax haven Collateralized debt obligation Compensation of employees Labor theory of value

if most people are making gains on the stock market where is the money coming from say the stock markets double in value over a year where does the money come from who is losing money it's a hypothetical question similarly if the stock markets crash big time where does the money go who is making big gains when the markets flatline this is kind of a strange question to ask if you know how the stock market works it doesn't make sense because there is no real money being lost if the stock market doubles in value in the market you don't have to have a loser to get a winner it's difficult to explain if you buy the share at and someone is willing to buy it for you have made but that doesn't mean the person who bought it lost since he now owns something that other people are willing to buy at if something happened so that others were no longer willing to pay but only then the person owning the stock would have theoretically lost  Mutual fund Warren Buffett Capital accumulation Stock Short selling Corporation PE ratio Surplus value Stock market Option Microeconomics Mad Money Financial markets Dot-com Monopoly (game) Citigroup Supply-side economics Annuity Economics Finance Wall Street Crash of 1929 Enron Corporation Theory of conduct Law of value Dividend Privatization Blackjack Gross domestic product Life insurance Arbitrage Gambling Bond Call option Institutional fund management Insider trading Great Depression World Series Internet fraud Wheel of Fortune MMORPG Poker jargon Fixed income Day trading Derivative (finance) Hyperinflation Mergers and acquisitions Neopets Labor theory of value Speculation Asian financial crisis Socialism Money Technical analysis Money supply Sears Holdings Corporation Security (finance) Association of Tennis Professionals Federal Reserve Temasek Holdings Surplus product Video game crash of 1983 Capitalism Joseph P.

what are the pros and cons of savings bonds and how do they work i'm thinking of purchasing to save for the future different types of savings bonds but the most typical one is the ee bond you purchase it for half the face value bond you purchase it for hold it for however long time period you want they stop earning interest after years you can cash it in although if you cash it in within the first years you lose a certain amount of interest when you cash them in you get what they are worth at that point in time and at the end of the year will get a int from whatever bank you cashed them in at you have two choices on how to handle the interest from savings bonds you can either wait until you cash them in or declare the interest that the bonds have accrued during the year for that years interest the change in value from one year to the next is the interest pros are that they are a safe investment and don't do too bad with interest rate cons are that because they are a safe investment you don't expect to make a lot of money in them unlike the stock market you can also use savings bonds for education purposes and if you meet all the requirements the interest is not taxable when you cash the bonds in  Bond Mutual fund Life insurance Interest Insurance Bank Annuity Deflation (economics) Social Security debate (United States) Municipal bond Monetary policy Yield curve Hyperinflation 401(k) Social Security (United States) Debt Variable universal life insurance PE ratio Inflation Money supply Personal finance FairTax Money Tax Zero coupon bond Keynesian economics Corporate finance Dividend Modern portfolio theory Mergers and acquisitions Mortgage Arbitrage Hedge fund Stock Income trust Investment bank Collateralized debt obligation Pension Economy of Russia Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Individual Savings Account Credit card Derivative (finance) Corporation United Kingdom corporation tax Citigroup Temasek Holdings Fixed income Taxation in the United States The Joker's Wild The Amazing Race Trust (Law) USA Valuation (finance) Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Warren Buffett Bank fraud Government debt Futures contract Ra (board game) Money creation Gold standard Rational pricing Option style Federal Reserve Capital asset pricing model Progressive tax Eugene Fama Retirement plan Euro Winning Streak Islamic banking Michael Milken Short selling Student loan Berkshire Hathaway The South Sea Company United States dollar Central bank Economy of Chile Internet fraud Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Asset Energy development Gold as an investment Dot-com Investment Capital gains tax

does your success at the stock market depend on how well the business you invest in does i heard one person explain that the worse your company does the more money you make is this true or is it the other way around it depends what decisions you make if you buy the stock then obviously you'll make money if the company does well if you sell short then you'll make money while the company falls apart yes this is possible you can make money both ways you just have to know which way the stock is going to go first you have to decide whether the company will be successful or failure if you think it will be a success then buy it if you think it will be a failure then sell short or buy put options selling short and trading options is riskier than just buying the stock but if you understand what you're doing the rewards can be quicker and greater someone asked earlier what is short selling and how does it work you may want to read my answer http answers yahoo com question index ylt arowo ghbwp e uw vcll bty ix qid aaf plh show profile info aa some people buy the stock and buy insurance the insurance is a put option the put option is like a bet or a lottery ticket it can become extremely valuable if the stock goes down but it expires worthless if the stock goes up so if your stock goes up you paid for the insurance and you didn't need it but if your stock goes down and you lose money then your ticket is a winner and you win a lot of money if you did everything right then the amount of money you win is more than the amount you lost in the stock so it doesn't matter which way the stock goes if it goes up you make money if it goes down you make money now if you don't buy the stock but you buy the put option then what happens if the stock goes up the option is worthless if the stock goes down within a certain time then you can sell the put option and make a lot of money you make money only if the stock goes down if the stock goes up you lose the amount of money you paid for the insurance so the worse the company does the more money you make note buying put options insurance and selling short are two totally different things  Option Derivative (finance) Annuity Bond Insurance Microeconomics Blackjack Poker jargon PE ratio Mutual fund Stock Gambling Stock market Security (finance) Dot-com Warren Buffett Citigroup Capitalism Contract Arbitrage Finance Lottery Corporation Day trading Internet fraud Wheel of Fortune Capital accumulation Fixed income Mad Money Economics Put option Financial markets Taxation in the United States Option style Short selling Labor theory of value The Amazing Race Theory of conduct Hyperinflation Enron Corporation Privatization Investment bank Betting (poker) Surplus value Hedge fund Corporate finance Employee stock option Gold as an investment Call option American International Group Monopoly (game) Confidence trick Incentive Labour economics Margin (finance) $ale of the Century 401(k) Income trust Health insurance Auto insurance Say's law Money Philatelic investment Donald Trump Sears Holdings Corporation Wal-Mart Deflation (economics) Make money fast Animal Crossing Institutional fund management Harken Energy Scandal Microsoft Dow Jones Industrial Average Craps Ra (board game) Monetary policy Halliburton Rational pricing Asian financial crisis Bank fraud Black-Scholes Publicly funded medicine Great Depression Baccarat Risk management Prediction market Air New Zealand Political economy Wall Street Crash of 1929 Mergers and acquisitions

why finance stocks are going down i herd that subrime what is this bank giving mortgage below prime rate why is there house price is high why less buyer and more seller any affect on bank earning sub prime is a term which refers to high risk debtors ie people with bad credit low credit or low income high risk when the housing market was booming for the past few years interest rates were low and credit was real cheap institutional lenders were getting very lax with who they were lending money to and they sold many adujustable rate mortgages to subprime debtors well the introductory fixed rate was all well and good and the housing market was robust so prices were rising and people continued to buy but interest rates began to rise and the low introductory fixed rate expired and the interest payments adjusted to reflect higher market rates subprime debtors found out they couldnt afford to pay the mortgage so they began selling and selling and selling alot of people bought houses not to live in but to cash in on the housing boom and as soon as they started to see a lot of selling they wanted out too so they began selling and selling and selling so now everyone is defaulting on banks who offered subprime loans and many of these banks borrow money to offer loans with so what you have is everyone borrowing money from each other now everyone is asking for their money back but because no one has the money to pay off their loans there's a liquidity crisis so basically its all a wicked chain reaction and that's whats causing the stock market to slump  Islamic banking Bank Predatory lending Finance Monetary policy Derivative (finance) Financial markets Inflation Student loan Interest Gold standard Mortgage-backed security Real estate bubble Arbitrage Asian financial crisis Interest rate Insurance Stock Mutual fund Government National Mortgage Association Credit card Security (finance) Short selling Federal National Mortgage Association Annuity Money supply Corporate finance Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Central bank Microeconomics Bretton Woods system Government debt Futures contract Supply and demand Usury Citigroup Federal Reserve Great Depression Real estate broker Stock market Economy of Pakistan Savings and loan association Capitalism Donald Trump Life insurance Option Credit derivative PE ratio Economy of the United States Fractional-reserve banking History of the United States (1918-1945) Savings and Loan crisis Yield curve Consumer finance Rational pricing Investment bank Repurchase agreement Keynesian economics History of post-Soviet Russia Dot-com Fixed income Primerica Financial Services Mergers and acquisitions Islamic economics Gross domestic product Microcredit Taxation in the United States Economy of India Internet fraud Collateralized debt obligation Subsidy Day trading Debt consolidation Babylonian law Surplus value Personal finance Income trust Money market Argentine Currency Board Dividend Call option Lender of last resort Temasek Holdings Margin (finance)

what are the different ways i can invest my money you should invest in stocks bonds and money market funds you want to buy a diversified portfolio of stocks as individual stocks are too risky for most folks this means buying mutual funds i like vanguard com other people like fidelity tiaa cref and dfa buy no load low cost funds if you are like most people you will invest part of your money aggressively in stock funds and part conservatively in money market funds and bond funds vanguard com has an on line questionnaire which will give you an idea how aggressive you want to be if your company offers a k plan at work try to invest the most you can the money grows tax free and some companies will match your contribution investing in a mutual fund ira is also a good idea if you have children you may want to consider a plan or other college savings plan that grows tax free i like index funds because of their broad diversification you are less likely to have a dramatic drop in value they also have the lowest expenses for stock funds i would suggest putting of your money in the vanguard total stock market index fund and in a foreign stock index fund however there are many different opinions out there on what the best mutual funds are read the links below and form your own opinion buying a house instead of renting will save you a lot of money in the long run you don't have to pay rent and you build equity in your house instead buying rental property can also be a good investment however being a landlord can be hard work and many people are not good at it if you don't know how to handle deadbeat renters you can have trouble if you have high interest debt like credit cards it is best to pay this off first before trying most of the investment ideas above you should also have months of salary saved up as an emergency fund in a bank or money market fund before trying more risky investments believing advice you get on yahoo answers can be risky so read these websites for further information if you find it too confusing contact a professional financial advisor they will charge you significant commissions however sources http www vanguard com vgapp hnw planningeducation http www fool com school htm http www dallasnews com sharedcontent dws bus scottburns columns vitindex html http sec gov investor pubs assetallocation htm https flagship vanguard com vgapp hnw fundsinvquestionnaire cbdinittransurl https a flagship vanguard com vgapp hnw planningeducation education  Institutional fund management Hedge fund Financial services Annuity Security (finance) Stock Investment bank Finance Economy of Russia Stock market Social Security debate (United States) Income trust Equity investment Mortgage Insurance Capital asset pricing model Debt Citigroup Capitalism Mergers and acquisitions Deflation (economics) PE ratio Keynesian economics Modern portfolio theory Warren Buffett Hyperinflation Individual Savings Account Inflation Economy of Chile Taxation in the United States Temasek Holdings Corporation Microeconomics 401(k) Eugene Fama Gold as an investment Primerica Financial Services Life insurance Short selling Bank Economy of India Asian financial crisis Index fund Student loan History of the United States (1918-1945) Mad Money Venture capital Gross domestic product Interest Anarchism and capitalism Toronto-Dominion Bank Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Supply-side economics FairTax Social Security (United States) Microcredit Michael Milken Derivative (finance) Financial markets Exchange-traded fund Arbitrage Personal finance Retirement plan Advance fee fraud Stock market index Berkshire Hathaway Collateralized debt obligation Gold standard Federal Reserve Bank fraud Cost of capital Credit card Free trade New Deal Internet fraud Monopoly (game) Lehman Brothers Money supply Surplus value Closed-end fund Long-Term Capital Management Variable universal life insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Donald Trump Economy of Iceland Health insurance Economy of Pakistan Wall Street Crash of 1929 Publicly funded medicine Goldman Sachs Federal National Mortgage Association

peg ratio how to calculate particular company peg ratio can u give me any simple example's the peg ratio is a comparison between the price of a stock a stock's p e and the expected eps yearly growth to calculate peg peg price annual earnings annual growth what are the accepted values for peg generally values of greater than show that the company is possibly overvalued or expects that the companies future earnings per share growth will be higher than the market estimates growth stock with peg values of less than means that the company may be undervalued or that the companies future earnings per share growth will be lower than the market estimates problems with peg peg ratios work best with growth companies income stocks companies are generally well established and offer less growth opportunities the growth estimate is exactly that an estimate it could change peg values ie greater than or less than are rules of thumb not absolutes peg does not account for inflation ie with peg if a company grows at the same speed as inflation the peg may have a number but it's rather meaningless since in reality there is no growth peg should be used as a description of the growth to price trade off not as an absolute peg ratios should not be used as the only valuation method since ratios are only as reliable as the data on which they are based peg ratio's should therefore be supplemented with other complementary methods to achieve a reasonable opinion peg ratios with low growth companies generate rather nonsensical values companies with zero growth cannot be calculated with peg divide by zero why use peg peg gives a relative value for a companies stock price based on future growth tends to work well with companies that are in the growth stage of their life cycle example calculation company xyz trades at current last reported eps is per share future estimated eps is per share company xyz is expected to have a earnings growth or positive growth current p e on estimated eps peg of company xyz note ratios should not be used as the only valuation method since ratios are only as reliable as the data on which they are based ratio's should therefore be supplemented with other complementary methods to achieve a reasonable opinion c chartfilter com http www chartfilter com education fundamentals htm  Inflation Annuity Corporate finance Market capitalization Surplus value Bretton Woods system Valuation (finance) Asian financial crisis Economic inequality Income statement Gold standard Monetary policy Capital accumulation Mutual fund Economy of Russia Capitalism Modern portfolio theory Economy of India Law of value Argentine Currency Board Stock Arbitrage Insurance Normal distribution Microeconomics Economics Capital asset pricing model FairTax Deflation (economics) Social Security debate (United States) Gross domestic product United Kingdom corporation tax Interest Institutional fund management United States dollar Biodiesel Derivative (finance) Short selling Central processing unit Finance Productive and unproductive labour Dot-com Digital photography Balassa-Samuelson effect Stock market Goodness and value theory The South Sea Company Employee stock option Technical analysis Cable television Doomsday argument Economy of Europe Mergers and acquisitions Option Exogenous growth model Exchange value Labor theory of value CIE 1931 color space ELO rating system Decibel Hubbert peak theory Eugene Fama Bayesian inference Income trust Keynesian economics Australian dollar Sea level rise Unemployment Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Probability Nuclear fusion Monetarism Solar variation Taxation in the United States Extreme Programming Tesco Strap-on dildo Philatelic investment Asset Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft Margin (finance) Hipparchus (astronomer) Property tax Economy of Pakistan

hyip do stupid ppl not realize that investing is a fixed sum game hi i'm a precocious know it all in finance from a top private university i am writing my thesis on comparing zero sum games vs fixed sum games my logic is that zero sum games are strikingly similar to fixed sum games for example retarded people believe that they can one up the market and make above average investment returns at the expense of no one these people believe in a synergy of if enough people invest in a concrete asset that the gains can offset the losses by an infinite amount that is that people who make a huge gain on investing on a stock which makes average gains can do so at no one's expense these magicians believe that everyone can make a huge r o i ret on inv on a stock that goes up only whereas my conjecture is that exceptional returns come at the expense of fool's losses please state your opinion and tell me your credentials for those who are truely motivated to end investor false confidence ty many authors on the market talk about it as though it was a zero sum game that those that make money do so at the expense of those that lose the losers didn't buy the author's book i guess on the other hand there are days when the market tanks like feb i am hard put to know where the money went if it were a zero sum game someone would have it somewhere because so many lost theirs i think that logic casts serious doubt on the zero sum game idea many of the authors i have read almost sound like a athletic coach trying to get the investor to be motivated and get on his market face be smart make money show you are better than the other team well attitude is important but stay cool i believe as many authors do that the price of stock has little to do with economics and has mostly to do with psychology that the market is like a mercado where people come together to trade their goods to barter to bid and offer remember the tulip panic of the late 's did the tulips have any particular intrinsic value only in the minds of the speculators of the time on the other hand hyips are almost all cons and p t barnum knew all about that sort of stuff nothing to do with investing everything to do with the two headed lady i think that your opinion of hyips is correct they are generally ponzi games on the market in general i do not accept the zero sum hypothesis or random walk either both are the exclusive property of academics come into my trading room by elder is a great read on the subject generally  Mutual fund Microeconomics Confidence trick Capital accumulation Ponzi scheme PE ratio Economics Gambling Keynesian economics Bond Deflation (economics) Derivative (finance) Technical analysis Annuity Hyperinflation Economy of Russia Law of value Bretton Woods system Social Security debate (United States) Supply-side economics Gold standard Wall Street Crash of 1929 Joseph P.

why do you think junior exploration companies are a major source of future mine supply the leases they bet on frequently in lesser developed countries are so risky that the majors won't put the money or time into them what you hope happens with a junior is that it finds a fine deposit and makes the deals to develop it after which a mid size outfit or senior will take it over via merger still the senior companies have already explored the areas near their existing properties quite well it is cheap compared to the value of extending a mine's life and so you can be pretty sure that major new sources of supply won't come from them which leaves only the companies who are active in new areas and many of them are juniors  Poker jargon Bank Gambling Betting (poker) Gold as an investment Gold Energy development Future energy development Arbitrage Pretty Good Privacy Citigroup Bond Blackjack Gold standard Insurance Uranium Baccarat Diamond Corporation Energy crisis Starfleet ranks and insignia Doomsday argument Oil shale SCO-Linux controversies Economy of Africa Warrant Officer PE ratio Security (finance) Corporate finance Economy of Russia Manganese nodule Economy of India Nuclear power Bank fraud Islamic banking Craps Space colonization Welding Mergers and acquisitions Naval mine Ernest Harmon Air Force Base Capitalism Economy of Asia Economy of the United States Money Sports betting Turquoise Universal Studios Education in the United States Airline Vertical integration Texas A&M University Corps of Cadets Temasek Holdings Suburbs of Johannesburg Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company Andes Ammolite Microsoft Confucianism Investment bank Professor Globalization Compiler optimization Martingale Alternative fuel United States Army Free trade Texas hold 'em Boeing Annuity Bulk vending War of the Pacific Economy of Norway United States v.

how long is a standard futures contract we often hear about futures contracts in the finance headlines but what is their length is it a month or months your question is confusing some futures will not expire for years others are going to expire this month on the chicago mercantile exchange most but not all futures contracts are listed on a month cycle that means for example there is a canadian dollar future which expires in march one which expires in june one in september and one in december on the hong kong futures exchange there is a series of contracts each year on the main hsi future contract on certain exchanges and for certain commodities there is a month cycle but the exchange adds contracts for the nearest months like for the hsi you would have march june sept and dec since now it is august you would be able to trade august september and december the exchange will add an october contract when august expires you would also be able to trade march and june  Futures contract Futures exchange Monetary policy Chicago Mercantile Exchange Hong Kong dollar Commodity markets Financial future New York Mercantile Exchange HSBC Economy of Hong Kong Stock exchange Option Asian financial crisis London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange Month Stock option Telephone numbering plan Arbitrage Deflation (economics) USS Chicago (CA-136) Hanscom Air Force Base Exchange rate Economy of Sri Lanka Derivative (finance) Economy of Macau Copyright law of the United Kingdom Roman calendar Japanese Occupation of Hong Kong Capitalism Inflation Hong Kong United States dollar USS Volador (SS-490) Julian calendar Gregorian calendar Calendar Eugene Fama USS Alfred A.

can any beleive that the stock dow went up isn't that amazing not that amazing many hedge funds short and when they are covering while others are buying on a dip this kind of run can happen since shorting is legal this can confuse people because you don't know if the sellers are bailing out shorting or both a high short rate can look like panic selling but if they were wrong it becomes panic buying as they try and cover that's why big named people tell people to ride it out and think long term the cool thing has been that people have been listening to that advice and have caused some big named hedge funds to go either bankrupt or unable to sell so billionares and millionares are barred by internal rules from selling shares they own as they are unable to trick using margin also known as short term loans the common investor to create good bargins by panic selling shorting on margin is dangerous because not only can they end up oweing more than your principal just from te shorting but they can owe more than for every they put into it just from the margin if they end up on the wrong side of the bet like they have they can get wiped out and that's what has been happening to them  Short selling Derivative (finance) Hedge fund Security (finance) Asian financial crisis Arbitrage Stock market Hedge (finance) Bond Stock Financial markets Gold standard Wall Street Crash of 1929 Insurance Mortgage Margin (finance) Microeconomics Islamic banking Poker jargon Craps Futures contract Short (finance) Debt Deflation (economics) Long-Term Capital Management Great Depression Hyperinflation Investment bank Option Finance Corporation Technical analysis Financial services Annuity Enron Corporation Day trading Capital accumulation Temasek Holdings Bank Shaggy dog story Closed-end fund Foreign exchange market Surplus value Bretton Woods system James J.

several retirement accounts or one i'm thinking about opening some retirements accounts and contribute very modestly what would be better to have a and a roth ira and contribute a little to both or just one of these and contribute more i'm talking here about the regular conservative accounts not the aggressive investing and i plan on leaving it there until i retire and then take out the whole thing this is a difficult question to give a good answer to as you are aware contributions to roth ira accounts are after tax contributions contributions to accounts are before tax contribuitions but that is just the beginning of the complexity when you withdraw the money from the it is taxed at the full tax rate when you withdraw money from a roth ira account it is not taxed at all and of course neither is taxed while the funds remain in the account one advantage of a roth ira maybe is that you are in full control the offers all kinds of investment options but perhaps not ones that you would wish there is perhaps a disadvantage to the roth ira option that is that almost all of the mutual funds and brokerage accounts where you can establish one have a minimum that is fairly substantial perhaps there is no minimum with the just put in what you wish now one thing that you need to be aware of is that if the is provided by a non profit tax exempt organization i believe that it might be subject to seizure by creditors of the organization government sponsors plans are not if your current tax rate is not great it may be to your advantage to use the roth ira you may think this is far fetched but it is possible that your retirement funds could grow into a very large amount and when you finally have to begin taking distributions you may have to take a fairly large sum more than annually on which you will have to pay taxes if it is not a roth ira account let us assume that you are year old and will work until you are and that your account will earn annually about average for equity based accounts based on history and that you contribute annually when you are you will have in your account earning annually think about that for a moment  401(k) Annuity Life insurance Roth IRA Social Security (United States) Variable universal life insurance Mutual fund Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Individual Retirement Account Social Security debate (United States) FairTax Tax Retirement plan Taxation in the United States Bond Flat tax Student loan United Kingdom corporation tax Pension Microeconomics Hedge fund Gross domestic product Surplus value Economy of India Security (finance) Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Bretton Woods system Capital accumulation Trust (Law) USA National Kidney Foundation Singapore Warren Buffett Citigroup Income trust Anarchism and capitalism Economy of Russia Minimum wage Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Keynesian economics Bank Stock Ponzi scheme Divorce Investment bank Registered Retirement Savings Plan Cost of capital Gold as an investment Corporate finance Economic inequality Productive and unproductive labour Publicly funded medicine Airline Health savings account Debt Mortgage Tax haven Deflation (economics) Fractional-reserve banking Salary cap Charles Haughey Primerica Financial Services Microcredit Supply-side economics Margin (finance) Money supply National Insurance Wells Fargo Inflation Credit card Capitalism Derivative (finance) Education in the People's Republic of China Goldman Sachs Personal finance Economy of Norway Toronto-Dominion Bank Guaranteed minimum income Wheel of Fortune Dividend Copyleft Unemployment No Child Left Behind Act United States Postal Service 529 plan Taxation in the Republic of Ireland PE ratio Economy of Pakistan Finance Economy of the United States Unemployment benefit Public policy Economy of South Africa

how can a dividend policy be created by the stockholder to suit his her personal needs i might be able to give a better answer if i knew what the personal needs were for a person requiring regular cash flow those of us who are retired for example investing in a mutual fund that pays monthly dividends would be a solution not all mutual funds pay dividends monthly but a few do those that invest in debt securities are more apt to than those investing in equities among the equity funds bcf pays monthly current distribution is about annually also bdj about annually and some others also now not all stocks pays dividends at the same time so it is possible to buy dividend paying stocks that have staggered pay dates so that you have a somewhat consistant cash flow not easy to do however requires a lot of work but lets look at a few high paying dividend stocks to give you and example bac pays quarterly on about and for example about currently bbt pays quarterly on about and about currently usb pays quarterly on about and about currently so by purchasing your securities based on dividend pay date it is possible to structure your portfolio so as to meet your personal financial needs not easy but possible i have no idea why all of these fancy stock screeners we have do not allow screening for dividend pay dates but then i always want more than i have  Mutual fund Corporate finance Annuity PE ratio Dividend Stock Bond Derivative (finance) Equity investment Warren Buffett Finance Security (finance) Life insurance Corporation Individual Savings Account Collateralized debt obligation Stock market Personal finance Rational pricing Financial markets Insurance Capital asset pricing model Black-Scholes Eugene Fama Cost of capital Debt Microsoft Pension Economy of Russia NASDAQ Venture capital Federal Reserve Social Security debate (United States) Exchange-traded fund Berkshire Hathaway Economy of India Mortgage Citigroup Money supply Tax Monetary policy Primerica Financial Services Lloyd's of London Short selling Equity swap Social Security (United States) Microeconomics Conglomerate (company) Institutional fund management Cooperative Closed-end fund Stock exchange Retirement plan Temasek Holdings Valuation (finance) Income tax Trust (Law) USA FairTax Futures contract Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economy of South Africa Technical analysis Mergers and acquisitions Margin (finance) Capital accumulation Fixed income Financial services Stock market index Hyperinflation Interest Economy of Chile Monopoly (game) Deflation (economics) Federal National Mortgage Association Canadian National Railway Credit card Cash flow statement Variable universal life insurance Stock broker Modern portfolio theory Housing cooperative Employee stock option Bretton Woods system Wells Fargo Mikhail Khodorkovsky 401(k) Anarchism and capitalism Financial analyst Sears Holdings Corporation EBITDA Swap (finance) Modigliani-Miller theorem Great Depression Financial audit

in equity valuation how closely related is the volume of shares traded to the movement of a stock price also if a stock is overbought or oversold why would that effect a stock price thanks good question volume is a variable independent of the stock's price and change in direction the information it broadcast by itself is unique because it's separate from price action for example if you see high volume it does not tell you how many people are buying or selling even if the price drops or falls however in it's simplest form volume reflects the level of enthusiasm or lack of it directed to the price movement of a stock generally volume precedes and or accompaniesprice for example when a stock starts to move up in the context of an uptrend higher highs and higher lows on a daily or minutes chart strong to average volume will usually accompany it on a standard bar or candle chart however important volume alone cannot by itself be used as a decision making tool for buying or selling stock you have to combine it with other indicators complicated measures called oscillators macd adx dmi rsi etc and things called candles if some of these indicators are in concert and the momentum and velocity of the volume cooperates with the price action then it could be said that volume confirms the price movement a more useful indicator is the on balance volume obv indicator developed by joe granville this indicator correlates volume to price change check out any of the fiancial websites yahoo msn scottrade has great charts and tools investopedia com to learn more also you get the chart for any stock and pick these indicators to appear on your chart scottrade has great charting if you choose to plug in any these indicators obv macd dmi etc it then tells you what they are doing for the time frame you're looking at and tells you what this means regarding the stock price movement whether a stock is currently oversold or overbought is something that is measured by the stochastics indicator again can be viewed by choosing on a standard stock chart as a lower indicator on the screen here's how it works if a stock that's in a confirmed downtrend bearish people selling off becomes oversold stochastics line below it means the continued downward trend cannot be maintained and it might be a good time to buy if other indicators are bullish conversely if a stock is in a confirmed uptrend bullish people buying price rising and becomes overbought stochastics line greater than it means that the stock may beginning to lose its upward price momentum however stocks in a long uptrend see apple aapl chart past months for a good example can trrade in an overbought condition for an extended period of time if in a long rally but remember none of these indicators should ever be used as stand alone buy sell signals but must be used in concert withother indicators and the market as a whole sounds like your interested in technical analysis trading a good way to keep emotins out of it and not have to do a lot of research on the company fundamentals a good way to understand the stock market and make money too hope that's not tmi and answers your question happy investing  Inflation Economics Microeconomics PE ratio Monetary policy Short selling Mutual fund Deflation (economics) Stock market Gross domestic product Bond Capitalism Day trading Option Labor theory of value Economy of Russia Political economy Supply-side economics Gold standard Tide Derivative (finance) Security (finance) Institutional fund management Gold as an investment Arbitrage Asian financial crisis Law of value Finance Model (economics) Behavioral finance Labour economics Arthur Laffer Surplus product Action potential Hyperinflation Sea level rise Equity investment Stochastic process Solar variation Entropy Dow Theory United Kingdom corporation tax Equine conformation Market capitalization Dynamical system Black-Scholes Psychology Investment bank Causality Mergers and acquisitions Intellectual property Anchor TGV Gravity Advertising Newton's laws of motion Hedge fund Explosive material Japan-United States relations Productive and unproductive labour General relativity Pound sterling Globalization Great Depression IBM PC compatible Prices of production Trade Real estate bubble Goodness and value theory Special relativity Dot-com Citigroup Berkshire Hathaway Price discrimination Comprehensive Program for Socialist Economic Integration Force Free market MP3 Anarchism and capitalism Embedded system Normal distribution

are annuities best investment vehicle for most of assets i am early 's still employed with moderate inheritance sibling pushing me to invest at least in annuity doesn't this limit me to interest only of my own money what would you suggest if any yes it depends on what type of annuity your sibling is speaking about you are still years from the average retirement age and in most cases annuities charge very high fees to maintain insurance fees administration fees it sounds like you are asking about a fixed annuity where you invest a lump sum upfront and in return you are paid a fixed amount over time until death these are used for current income and you would not be able to access the lump sum you invested given that you are still employed and relatively young there are better and more efficient lower cost ways to invest also have you considered putting money aside in an ira with mutual fund investment options an ira grows tax free so you can maximize the compounding effect of your investment  Annuity Life insurance Mutual fund Variable universal life insurance Social Security debate (United States) Bond Tax Microeconomics Present value Pension Citigroup Student loan Corporate finance Mortgage Taxation in the United States Capitalism Keynesian economics Inflation Lottery FairTax Capital accumulation Actuarial notation Ponzi scheme Stock Gross domestic product Trust (Law) USA Interest Hedge fund Security (finance) Rational pricing United States Postal Service Freeters Surplus value Financial services Social Security (United States) Supply-side economics Microcredit Warren Buffett United Kingdom corporation tax Personal finance National Insurance Roth IRA Supply and demand Unemployment benefit Medicare (Canada) Bretton Woods system Economy of Russia Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 SCO-Linux controversies Flat tax Individual Savings Account Primerica Financial Services Income trust TIAA-CREF Reaganomics Economy of the United States Trust (Law) non-USA Investment bank Health savings account Advance fee fraud Derivative (finance) Canada Health Act Wal-Mart Divorce Credit card Monetary policy Inheritance tax Economy of India Bank Economic inequality Cost of capital Education in the People's Republic of China Michael Milken Money supply Mergers and acquisitions Economic rent Public transport Labour economics Islamic banking Deflation (economics) Lloyd's of London Progressive tax Wealth condensation Consumption of fixed capital Nuclear power Modern portfolio theory Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Capital asset pricing model Public good

do u think it is a good idea to invest in dominos pizza it depends on whether you're talking about buying into a franchise of buying their stock dpz ticker on nyse the franchises can be very profitable if your location and market are good it will require alot of work but if you like running a pizza business go for it they are one of the most successful franchise business models in history they wrote the book on franchising but that was years ago things have gone a bit stale for them of late if you're talking about the stock sit back and read they have had recent problems and poor earnings but may be viewed as going for a good price value as a long term investment position it's a tough question you pose i wouldn't be in any great hurry to buy right now you have time to do some research it took a huge plunge from share to in may and has been trading sideways for some time now most recent price around recent nd quarter earnings report horrible historic low for the company at eps here are some facts on domino's pizza as a company and stock dpz which should help guide your decision week hi lo where it's at currently pe ratio is below restaurant sector and s p as a whole peg ratio x again good value c w restaurant sector average trading volume is million so active enough to see momentum swings gains or losses dpz underperformed its sector by so it's not the best restaurant stock but not the worst rated as a hold by most investment firms currently not a buy that is jim cramer guru of mad money recently recommended holding off on buying dpz for now however target price predicted to be in months if true that's gain we'll see recent news they announced are launching a service for ordering on the internet they recently announced price increases on their menu due to higher food costs bottom line it's not the best restaurant stock or best stock period just had huge plummet in may and recent q earnings plunge the stock is cheap for a reason if you're a long haul investor i think it represents a good value i think most of the institutional players and fear factor investors have been flushed out of their positions already so price prob won't go much lower if you're commited to owning it buy some now and then more at first sign of confirmed uptrend several consecutive higher highs on daily trading for better performers in resaurant sector check out cmg chipotle's mexican grill deli pzzi pizza inn nath nathan's deli wszl western sizzlin' they are all on a roll pizza inn's stock has had the biggest month gains in the pizza game a whopping remember it's not just how big or how well known the company is or what their pizza tastes like or even if you like the brand using this criteria is the basis of uninformed emotional investing a great way to lose money and get stuck in some real investment dogs don't listen to your neighbor the stock pro buddy at work or most the folks on this q a site do some research neat and cool appearing companies often have poor stock performance not even their total sales or revenues always matters it's about the perception on wall street and among investors that drives stock prices a company like domino's may be selling the most pizza and having a ton of sales but if it below what is expected the stock price falls capisch hope this answers your question or at least allows you to make an informed decision good luck with investing and remember to eat your vegetables not just pepperonis  Microeconomics Privatization Enron Corporation Tesco Investment bank Citigroup Technical analysis Deflation (economics) Bond Economics Sears Holdings Corporation Inflation Short selling Mergers and acquisitions McDonald's Hedge fund Economy of Russia Asian financial crisis FairTax Gold as an investment Free trade Capitalism Surplus value Day trading Temasek Holdings Economy of Nigeria Supply-side economics Euro MP3 Arbitrage Ford Motor Company Economy of Pakistan Warren Buffett MMORPG Monetary policy Economy of Venezuela Gross domestic product Stock market Social Security debate (United States) Eugene Fama Hyperinflation Stock Great Depression Berkshire Hathaway United Kingdom corporation tax Productive and unproductive labour New York Giants Dot-com Microsoft Income trust Natural monopoly Labor theory of value Finance Electronic commerce Nintendo Insurance Poker jargon Fast-food restaurant Economy of the United States Corporate finance Bank Gold standard Advertising Wal-Mart Derivative (finance) Outsourcing UK Singles Chart Xerox Google Corporation Corporate governance Tax Law of value Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Monopoly (game) Economy of Sri Lanka Islamic banking Arthur Laffer __lectricit__ de France Life insurance Income statement Market capitalization Debt Hard disk Institutional fund management Strategic management Economy of Chile Airline Prices of production $ale of the Century

how do the bid and ask work for options i have shares of a stock and was thinking of doing a covered call to get some income if it was called away at the strike price i'd still be happy because i would make over a holding period return over months if the market and stock continue to decline or stay flat at least i have some income the bid and ask for the call option are and respectively does that mean that if i sell a call i get for each contract and if i buy a call it would cost for each contract assuming you buy or sell at the market then yes that would all be true by buying or selling at the market you're selling at the bid or buying at the ask sometimes called the offer you can use a limit order though and in this case you might want to try instead of entering your order to sell at the market and hoping you sell for you could put in a limit order to sell at or try to start by offering at you might not get the order executed but given the difference in premium it's worth a shot and one more point that first answer is wrong in regard to how the brokers make money they'll charge you a commission to execute the trade that spread between the bid and ask is a function of the market place it's generally proprietary traders that's why they're called market makers who seek to make money from the spread not brokers  Football in England R.S.C.

how does it help a company if i buy their stock when the goes to the broker and whoever sold it as the company does not receive any portion of my investment other than when it is initially offered how does it affect them when their stock is sold or when people divest in their holdings you take on part of their debt and allow them to use the money for new equipment and products when you sell the stock the next person takes the risk that they will or won't pay dividends the only return you get on your investment is the dividend or net profit therefore if they don't make money you don't get paid you take part of the risk that the business will fail when ford was incorporated he only had four investors he bought them out as soon as he could he didn't want people to earn with no effort imagine if they hadn't sold it would be worth  Hedge fund Bond Life insurance Insurance Citigroup Corporation Corporate finance 401(k) Social Security debate (United States) Security (finance) Stock Money supply Finance Stock market Microeconomics Institutional fund management Capital accumulation Investment bank Bank Financial services Mergers and acquisitions Income trust Monetary policy Retirement plan Corporate governance United Kingdom corporation tax Capital asset pricing model Modern portfolio theory Warren Buffett Eugene Fama Economy of Russia Berkshire Hathaway Long-Term Capital Management Stock market index Variable universal life insurance Individual Savings Account Individual Retirement Account Debt Option Equity investment Economy of Iceland Gross domestic product Arbitrage Gold as an investment Economy of Nigeria Deflation (economics) Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation PE ratio Venture capital Asian financial crisis Short selling Bank fraud Monopoly (game) Microcredit Financial markets Taxation in the United States Enron Corporation Exchange-traded fund Roth IRA Michael Milken Bretton Woods system Internet fraud Surplus value Intellectual property Technical analysis Tax Toronto-Dominion Bank Financial analyst Mad Money Morgan Stanley Credit card Economics Black-Scholes Health insurance Foreign exchange market FairTax Municipal bond Interest Yield curve The Vanguard Group Labor theory of value __lectricit__ de France Islamic banking Philatelic investment Federal National Mortgage Association Stock broker Dot-com

is it illegal to invest a loan i know a professional forex trader who has been trading for years as his job i was thinking about taking out a line of credit and having him add it to his funds and be my trader he averages a day and takes a commission so i would make profit a month off the line of credit is this illegal there are clearly no legal issues for you you can do whatever you'd like with your money however there may be some legal issues for him he takes a commission sounds like he takes of the profits in order for him to take an incentive fee like that he would probably need to have a hedge fund structure that is he would have an investment vehicle that allows him to take your money if that's true he would need to make sure that you are an accredited investor that is satisfying the following a natural person who has individual net worth or joint net worth with the person s spouse that exceeds million at the time of the purchase a natural person with income exceeding in each of the two most recent years or joint income with a spouse exceeding for those years and a reasonable expectation of the same income level in the current year or a trust with assets in excess of million not formed to acquire the securities offered whose purchases a sophisticated person makes if you don't satisfy that he would need to jump through some real hoops to be able to collect that incentive fee and not run afoul of the rules given these issues i recommend that you spend some time talking to him as well as talking to an investment pro before you invest good luck  New York Stock Exchange Stock market Short selling Wall Street Day trading Stock broker Wall Street Crash of 1929 Mutual fund Investment bank Foreign exchange market Citigroup Stock Real estate broker Warren Buffett Eliot Spitzer London Stock Exchange Wall Street (movie) Financial markets United Parcel Service Derivative (finance) Financial services Margin (finance) The Wall Street Journal Stock trader American Express Sanford I.
