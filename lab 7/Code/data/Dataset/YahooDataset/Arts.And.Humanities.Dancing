how can i bellydance like shakira is there anything i can do to teach myself in my spare time how to bellydance any pointers would be greatly appreciated there are a number of how to belly dance videos out there they vary in quality and style you can pick up some technique from practice with a video but nothing replaces a live instructor a good teacher is not just one who dances well but one who understands how to break down the movement into its individual parts and how muscle and bone work together to create that movement a good teacher can also watch what you are doing and tell which part of the movement you need help with middle eastern dance is all about interpreting the music through movement i don t think that is easily captured or taught on video that takes time training and watching sometimes for years to truly capture the essence of the music belly dance is a folk dance passed down from generation to generation through example so to answer you question can i teach myself you can learn some movements you can get some exercise and you can have fun but to truly learn how to belly dance you need an instructor your state or city may have a middle eastern dance association you can yahoo search it good luck and happy shimmies  Belly dance Martial art Aikido Music Shakira Glossary of partner dance terms Tai Chi Chuan Eskrima Society for Creative Anachronism Harp West Coast Swing Scottish highland dance Modern dance Violin Alexander Technique Parachuting Marching band Chinese martial arts Intelligent design movement Education John G.

how long does it generally take to begin dancing on pointe talking about ballet here to be en pointe you need strong ankles and legs and you need proper placement good balance and a good understanding of basic ballet you shouldn't start pointe unless you are about years old because your bones aren't developed properly anytime before then and you risk serious injury if you start from a young age like it will take about or years if you start in your teens or older it will probably only take you to years you'll grasp concepts faster than younger students and be able to move to pointe quicker plus you don't have to wait for your bones to develop  Equine conformation Aerial (dance move) Glossary of ballet terms Professional wrestling holds Weight training Martial art Ballet Decompression sickness Theory of conduct Anterior cruciate ligament Glossary of partner dance terms Modern dance Figure skating Proprioception Pointe shoes Paragliding Acupuncture Tourniquet Dog training Butterfly stroke Swingout Fast bowling Japanese tea ceremony Free trade Contredanse Jessica Lynch CPU design Password Tango (dance) West Coast Swing Aikido Puberty Natural Selection (computer game) Swimming Sheepshead Piccolo Junior Saga Naruto jutsu En pointe Fielding (cricket) Hiking Diving The nature of God in Western theology Redundant array of independent disks Brian Close Denise Lewis Irish dance Childbirth RuneScape Random Events Teen idol Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Human height Backstroke Motorcycle helmet Cancer Cerebral palsy Contract bridge Tetrapod Snowboarding Extreme Programming Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Tibia Spanking Faster-than-light Minor league baseball Shaggy dog story Traumatic brain injury Carpal tunnel syndrome W.

is it bad to have a fringe when you do dancing i have a fringe that is almost long enough to pull back into a ponytail it's a pain for dancing because we are not allowed to have hair in our faces i always have to pin my fringe back and it gets annoying people say i look better with a fringe should i grow it out for dancing i can't wear it it's against the rules it's all about giving it up for dancing slick your fringe bangs back down with hair gel then spray it with a strong holding hair spray you probably take a shower shampoo right after you are finished dancing so you won't have to worry about it clogging your pores just clean your forehead face really good after spraying the hair spray you don't want to clog up your pores ps many famous dancers have had a fringe bangs perhaps once they became famous they were able to wear their hair how they pleased whether you grow it out or keep it the way it is should be entirely up to you  Haircut Ponytail Comanche Professional wrestling match types Hair Baldness Dreadlocks Joy (novel) Kodocha Pepper spray Beard Shampoo Kurt Angle Totally Spies!

emo goth i don't understand people ok before i start my question so many people argue over the true meaning of what emo and goth means so before i get to my question i feel i have to explain cause i know that theres bound to be one or two idiots that come in here and say something stupid like emo people hate life and they all wanna die or goth people all paint their face and wear only black i hate stereotypes so before i get into my question i am goign to explain what emo and goth really mean emo emo much like almost all terms in the world does not mean just one thing the first use of the word does not neccessarily mean every use of the word just as the words desert mean light leave and on and on all have more then one meanings so does emo and all the meanings of emo are an abbriviation of a bigger word for example emotive emotional emulator but for the most part my reference today is about emo emotional and dont be the retard that says emo is not short for emotional goth goth are not people who all wear black clothes we dont all paint our faces we don't worship satan and aren't evil despite what some ignorant people might say we dont all listen to techno or deathmetal one person even said real goths are not depressing and suicidal thats not true either just cause someone is depressed or has emotional problems does not mean they are not gothic what goth realy is someone who likes the darker side of things sees the beauty in what other call gloomy or depressing someone who sees the artistic aspect of things not so pleasent to some so to my question why doe people stereotype why does everyone thing emo people cut themself why do people all say goths worship the devil why do pople say that emo's or goths dress or act a certain way why why why pinkkkk emo people are very emotional and very sensitive and practically bipolar but i don't think they want to die i thank thats when you cross the line to goth did u not read anything i said now your doing exactly what i hate 'stereotyping goths do not want to die and i dont know many emo's that have f cking bipolar wtf cryptotich emo and goth have deep roots in the 's scene for one goth did not originate in the last years goth came from the th century of a race of people that lived in the same reagon as the hun's a race of people who would not conform to the ways of the country so they were outcasted lilykdesign you have had the most intelligent answer thus far but i dont agree with some of what you said however you have not helped the rest of us here by stating your rant in fact you've made it worse by furthering the styretypes that emos are brainless how the f ck am i furthering the stereotype that emo's are brainless most emos misinterpret that to mean it gives them the god given right to be over dramatic little turds this has given birth to stereotypes most no i dont think so but yes i agree that a lot do very good point of course there is a huge difference between emo and goth real goths would more than likely beat the snot out of you if you dared to suggest they might be emo this is not true not all goths go around beating people up a lot of goths keep to themselves just like emo do thats not an aspect of goth or emo also like i said before this post has nothing to do with music or its use in it cerantine freaking emogoth go rant on a vampire website another stereotypical dumbazz dude if you don't have any intelligent feedback shut the f ck up goths are not vampire's goth's don't think they are vampires do not confuse a goth with a poser cerantine freaking emogoth go rant on a vampire website i'm not the one who frickin posted my rant on a dance forum if you don't want to be stereotyped get over yourself and go buy some yellow clothes you messed up poser lol just stfu i didnt intend to post this in a dance forum i did not select dance forum obviously it was a glitch ive already reported this to the site tech support i dont wear only black stupid f ck so just f ck off and stop posting lilykdesign bauhaus first concerts said they reminded him of the victorian gothic movement hence where the term goth was coined your an idiot bauhaus did not coin the term goth the term goth has been around since the early th century bugaboo why is this in the dance catagory you need a life i've already explained why this is in the dance section i'm sorry you cant read i need a life because id like to discuss the unnecessary point of stereotypes lol if you say so chris p as far as i can tell emo kids are popkids well i can see like most all these other brainless zombies you didn't see my post at all obviously you read it but you didn't see it cause you didn't get it at all for u didn't answer my question and ndly you did exactly what this post was about stereotyping no i don't like pop and i'm not a kid so nope sorry try again as a goth and i've been a goth since the 's i can tell you that you had it closest when you said it's about seeing the beauty in the darker side of things the old goth cliche says it best there can be no light without dark goths chose to embrace that dark and see the beauty within it if you're interested in the late s it was actually bauhaus that ruled the goth music movement the cure came along a little later so i can't speak for emo kids as i am not one nor do i worship the devil i don't paint my face white and never have i do where all black but do not dress in victorian garb as for your question about stereotypes labeling ourselves as goth emo jock etc is the ugly cousin of stereotyping once we put that label on ourselves or another we have started the ugly ball rolling remember the grunge phase it has been going on for years and years and unfortunately people will always stereotype each other especially when they do not understand or see the other's view i've known nerds who were just as cruel and taunting as jocks and jocks who have the hearts of saints stereotyping has been around for years and until people let down their protective goth walls or jock walls or whatever little pigeon hole they have found a safe place in and realise that we are all on this earth together and not so different after all it will continue great now i sound like a hippie joke intended  Recurring South Park characters Pop punk Death rock Grunge music Kyle Broflovski

doesn't harm joints i love dancing i used to do loads but had to give it up cos i kept spraining my ankle really badly and my mum refused to let me go back that was a few years ago now though and i really want to get back into dancing is there a form of dancing other than belly oriental dancing that isn't as intense on your joints esp ankles thanks x dancing like running and aerobics puts stress on your joints because of 'shearing forces' the side to side stresses as someone who knackered the cartilege in my knees playing rugby i'd say this if you build muscle strength around the affected joint it can really help i still squat over kg and cycle miles or more every week i'd suggest you build your calf strength with four exercises to hit the muscle you can see on the back of your leg do calf raises going up on your toes whilst holding a weight but do it three ways with your feet straight out turned in and turned out calf muslces are really tough 'cos we use em all the time so you will prob' need to exercise till it really hurts to see the benefit usual rules apply muscle pain is fine but stop if you feel anything else the other thing is that the soleus calf muscle doesn't work unless your knees are bent so you'll need to do calf raises sitting down it's the gastronemeus that you can see at the back of your leg scuse spelling and that works when your knees are locked my hunch is that the soleus is where you can really build some stability for your ankle as it's the muscle structure that wraps all the way around your lower legs if you can't find a gym with the right machine then just use a bench and put weights on your knees and lift em again by going up on your toes i'm guessing you're a girl and if that's so then don't worry about getting all muscular and 'not feminine' you don't have the testosterone required to gain muscle in the way that guys do and it also means you probably don't get zits like us or die years earlier or suffer from road rage i know this is somewhat away from your question but really dancing is always gonna be tough on your joints but you can do it if you just address where you're weakest you might also try a spoonfull of hemp oil every day it doesn't taste omg awful like cod's liver oil doesn't have cadmium and other heavy metals that the poor old cod's liver has been straining out of our polluted seas and has a natural balance of the omega types so you can actually absorb it it tastes like nuts to me and it has really helped me i use an organic one but then i'm kinda precious i hear glucosamine is cool too though i haven't tried it i understand though that the off the shelf varieties are crap see if you can get your doc' to prescribe it for you huh stilll at last to get back to your actual question if you were actually spraining your ankle then you can strengthen your lower legs with these exercises in a few weeks you will find it hard to sprain anything if it is a cartilege issue then similaraly strengthening the musculature in your lower legs will soak up some damage as will the supplements and you can crazy legs or tango to your heart's content  Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling throws Diving Tai Chi Chuan Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Osteoarthritis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Professional wrestling attacks Muscle Swimming Urinary incontinence Squat (exercise) Suplex Spanking Terminal ballistics Doom enemies Soleus muscle Mixed martial arts Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Skateboarding trick Fecal incontinence Massage Repetitive strain injury Seismic retrofit Horse Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Running Omega-3 fatty acid Childbirth Aikido Exercise Bodybuilding Swingout Prostate cancer Decompression sickness Figure skating Chronic fatigue syndrome High-heeled shoe Glossary of climbing terms Stress fracture Bicycle Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milton H.

what can i expect if i start taking jazz dance lessons i've strictly been a latin and ballroom dancer but i've always wanted to take jazz what should i expect how should i dress are there shoes for jazz i remember when i took african dance there was no one in there that wasn't a dancer everyone was a dancer of some trade in jazz are there people starting off for the very first time i'm ok you're not too late for your age to take jazz lessons but start sooner why coz you will do a lot of stretching and warm ups you will experience the following french terms for jazz ballet as well routines such as jete grand jete plie etc etc other terms like single and double step and so many others expect lots of bumps and bruises on your feet arms and legs for fast routines normal for you to fall or hit the wall splitting is so normal i hope you do already warm ups in jazz take mins to an hour depending on the choreographer find a nice pair of tights or leotards or leg warmers as well for your outfit a jogging pants will do but make sure it's stretchable and durable ballet shoes will do but in my experience i'm more comfortable in barefoot while rehearsing to add more grip on the floor in jazz or even ballet dance steps are easily created mentioning only the terms so be quick to remember them for your routines mind you dancing jazz is addictive whenever you hear some music you would feel like flying with those routines you had learned you will feel very light and alert once you learn to isolate those parts of your body and will be very graceful with your moves one thing i've noticed with jazz and ballet dancers as well they walk with their feet outwards this is due to rigorous stretching on the floor and on the bar have fun these are all my first hand experiences and until now i feel sexy because of jazz  Aerial (dance move) Lindy Hop Glossary of ballet terms Irish dance Glossary of partner dance terms Contredanse Swingout Tap dance Jazz Figure skating Tango (dance) West Coast Swing Dance Diving Equine conformation Modern dance Marching band Professional wrestling holds Volleyball Ballroom dance Circle (dance move) Scottish country dance English Country Dance Horse gait Breakdancing Can-can Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Badminton Ceroc Music genre Swing (dance) Social rule Side pass (dance move) Milton H.

can i still do ballet if i am doing track and field as well from the age of five i did ballet by the age of ten or eleven i decided to quit and join track and field today i still do track but am wondering if it would be possible to join ballet again since my leg muscles are more developed for track and field of course you can always do ballet again however there are a few things you should know a dancer's muscles are very different from the muscles you use for track your muscles will be a little bulkier and developed in different areas than people in ballet track is not always good for ballet the impact of running is can be harsh on dancer's legs because it can multiply the weight by however you already have developed resistance to the impact since you have been running so you are okay there bonus you probaly already have developed ankle and core muscles which helps alot in dance when at home practicing for dance really concentrate on turnout and using the correct muscles never give up anything you love and i'm sure you can keep up with both since you are already expirienced have fun work hard and enjoy what you are doing and you should suceed in both good luck  Weight training Dance Modern dance Aerial (dance move) Glossary of ballet terms Irish dance Lindy Hop Proprioception Ashlee Simpson Equine conformation Figure skating Ballet En pointe Terminal ballistics Pointe shoes Rod Stewart Belly dance Diving Fleetwood Mac Exercise Dragon Booster Glossary of partner dance terms Royal Danish Ballet Connection (dance) Highland games Bicycle Scottish highland dance Kathak Afternoon of a Faun (ballet) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Professional wrestling throws C__line Dion Robert Helpmann Jazz dance Tap dance Gwen Verdon Fecal incontinence Princess Tutu Rudolf Nureyev Love.

a question about dance studios ok ive been danceing for years and i am still horrible i mean i guess i am good at the actual danceing part i just have limited flexibility and balance so i cant really do fancy stuff like multiple pirouettes fouettes and stuff like that well the dance studio i am at now doesnt really teach the recreational kids how to do pirouettes or fouettes or the correct way to do leaps we go across the floor but thats only for minutes so it doesnt really help and it sucks because i always wanted to be a dancer but i feel like the studio i am at is holding me back somehow so i kinda want to switch plus some girls dont like me there because of my 'vibrant personality' lol n e way so i was looking for other studios online but they all seem so different ya know i mean i like the studio i am at now because the teachers are nice adn i know them and its pretty free and not strict which is what i like and they have all the classes i like so when i look at other studios i k they just look wierd so my question is should i keep my same dance studio even though there are snotty competition brats there and they dont teach us how to dance or switch studios no we dont take classes with the competition girls i just dont want to feel like a loser danceing with them at the recitals and stuff and i know they talk about us becaus ewere not as good as them and i already am in the highest rec level at my studio there are only but pretty much u can move urself up if u want so we have girls that should be in the rd level in the th i think you should totally go out of your comfort zone and switch studios i know exactly how you feel because i was in the exact situation years ago i had recently switched to a new studio and i felt that i was being held back because i wasn't quite good enough to be in competition but i wasn't getting the help i needed in order to improve and move up to competition i decided to switch to a dance studio that had regular classes semi competition lines and competition lines for my first years there i was accpeted into the semi performing lines which i was fine about because i was learning a lot of new things but i still wasn't very happy because i like you thought the competition girls were snotty and always talked about how they were better than us this last year i was finally accepted into the nd best of competition lines and i realized i was very wrong to judge those girls they didn't talk about the lower classes at all and they turned out to be the nicest girls i know when i look back and think of how at first i wasn't sure if i wanted to switch studios i realize now that i am soooo thankful i did it changed my life i have so many gret new friends and i feel like i truly have become a great dancer if you're apprehensive about starting at a new studio try and take classes at both your current studio and the one you are considering that way you won't have a problem going back to the old one if the new one doesn't work out i can't encourage you enough to check out other studios in your area it could completely change your life for the better and hey whats the worst that could happen worst case you continue your classes at your current studio it's probably not as bad as you make it out to be be proud of the fact that you have personality that's what makes lots of dancers who they are when they perform on stage and finally don't worry about what you think the competition girls are saying about you because it's probably not true anyway i see it like this the girls in competition have the natural talent to dance and yes we work very hard to improve but it comes naturally to us the girls in the regualar classes and semi competition lines try hard too it's just that they have decided not to make dance the only commitment in their lives and maybe it doesn't come as naturally to them so what my advice to you is to try out a few other studios one that focuses energy on teaching the recreation classes how to improve if they so wish as well best of luck to you and feel free to contact me if you like christina  Theory of conduct Glossary of ballet terms Avenue Q Humphrey Bogart Martial art 2000 Australian Grand Prix Shaggy dog story The Ashlee Simpson Show Atomic Kitten Pitaten Irish dance Cliff Richard Friends Jennifer Lopez Milton H.

anyone knows how can i strengthen my legs easily and unexpensively points for the best question good luck i guess you meant points for the best answer didn't you please bear with me this is kind of long but it's worth the time to read it if you want a specific routine to strengthen your legs gradually without injuring yourself in the process walking and running are great ways to build leg strength however over time your legs become accustomed to the motion and eventually can hit a plateau this could also limit your performance resistance training with free weights or weight machines is a great way to improve leg strength and add an extra kick to the latter stages of your run and walk squats squatting is the best resistance workout you can do this exercise works almost all of the muscles in the lower body and is a great way to build leg strength this is a must have in your program lunges lunges are a great way to enhance strength and stability in your legs since you are forced to balance all of your body weight on one leg for a short period of time as an extra you'll develop a sexy butt no other exercise develops the butt as this one does leg curls this exercise works the back part of the legs the hamstring muscle group this is especially pertinent for runners since most runners have very strong quadricep muscles the ones on the front part of the leg and have weak hamstring muscles you say inexpensively so i suggest you do the following go sign up in a budget gym where there are free weights to do squats lunges and curls with an instructor to tell you exactly how to do it tell him her that you want to develop strength for walking and running your only equipment is a very good pair of running shoes and several pairs of resistant and comfortable sports socks at any of your local sports shoes stores the personnel there can give you advice on your best and budget options to walk and run if you've never jogged or ran before do the following every time you go for a jog you have to walk briskly for five minutes before beginning your jogging session to warm up and avoid injuries then do as follows tthe first week you should start jogging two minutes and walking fast for two minutes until you complete minutes non stop nd week you duplicate the time for jogging four minutes jog two minutes walk until you complete minutes d week you duplicate your jogging time again eight minutes jogging two minutes walking until you complete minutes and finally the fourth week you may try the whole minutes jogging only you should alternate the exercises one day you do resistance exercises squats lunges leg curls the next day you jog and the next day you rest to give your muscles time to rest recover and become stronger the more weight you gradually use specially on the squats keeping perfect form avoiding to bend your back and always using a waist belt knee pads and thigh pads the stronger you'll get and sexier looking i've done what i've told you it has worked marvels for me got me from spaghetti weak legs to nice looking and more powerful legs without looking overly developed like those of bodybuilders who don't run and just want to get brutally huge which to my taste is not very aesthetic good luck  Aerial (dance move) Iliotibial band syndrome Bodybuilding Swimming Glossary of climbing terms Triathlon Professional wrestling holds Exercise Strap-on dildo The Contender (television series) Deadlift Childbirth Biped Mixed martial arts Squat (exercise) Muscle Diving Horse gait Urinary incontinence Marathon (sport) Chondromalacia patellae Horizontal bar Japanese toilet Breaststroke Professional wrestling throws Figure skating Boxing American football First aid Decompression sickness Muay Thai Poker jargon Tenshinhan Marching band Double bass Undergarment Clean and jerk Tetrapod Recumbent bicycle Aikido Extreme Programming Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Whose Line Is It Anyway?

pointe question i realize that this question may sound stupid but i'm gonna ask anyways as i'm really curious i'm just a beginning dancer does dancing on pointe hurt at all how do dancers deal with the pain if any pointe dancers deal with pain in different ways personally i don't think dancing on pointe hurts too much but i have very good shoes also when i first started i got a brand that was very popular but i hated them then i switched to gaynor minden and haven't went off them since the only thing that hurts for me is when i cut my toenails too short or when my ankles get sore from all of the up and down movement some dancers take a small amount of painkiller but i don't think that's very wise because they need to know when they're hurting so they can tell if something is wrong i personally just live with the pain if there is any we learn to tough it out  Pointe shoes Diving Theory of conduct Aerial (dance move) High-heeled shoe Equine conformation Contredanse The Ashlee Simpson Show Belly dance Irish dance Jennifer Lopez Shaggy dog story Kodocha Spanking Cindy Sheehan Rush Limbaugh Nine Inch Nails Utilitarianism Stoicism Tai Chi Chuan Glossary of ballet terms Tina Turner Value system Dance Lindy Hop Jon Secada Tap dance Indian English Goodness and value theory Smallville (Season 4) Alcoholics Anonymous Hip hop culture R.E.M.

why dont baptists dance i am a baptist i have been teaching children in the sunday school for years i am also a full time dance instructor in ballroom and latin dances see so about the baptists its hard to put them all in one category cause they are a diverse society but mainly they are more likely to be conservative or somewhere in the middle there are much more conservative church denominations they step firmly on the bible every local church usually decides their own issues in the way they think its appropriate for them i remember what a scandal it was when our youth group first put the drums in the hall of the church all the old traditional ladies ware offended and ready to defend christ to death hopefully our pastors were thought full men and within a year nobody could imagine a worship service without the drums so be patient with people's prejudice and if it is important to you to dance and you're a baptist then you better pray if not hope you learned a little more about our baptist christian society which is often very friendly dynamic and progressive  Church of Christ Southern Baptist Convention Religious Society of Friends John the Baptist Christian denomination Roman Catholic Church Christianity Baptism Reformed Baptist History of Christianity Sabbath Lutheranism Methodism Christian-Jewish reconciliation Catechism Plymouth Brethren Minister of religion Catholicism New Testament Restorationism Independent Baptist Protestantism Evangelicalism Eucharist Homosexuality and Christianity Mission (Christian) Evangelical Lutheran Church in America Mainline Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints A Course In Miracles Richard Allen (reverend) Christian right Traditionalist Catholic Clergy Megachurch Church of Christ, Scientist Religious pluralism Priesthood (Mormonism) Liberal Christianity Bible and reincarnation Opus Dei Glossary of partner dance terms Sola fide Primitive Baptist Mary, the mother of Jesus Eastern Orthodox Church Schwarzenau Brethren Anglicanism Holy Orders John Wesley Charles Grandison Finney Music genre Elder (religious) William Carey Unitarianism Millerites Reformed churches United Church of Christ Ballroom dance Brethren Mormonism and Christianity Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith Tony Campolo Christian theological controversy Charles Darwin's views on religion Religion in Japan Dispensationalism Presbyterianism R.

people who learned to do a split question after you were able to do a pretty straight split were you able to kick really high like close to a straight line up down by mastering a split were you able to do a perfect cartwheel i practice my high kicks before i split so i actually think my kicks made my splits better but after you get that stretch from the split kicking feels a lot easier so i'd say splits help your kick too i think it's a two way street on that i've always done good cartwheels because it has more to do with strength and control than flexibility from mastering the splits  Aerial (dance move) Aikido Breaststroke Bass drum Chinese martial arts Poker jargon Martial art Front crawl Taekwondo Capoeira Swingout Wing Chun Hapkido Muay Thai Drifting (motorsport) Judo Theory of conduct Piccolo Junior Saga Extreme Programming Fast bowling Stud poker Lightsaber combat Double Dragon Backstroke Can-can Saxophone Strap-on dildo Glossary of American football Eagle Claw Shotokan Cheerleading Equine conformation West Coast Swing Weight training Offensive team Professional wrestling holds Drop kick Diving American football Liu Kang (Mortal Kombat) Charleston (dance move) Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Tenshinhan B-47 Stratojet Draw poker Rugby union positions Akuma (Street Fighter) Cross-country skiing Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Skateboarding trick Punt (boat) YuYu Hakusho Table saw Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Butterfly stroke Nigel Mansell Tai Chi Chuan Blood on the Tracks Goju Ryu Circle (dance move) Street Fighter New York Giants Guilty Gear Wu-Tang Clan affiliates Keynesian economics Snooker Wushu Dressage Rugby league positions Gangsta rap Pittsburgh Steelers Savate Body modification Football (soccer) Diocletian Pai gow poker Rope Ace-to-five low Toronto Subway and RT Connectionism Aladdin (1992 film) Internet Relay Chat IND Crosstown Line Omaha hold 'em Wild ARMs 2 Drawing Lindy Hop Democratic Party (United States) 24 Hours of Le Mans Horizontal bar The Apprentice 2 Harrow Football First World Martial Arts Championship Saga Knife Gymnastics American football strategy Crossword Asana Falconry

does anyone know of a dance class for children in kidderminster in worcestershire thanks my daughter would really like to go to a dance class so if you know of any could you let me know thanks go to this website and click on contact and ask for a list http www istd org main html they are a very reputable organisation and carry a list of recognised schools also look in your local yellow pages or on yell com but do be careful because dance teachers do not need to be qualified and although you might feel it is only for fun it is so important that the training is good because you are dealing with a growing body which does need knowledge in order not to force or damage the body so check out that the teacher holds some sort of recognised certificate if there is a dancewear shop in your area it doesn't need to be in your own town because people do travel for that kind of thing then they will know who is good in your area because they will supply all the dancewear for exams etc usually the dance shops are a mine of information and there is bound to be one in worcester  Irish dance Teacher HyperText Transfer Protocol Uniform Resource Locator Driver's license Cross site scripting Martial art Worcester World Wide Web Glossary of partner dance terms Ceroc Motion picture rating system Phishing HTML HTML element Education in Japan Requirements analysis Education in Germany Kidderminster Internet fraud Domain Name System Certification Pitaten Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus SAML WebObjects Lynbrook High School Trademark Lawyer Independent school (UK) Franklin W.

what is the right age for belly dance my girls r any age is right to start bellydancing my daughter started at one but it was in the home just like most people in the middle east the children learn it from their mothers aunts sisters cousins and even grandmothers it's never to early to start having fun with your kids but a formal class would probably be more productive when they are older if you can find a class for children then a younger age is fine but most bellydance classes are geared towards adults and will not be a very good match for such a young child they will be easily bored and frustrated in a class such as this and will likely become a nuisence to the other members of the class if you can't find a childrens class just do it at home with your kids for fun you may even want to buy some arabic kids music like free baby which will be easier for them to really get into kids especially love their song baba fein for adult classes children should be at least around years of age although some children mature faster or are more responsible and could be given exceptions  Child Belly dance Pride and Prejudice Our Gang About a Boy The Fairly OddParents Kodocha Baby Blues Kylie Minogue Generation Y Family Rugrats Neighbours Charmed Statutory rape The Adventures of Pete & Pete Spice Girls Mnemonic Transactional analysis Kimberly-Clark Corporation Little Snow Fairy Sugar Avenue Q Incest The Beach Boys Ellen Foster Melanie Wilkes Luke and Laura Spencer Cardcaptor Sakura Sheryl Crow Motion picture rating system Adolescence Emperor Cheng of Han Disney's California Adventure Murdock-Portal Elementary School For Better or For Worse W.I.T.C.H.

is it possible to start a dance career at the age of i am thinking of going into dancing i have always loved dancing though i had never gotten any formal training at all i have been going for some dance classes weekly for two months now with a guy who was in the original casting of fame the theatre show if i work really hard at it how soon could i be making a good living from it cheers becoming a pro in ballet at the age of would be very difficult but obviously not impossible people much older than you have done it based on what you said about your classes it sounds like you're more into jazz modern which opens a lot more opportunity for you you'll still have to work super hard but the heart of the dancer matters much more than its given credit for and it sounds like you know what you want if possible i would suggest trying to take more classes each week even if it means going to two separate studios see what kind of companies are in your area what studios may hire you as an assistant what kind of productions the local theatre district may need corps dancers for the more experience you can get and the faster you get it the better good luck  Jacob's Pillow Ballet Lindy Hop The Ashlee Simpson Show Gwen Verdon Tap dance Jazz The Jazz Singer Theatre The Chemical Brothers Musical film Jody Watley Janet Jackson Mickey Mouse Time Out of Mind Modern Western square dance Aerial (dance move) Dance Martial art Blood on the Tracks Ballroom dance George Burns Christian Death Glossary of ballet terms ABBA Fantasia (film) House music Hall & Oates Chicago (band) Beastie Boys Film Marching band Pow-wow English Country Dance Journey (band) Royal Danish Ballet Dance of the United States Luck Bj__rk Genesis (band) Royal Opera House Hollywood, Los Angeles, California En pointe Jazz dance Sound recording Fox Broadcasting Company Entr'acte Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Tony Bennett Madonna (entertainer) Rodgers and Hammerstein In The Groove (game) Marvin Gaye Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Ragnarok Online Queen (band) Spice Girls Music of Puerto Rico Henry Cow Fame Academy Prince (artist) Jennifer Lopez Participation dance Sergei Prokofiev Sylvia (ballet) Electronic music Phil Collins Emotions (album) Rod Stewart Glossary of partner dance terms Ruth St. Denis Stan Laurel Memphis, Tennessee Social rule Belly dance Grammy Award Dance of the Vampires Unemployment Circle (dance move) Music genre Logic Joy Division (band) Sarah Brightman Productive and unproductive labour Pittsburgh Steelers Kylie Minogue Fiddler on the Roof Canada's Walk of Fame Missy Elliott Guys and Dolls Roxette Swingout Pump It Up Funeral Birmingham, Alabama The Prodigy Sound design

i had an ankle injury in the spring how do i regain flexibility i fractured my ankle i was on crutches for almost months had a cast for weeks and a boot ankle brace for another weeks i am a cheerleader dancer and i cant land toe touches like i used to or even do the splits i'm doing some yoga and stretches but it's not helping me too much i want some help before the fall school starts and ill have to be prepared for try outs for teams any tips i have had injuries that have hindered my flexibility also but i've found that stretching and working out the area gets the mobility back best the key is slow don't rush it it will probably hurt some but you will get the blood flowing to the area and thus help with the healing also if you don't mobilize it it may freeze up here are some stretches that have helped me i realize that as a man and one who started to do the spits in my late s and as someone who is above averagely muscular always seems to cause a lot of surprise when i do the front splits i can t do the straddle splits yet but i m about from the ground at this point the reason that i bring this up is that i think anyone can do the splits even the least likely candidates like me and this is how warm up with some cardiovascular exercise i usually do the elliptical machine once warm the following stretches work really well sit with legs together and reach both hands until you have your feet in your hands keep your back as straight as possible breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds while seated bend one leg with foot back and away from body knee should be about degrees away from other straight leg reach for foot of straight leg breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds repeat with other leg lay on back with one leg straight pull other knee to chest with both hands breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds then pull same knee gently to the side until upper arm is flat on ground if it hurts stop breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds with hand of same side grab outside of foot palm down and pull towards body if it hurts stop breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds with both hands grab same part of foot and gently pull towards center and hold if it hurts stop breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds repeat other side sit back up and place foot of one leg flat to the outside of the knee of the other and rotate upper body so that you can put the elbow of the straight legged side to the out side of bent knee look behind you as you do this this one s a yoga move i just don t remember what it s called breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds repeat other side now put soles of feet together and as close to the groin area as possible grab the outsides of your feet together while knitting fingers use your elbows to push down knees keep back straight go as far down as you can with out pain in the knee if you feel any knee pain or pressure ease up or stop breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds from this position extend one leg so that knee of extended leg is against sole of foot reach for sole of extended leg s foot keep back strait and don t bounce breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds repeat other side now spread legs as far as comfortable reach towards center with back straight then reach for either sole with back as straight as manageable breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds for each side and center spread legs a little further if you can and repeat center lie on stomach and bring bent leg under body so that knee is close to sternum and back is straight and parallel to ground breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds from this position put palms on ground and push chest upward so that leg behind and upper body bend toward each other stretching abdomen a little breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds repeat other side after this you can attempt the splits a little but don t try to go all the way down it will take several months or more if you re super old like me but do not rush it or you may hurt yourself always make sure there is no undue pressure on your knees and or back and if there is stop immediately don t risk injury i wish you luck i apologize if the descriptions are hard to follow  Tai Chi Chuan Front crawl Anatomical terms of location Weight training Glossary of climbing terms Casualty lifting Swimming Clean and jerk

so you think you can dance who do you want to win personally i want pasha to win for those who wonder why i want pasha to win it's becuse first of all he is verry versital he danced beautifluly to every kind of style so far the only other person who come rometly close to that is neil but neil doesn't 'get into the part' as well as pasha does he always has the same look on his face in every dance i have to admit danny is good at ballet but thats it he always dances the same exact way the best dancer out of the girls is deffenetly sabra but she doesn't preform as gracefully as she should the other two girls blend in they just don't have what it takes to stand out and just because neil had one amazing preformance doesnt mean that he should win its about being the best throughout the entire season and im not just talking about the emotions in his face im talking about his attitude in general which has remained constant through the whole show krissy you seem to misunderstand the concept behind dance it is not all about technicality it is about overall performance connecting both the technical steps to the emotion while neil has excels technically he has only recently started to emit emotion but not enough that he is really giving a great performance same way with danny best technically but also until recently danced with no emotion pasha however is not the best technically he still out performs both of them the same was the case last season with travis and benji benji out performed travis plain and simple as far as the girls lauren seems to falter both technically and emotionally i think lacey and sabra will most likely be the top two but from there it could really go either way depending on the final performances i agree that silly faces and over expression in the face is often a problem something that has also plagued cheerleading as well i too have danced over years and have been teaching for and have found that i express myself best through dance too i find that most in the past weeks i have noticed quite an improvement in both danny and neil which is why i said until recently in the previous paragraph of neil and danny's performances have been vacant of emotion even from the eyes your right emotion doesn't have to mean silly faces or such and no i don't like overacting either and yes i agree that emotion can be felt everywhere in the body but they didn't seem to show it at all i also agree with you about the mia michaels piece from the other week i found the choreography was lacking but the vibe and story behind the dance and the emotion from lacey and neil made it beautiful krissy sorry to you if i came off attacking i was a bit offended from a previous post from you but i think we actually have quite alot in common from reading your profile almost shocking so and i would like to talk to you some more if you are interested respectfully yours joonday hotmail com  Glossary of partner dance terms Aerial (dance move) Emotions (album) Belly dance The Ashlee Simpson Show Dance I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Jon Secada Kylie Minogue Sharon Tate Friends Lindy Hop Contredanse Miss Saigon Marching band Boston Public Social rule The Amber Spyglass Little Britain Swingout Theory of conduct Garth Brooks Taxi Driver TLC Urinary incontinence Crazy in Love The Emancipation of Mimi Orlando Magic Irish dance Yoko Ono Asperger syndrome God Emperor of Dune Modern dance Janet Jackson Donovan Paula Abdul Madonna (entertainer) Whitney Houston ABBA Alex Ferguson One Tree Hill (TV series) Rod Stewart 1957 World Series Glossary of ballet terms Jennifer Lopez History of dance Princess Tutu Tupac Shakur Kasparov versus The World Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Tango (dance) Carpenters Galaxy Angel Sabra and Shatila massacre Saved by the Bell Vanilla Ninja Daria Scientology beliefs and practices Wonderland (McFly album) Ocean's Twelve Kim Possible: So the Drama Megan Griffin Child sexuality Compiler optimization Pok__mon Live!

do you think pregnant belly dancers look just as good dancing as regular belly dancers i'm pregnant and many of my bellydancing friends are happy that i'm continuing to dance because bellydancing is considered the fertility dance but i feel aqkward because i don't look like them and none of them are pregnant to talk about it to my husband says i look great but he's the one who sees me more than anyone else i want to know what someone who is seeing me for the first time would think of me dancing and being pregnant belly dancing actually originated in canaan as a series of exercises meant to strengthen muscles in order to ease the birthing process as you said it's the fertility dance i don't think it's distasteful or awkward at all it's only natural that a pregnant woman should dance the feritility dance of course if you feel awkward and it shows that will make the spectators feel awkward you might want to release your inhibitions before you dance again and don't listen to the guy above me locking away pregnant women during gestation and making them keep to their beds is an outdated victorian ideal pregnant women need plenty of exercising and a centuries old aroebics dance designed to ease birth will definitely make you and your baby healthier so keep dancing and congratulations on your new child  Pregnancy Breastfeeding Madonna (entertainer) Belly dance EastEnders Friends The Ashlee Simpson Show Childbirth Miscarriage Abortion debate Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Brave New World Obstetrics Cliff Richard Stuttering Marie Antoinette Pregnancy fetishism Repetitive strain injury Urinary incontinence Boston Public I Love Lucy Hathor Horus Transsexuality Exercise Multiple birth Aerial (dance move) Sex and the City Humphrey Bogart Mickey Mouse Birth control Melanie Wilkes Jam (TV series) Fecal incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jennifer Lopez English grammar Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Knots Landing The Beatles discography Britney Spears Premature birth Androgen insensitivity syndrome Lucille Ball Prenatal diagnosis Elephant Scottish country dance DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Puberty Menstrual cycle Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Abortion George Burns DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution The Prodigy Equine conformation Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Incarnations of Immortality The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Menstrual cup Family Guy Cytomegalovirus God Emperor of Dune Ron and Fez Koala Percy Bysshe Shelley Mission UK English Country Dance Yoko Ono Guinea pig Cat Married... with Children Joan Crawford Our Friends in the North Lindy Hop Tina Turner Woman DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution The McGuire Sisters My Family (television) Michael Jackson Pointe shoes Child sexuality Kodocha Nudity Breech birth Grandview, U.S.A.

please answer this i really want to be able to do my middle splits in a month and i was wondering if you guys knew any good stretches that i could do also i got my other type of splits in weeks and i only stretched for about minutes a day so how long do you think it will take me to do my middle splits ps i'm not fat i'm ' and lbs heya hopefully this will be of help to you please message me and let me know how you go steps stretch first do some lunges to get warmed up make sure you warm up properly though or else you could pull or tear a muscle and that hurts once warmed up sit with legs together and reach both hands until you have your feet in your hands keep your back as straight as possible breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds while seated bend one leg with foot back and away from body knee should be about degrees away from other straight leg reach for foot of straight leg breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds repeat with other leg lay on back with one leg straight pull other knee to chest with both hands breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds then pull same knee gently to the side until upper arm is flat on ground if it hurts stop breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds with hand of same side grab outside of foot palm down and pull towards body if it hurts stop breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds with both hands grab same part of foot and gently pull towards center and hold if it hurts stop breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds repeat other side sit back up and place foot of one leg flat to the outside of the knee of the other and rotate upper body so that you can put the elbow of the straight legged side to the out side of bent knee look behind you as you do this this one s a yoga move i just don t remember what it s called breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds repeat other side now put soles of feet together and as close to the groin area as possible grab the outsides of your feet together while knitting fingers use your elbows to push down knees keep back straight go as far down as you can with out pain in the knee if you feel any knee pain or pressure ease up or stop breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds from this position extend one leg so that knee of extended leg is against sole of foot reach for sole of extended leg s foot keep back strait and don t bounce breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds repeat other side now spread legs as far as comfortable reach towards center with back straight then reach for either sole with back as straight as manageable breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds for each side and center spread legs a little further if you can and repeat center lie on stomach and bring bent leg under body so that knee is close to sternum and back is straight and parallel to ground breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds from this position put palms on ground and push chest upward so that leg behind and upper body bend toward each other stretching abdomen a little breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds repeat other side after this you can attempt the splits a little but don t try to go all the way down it will take several months or more if you re super old like me but do not rush it or you may hurt yourself always make sure there is no undue pressure on your knees and or back and if there is stop immediately don t risk injury tips the key to this is repetition if you do it a lot one day and then don't do it again for days it won't work as well if you want the best results you must do this everyday i know it's hard but at the begginning try and stay on your heels when going down and have your knees facing the ceiling that way you'll be working on your turnout once you do get on the floor though roll forward so that your tummy is flat on the ground along with your groin and your knees are facing forward parallell with the ground this will give you a really good stretch if you cant get on the ground yet why not sit on your bum with your legs out in front of you and then pull your legs out to second as far as they will go then put your hand in front of you and reach for ward and pull yourself through this maybe hard i usually get my brother to pull my hand for me this is called rolling through the splits and gives a really great stretch really amazing but please make sure you be carefull coz it is easier to injure yourself in this and i dot want you do get hurt a very detailed and helpful resource for getting the splits down http drillobsession com fle things you ll need try using some padding underneath you because it makes the splits alot more comfortable but padding isn't required when i strtch i ussually do it on my bed because it doesn't hurt that much ad then once i'm done with the bed i do it on my wooden floor and i put two tea towels under my heel so that it is easier to slide i wish you luck i apologize if the descriptions are hard to follow if you do need any more help i am more than happy to be of assistance so message me or something mwah mwah xoxo twinkle toes p s i think the middle splits are harder than the others so i'm advising you do stretch fr more that five mins and stretch twice a day just as you wae up and before you go to sleep make sure you warm up first  Powerbomb Clean and jerk Glossary of American football Casualty

no i'm not fat but i need help with splits i'm trying to do the splits so i'm wondering how long does it take if you stretch for hour twice day to be able to do the splits that's what i do also what are some helpful stretches for the front back splits and stop answering with websites for diet pills i'm not fat i am years old am ' and i'm about something pounds firstly damn who ever called you fat you seem like a very normal wieght and being fat doesn't have a toll on splits anyone can do it i they really commit good on you for wanting to give it a try secondly your stretch routine is marvolous you seem very consistent and you are extrememly likely to reach your goal if you continue in this way congrats i actually dont know what the front back splits are we probably use a different name at our dance school do your mean the forward splits this is when you face one side hope fully the following tips wil help you get where you want steps warm up your legs by running jogging for about ten minutes beforehand so you don't pull a muscle stretch both of your legs with butterfly stretches and by touching your toes while standing there are several other stretches that are listed under these steps pick a few stretches a day and stay in each stretch for at least seconds get on your knees and put one leg straight in front of you to get into the split position bend at your waist slide down as far as you can go in the splits position and hold as long as you can use your hands on both sides of your legs to balance yourself once it hurts hold there for about one minute don't strain yourself but make sure that you're far enough to feel a stretch come back up and do some different stretches like touching your toes or seated butterfly stretches stretch everyday you will eventually achieve the splits after a few weeks if you are determined stay motivated and never give up continue stretching for minutes a day and you'll get there here are some stretches that will help you with the splits v sit sit with your back flat against a wall bring both legs as far back to the wall as you can and keep proper posture and straight legs while keeping your posture bring your back down towards the floor as your arms reach out in front of you not down as far as possible feel the stretch do this first pointing your toes then flexing your feet try moving your legs out further as you go on also you can reach out towards your right and left legs remember to breathe straight leg stretch i don t have a better name for this one basically keep your legs straight and feet together stand and without bending your knees reach down as far as possible put your weight on your toes not your heels this feels a bit unnatural at first but it is the proper way to stretch you can also do this one sitting sit with proper posture legs straight out in front of you and ankles together reach out with your arms do this both flexing and pointing your toes sideways stretch ok so you ve probably figured out that i m making up names for the stretches as i go along pretty creative eh anyway the sideways stretch goes like this stand in the straight leg stretch position now bring your right leg out in front of you like you re taking a step forward about two feet this doesn t have to be precise just as long as you re close stand up keep your posture back now reach down to your right foot keeping your posture back and your hips in line your hips shouldn t shift to aid you in your stretch go down slowly and if you hips shift come back up and try again go as far down as you can without shifting hips after doing this for a minute bend your left leg and continue stretching to your right now switch legs stretch named because it looks like a number sit down on your butt and put both legs straight out in front of you bend your left leg so that your left knee is on the ground your left foot also on the ground with the flat side touching your right knee and your right knee is straight with toes pointed see the that your legs make stretch with proper posture to your right leg reach out with your arms as far as you can after a minute remembering to breathe of course flex your right foot and continue reaching out for another minute switch legs and repeat standing v leg stretch stand up posture back with your legs shoulder width apart you can go a little wider if that s more comfortable for you but try to keep it as close to shoulder width as possible bring your straight arms between and beyond your legs reach back also reach to your right and left legs reach down the center too as with the straight leg stretch keep your weight over your toes rather than your heels half squat squat keep your right leg where it is and place your left leg straight out your left side toes pointed as if you were doing the center splits with your left leg put your right hand on the ground to the left of your right foot use your right elbow to push your right knee out you should feel stretching your inner thighs now flex your feet switch sides the splits well if you want your splits down shouldn t you be doing them never be discouraged by how far you are from the splits just get as close as you can and hold it there for awhile a minute relax and repeat a few times you can also do the splits on the wall preferably a doorway so you can keep your balance in a few days after doing multiple stretches you will notice that you re getting closer rejoice tips if you are fully touching the ground you can try putting your front leg on something elevated like a mat phone book or step wear loose comfortable clothing for most people splits are easier with a particular leg forward so try both ways practice keep trying and don't give up the splits are difficult to achieve but once you have them you'll be the envy of others who haven't accomplished it yet keep toes pointed for best result try a little bit every day if you push yourself too hard you can get hurt it is best if you try doing the splits a couple times a day the key to this is repetition if you do it a lot one day and then don't do it again for days it won't work as well if you want the best results you must do this everyday warnings do not stretch too hard you may pull a muscle do not hold any split too long if it hurts while you need to take the stretch to the edge of pain back off if you feel intense pain or feel something in your leg or hip give this can indicate injury if you are prone to muscle injuries talk to your doctor trainer or coach before attempting a forward split things you ll need try using some padding underneath you because it makes the splits alot more comfortable but padding isn't required when i strtch i ussually do it on my bed because it doesn't hurt that much ad then once i'm done with the bed i do it on my wooden floor and i put two tea towels under my heel so that it is easier to slide i wish you luck i apologize if the descriptions are hard to follow if you do need any more help i am more than happy to be of assistance so message me or something mwah mwah xoxo twinkle toes  Lindy Basic Milton H.

is it bad to want to go see girl strippers when your not homosexual i know that that's where a lot of today's most popular dances are originating i am curious to see what new ideas they've come up with aside from to regular grinding that we so typically see can't some of that be mixed with other movements to create a more entertaining style of dance than just sensual amdd you get the points for this one for pointing out the obvious struggles that some have with the english language but i also must give honorable mentions to amerye sarah kate and valkyrie for getting my question not every woman desires another woman it would be difficult to learn these types of techniques from a man since they typically don't manipulate their bodies in that sexy way i like the people who can't spell or conjugate verbs but still feel the need to bad mouth you you clearly stated you wanted to see what some trends are that's fine hell you could be into the ladies who gives a shit do what you want mama  Avenue Q Britney Spears German grammar Volleyball Nudity Shit Cliff Richard Transsexuality Lindy Hop Verlan Sexual orientation Non-native pronunciations of English Madonna (entertainer) Polish language Japanese language Stewie Griffin Indian English Profanity Scottish country dance Drum and bass Human sexual behavior Belly dance Naruto jutsu English grammar Hungarian language Gender role Slovak language Romantic music The Beatles discography Homosexuality and transgender Dance Dance Revolution EastEnders Striptease Wolof language Martial art Love Spanish verbs Kyle Broflovski Spice Girls Magic (illusion) Oral sex Homosexuality and Islam Figure skating Danish language Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Grammatical conjugation American and British English differences Newfoundland English Irregular verb Remix Japanese honorifics Crossword African American Vernacular English Kate Bush Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Beastie Boys Theory of conduct Feminism Greek language Milton H.

which is the best web address to find free belly dancing instruction please i'll love to learn belly dancing i would like to have opinions as to which ones are the best web pages where they show how to belly dance with photos pehaps videos etc any ideas will be much appreciated thanks so much the only real way to learn is to take lessons you cannot learn well from a video book or website here are some resources for you to look into keep in mind that anything other than an actual instructor is meant to be supplemental to your live instruction these materials are meant to enhance and reinforce what's learned if nothing else take beginners lessons so you at least know how to do the basics and then you will be able to learn from supplemental sources like videos books and websites much better websites for finding teachers classes http www shira net probably the most extensive directory http www middleeasterndance net my site which has a decent sized directory as well http www bhuz com another large directory as well as a great forum which can answer pretty much every question you will ever have about bellydance since it's comprised of bellydancers from all over the world if you can't find lessons looking on these three sites there may not be any in your area websites for learning moves on line http www middleeasterndance net my own site look under the movements section there will be enough to keep you busy for a long time also please read the before you begin section with the disclaimer warm up cool down and basics about posture http www shira net shira's site is an extensive collection of articles written about and for bellydancers and can provide you with a wealth of information that will be very beneficial it's one of the oldest and most respected sites on the internet and is referenced by bellydancers world wide she has a specific page which tells you how to do some moves as well as extensive links to other sites that offer on line lessons as well http www venusbellydance com vocabulary htm more movement descriptions http www aleena com miramar go to on line dance lessons there are several articles about dancing there http www zilltech com onlinelessons htm another old well respected website full of information you should check out she offers a few instructions for several basic moves http www kawakib com page html more of a technique lesson but might be helpful after learning some basics http www raqs co nz moves html has some descriptions of select movements books belly dancing basics by laura a cooper isbn x newer book not great but not bad either the art of belly dancing by dahlena with dona z meilach this book is out of print but shows up on amazon and e bay from time to time it's ok but it's written for a different time the history part is especially questionable but the moves are pretty straight forward grandmother's secrets by rosina fawzia al rawi isbn an interesting read has several descriptions of dance moves as well a lot of books have been coming on the market recently and most of them excluding out of print books are available at barnes and nobel or borders books as well as other chains and smaller stores on line instructional videos http www trybellydancing com like a mini instructional video available online it's not bad quality http www expertvillage com interviews egyptian belly dancing htm several mini instructional segments on various moves as well as zills costuming and musicality http bellyrolls com howtopage html more mini on line instructionals the video quality is a little poorer and not is clear to see but the instructional quality is decent videos precision motion workout series by suzanna del vecchio offers good posture basics as well as quality instruction on many moves bellydance for fitness series by neena and veena bidasher this series is very cheap and available from major retailers like target walmart borders and barnes and nobel but the quality of instruction is low this is more of a workout for beginner dancers who already have had some training the videos are a good quality as far as picture and sound but these are not good for an absolute beginner if you have any

excuse my salsa ignorance what really is the difference between on and on i know on is west coast and on is east but quite literally what do you do different and are the two different enough that if i don't know on and go to the east coast will i not be able to dance if someone asks again forgive my ignorance i have only been dancing salsa a short while and i am learning on the west coast so i guess i am learning on it's not entirely accurate to say that only the west coast dances on and only the east coast dances on or new york style on henceforth 'nyon ' i've found that on on and ny on are danced throughout the country i believe on to be the most popular timing used with nyon closing in fast and on a distant third see further below for a description of the basic step on these different timings besides the difference in timing which i believe may be your biggest hurdle what you will encounter is that there are several different styles of salsa as well in other words different timing doesn't necessarily make for a difference in style i categorize these different styles as follows ballroom colombian cuban la and new york however in the context of your question i will assume that you are referring to la style and new york style these are the differences between those two styles as i see them la mainly danced on but can also be danced on or ny on sharpness speed and precision are usually associated with this style it's a bit on the coarse side and it's known for incorporating lots of flashy dips and tricks if you frequent salsa clubs in la i'm sure you can attest to the fact that you'll see neck drops and the occasional girl getting flipped this is a great performance style but also a good social style of salsa la style is the most popular style worldwide this doesn't necessarily mean it's the best in the us it's obviously most popular in and around la but also throughout the rest country at the moment i would say that it's more popular than new york style in the us a few years back i would have said that it's definitely more popular but through the advent of salsa congresses new york style has surged in popularity and has caught up new york mainly danced nyon but also danced on or on this style is defined by smooth flowing motion with lots of personal style and body movement this is a great social style but also a good performance style of salsa good new york style dancers float around the floor while doing their turn patterns and shines this style obviously is most popular in and around nyc and the northeast of the us but as mentioned before it has surged in popularity throughout the country and is gradually gaining popularity in europe and other parts of the world as well timing on basic step the leader 'rocks' or 'breaks' forward with the left foot on count of the count steps in place with the right foot on count brings the left foot a half step behind the right on count holds on count rocks back with the right foot on count steps in place with the left foot on count brings the right foot a half step in front of the left foot on count and holds count on basic step aka power on or palladium style on the leader holds count rocks back with the right foot on count steps in place with the left foot on count brings the right foot a half step in front of the left on count holds on count rocks forward with the left foot on count steps in place with the right foot on count and brings the left foot a half step behind the right on count notice that the steps are identical to on except for the difference in timing you may also find that on is danced with the same foot pattern but the timing reversed such that the leader rocks forward on instead of nyon basic step leader brings left foot a half step behind the right on rocks back with the right foot on steps in place with the left foot on holds on brings right foot a half step in front of the left on rocks forward with the left foot on steps in place with the left foot on and holds on notice the difference in your foot position when you're doing the hold in puerto rico this foot pattern is used but the timing reversed such that the leader rocks forward on instead of as far as these styles are concerned they are constantly influencing each other so gradually the distinction between them become less and less obvious and you'll end up with a style that encompasses elements of both in fact the style of on that you're learning probably has some new york influences to explain this more clearly i'll offer you an example i'm an avid salsa dancer and have been for years i can dance either on on or nyon but i know that my style is predominantly new york because it's where i'm from when i switch from dancing nyon to on i don't pull out a whole new set of turn patterns or change my body movement or my shines i just change the timing so even though their will be some differences in the styles between the west and east coast your biggest hurdle is overcoming the difference in timing if you've trained your ears and body to listen for and react to the ' ' then dancing nyon will take some getting used but you don't have to start from scratch you just have to get used to the adjustment in timing  West Coast Swing Lindy Hop Contredanse Professional wrestling holds Side pass (dance move) Music genre Skateboarding trick

how can i keep pointe shoes from slipping off of the heels my daughters toe shoes were professionally fitted and seemed to work just fine the first few times she wore them they are her th pair now that they are broken in however they keep slipping off her heels can i fix this problem by repositioning the elastics or laces or should we return to the store which is a hour drive for us i'm not sure how you sew your ribbons or elastics on but my teacher makes us take a small piece of elastic and fold it in half into a loop and sew it on the top part of the back of the shoe so you have a little loop of elastic sticking out the top of the heel and when she laces her ribbons up have her stick them through the loop it will help keep the shoe attached in the back better and hold them up  Stocking Shoe Knitting Shoelaces Textile manufacturing terminology Glossary of climbing terms Equine conformation Undergarment Sock Climbing equipment Textile manufacturing Irish dance Earring Boot Sewing machine Gothic Lolita Screw Skinhead Black tie Professional wrestling holds Billiards Elastic Figure skating Snowboard Japanese tea ceremony Cowboy boot Mattress Knife Menstrual cup Footwear Violin Compiler optimization Marching band Tightlacing Professional wrestling match types Leggings Kurt Angle Professional wrestling slang Cowboy Comanche Strap-on dildo Kilt Necktie Sailing Fast bowling Clothing Shirt Shodo Lace-making Sewing Pole vault Loafers Tatting Cello Eddie Guerrero Boxing Softball Sailor fuku Dinghy Velcro Callus Sling (weapon) Pointe shoes Poker jargon Manifold Foot Corset Disentanglement puzzle Interchange (road) Bookbinding Glossary of ballet terms Flax Laptop Dental brace Lindy Basic Trapping Fencing Car handling Glasses Space elevator Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Potential energy Skateboarding trick Badminton Ski binding Battle of Spotsylvania Court House Hiking (sailing) Roller skating Escalator Collision detection Rubber IBM PC compatible Professional wrestling attacks Fixed-wing aircraft Characters in the Smurfs Snowshoe

really pointed feet how can i get my foot to be as pointed as this in ballet http www photoreflect com pr orderpage aspx pi ln w po c it's the one with the bright pink tights whose foot it sticking up really high and she has her tights rolled up it's photo first keep in mind that everyone's foot is different blah blah blah you may never be able to get your feet as pointy as someone else's because of the way the bones and tendons in your feet are arranged now stretches my favorite one to do is to sit on the ground with one leg stretched out straight in front of me then i just point my foot as hard as i can i try to get my foot to arch so that the ball of my foot is on the ground if you're just starting this or your feet aren't as bendy as mine try to get your toes to touch the ground make sure when you do it that you are stretching your toes not crunching them in order to get the point you'll feel it in the top of your feet near your ankle and in your arch plus a little bit in your calf hold it for thirty seconds then release and point your other foot other things you can do massage your arches while you're pointing it helps your feet relax so the position feels comfortable plus it helps you get a little more of a point pick up things like marbles and pens and such with your feet lie with your back on the ground knees bent so your feet are flat on the floor then lift your hips keeping some weight on the balls of your feet tendus are good for strengthening your arches releves and eleves are good for strengthening your ankles and calves edit i just realized you were talking about a different picture than your link goes to it looks like she's winging her foot which gives the illusion of extra point and extra turnout i'm not going to say whether or not you should do that because it's a style thing but if you decide to wing your foot in arabesques be careful because you're messing with your alignment only do it if your teacher choreographer wants you to  Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Equine conformation Professional wrestling throws Backstroke Figure skating Suplex Skateboarding trick Swingout Glossary of partner dance terms Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Weight training Horse Parade (military) Breaststroke Softball Glossary of American football Milton H.

above how about you me and my boyfriend had an stupid arguement about why people go to club he thinks most of the people go to club is to meet some body and to u know and that is why people dress up and go to club as for my answer i just like going to club to have fun i don't think there is something wrong with going to club with your friends even if you're in a relationship or not and as for dressing up because there is a dress code and who would want to look like a crap going to club maybe my bf is right on some parts but i don't think all people actually just go to club to meet somebody and get busy or is it different people go to clubs with different main goal in mind maybe his would be to meet someone yours is just to be in the loud crowd and get your energy level up as for dressing up dressing up makes you feel better it creates the mood but he has a point too if other guys come there with purpose to meet someone and get busy he's worried that you will be the subject while they might be pretending that they are there only to have fun and be in the crowd  Social rule Avenue Q Friends Human sexual behavior EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Big Brother UK series 6 Shaggy dog story The Ashlee Simpson Show Rock Follies Sydney Riot of 1879 Megan Griffin Craps Phoebe Buffay's songs Kodocha Piccolo Junior Saga FoxTrot Kyle Broflovski Marie Antoinette T.A.T.u.

is it too late for me to take ballet classes again i took ballet classes for five years from when i wa to when i was years old i stopped after my dance teacher got sick and couldn't teach anymore now i take latin ballroom classes so i havent been totally out of dance but im scared im not going to be very good at ballet anymore nervous about trying it again but at the same time i want to do it since ballet is a good foundation for technique well you didn't mention wanting to go pro so why would it be too late my studio offers a bunch of adult classes and they're full of people who are there for reasons ranging from cross training like you to wanting to get out and be active to just wanting to meet new people trust me if a fifty year old guy can take a class when he's never danced before in his life you can too anyway it might take some time to get your technique back but that's to be expected so what it'll come back and anyone who gives you grief for not being perfect right away is not someone i would take seriously  Glossary of partner dance terms Martial art Modern dance Ballroom dance Ballet Jacob's Pillow The Ashlee Simpson Show Lindy Hop Dance Kodocha Dog agility Past teachings of Prem Rawat Shaggy dog story Negima Time Out of Mind Scottish highland dance Timpani Alexander Technique West Coast Swing Columbia University Wang Chongyang Tai Chi Chuan Blood on the Tracks Avenue Q Stewie Griffin Education in the People's Republic of China Bart chalkboard gags Glossary of ballet terms The Fairly OddParents Circle (dance move) Jon Secada Contredanse Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Computer and video game genres Education in Germany Methos Le Malade imaginaire Professor YuYu Hakusho W.I.T.C.H.

dance ok so i have years of experience in ballet and i was wanting to start contemporary dance but i was wondering if it was a whole lot different than ballet like the clothing music etc if there are any contemporary dance studios in southern ohio ohh and could you also give me information about lyrical dance there is the contemporary classical dance theater in ohio not sure if it's southern but the website http www ohiodancetheatre org school staff faculty html there is the contemporary dance theater in cincinnati http www cdt dance org contemporary is very different from ballet it's most different from any other style of dance it's about expression so the music and clothes vary depending on mood and perception trying to be portrayed it's fun and free spirited but also hard and not fit for everyone for you however with a background of ballet i think you'll find it pleasant easy and a good way to expand you dancing horizon have fun and good luck fall classes start in sept answer to your second lyrical is my favorite always has been it's a good mix of ballet and jazz dance techniques as well as rock punk swing modern it's very expressional wikipedia has the best explianation the lyrics of a song are the driving force for the inspiration of the movement choreography is often emotional gripping and delicate all at the same time lyrical is not just a form of dance for many it is a way of expressing your emotions lyrical is typically dance to a song about freedom or releasing any sort of sad emotion but can be choreographed to any human emotion related song lyrical may or may not be graceful but always will be emotional and unpredictable this style of dance is generally not based on technique as are ballet and jazz on the contrary lyrical is based around choreography and the interpretation of the music routines are based around feeling and emotion and though technique is essential spirit generally tells where the dance will go movements in lyrical dance are characterized by their fluidity and grace leaps are executed high and with a soaring quality turns are airy and flowing when the music's tone is angry or frustrated dancers use sharp short movements anger is also an emotion often seen in lyrical in routines based around anger it is common for the jazz portions and styles of lyrical to come out however when it is happy or peaceful dancers use lighter more flowing movements very important in lyrical is the continuation of movements and moves this means that the dancer does not simply finish a move and be done a lyrical dancer would hold out the movement for as long as possible and have smooth transitions between others having used this continuation of movement the dancer may stop or incorporate sharp moves into their routine for emphasis although lyrical is stereotypically choreographed to music that is slow or downbeat it is a very broad form of dance upbeat aggressive styles of music are occasionally used music can be of any genre pop rock and even hip hop r b styles are popular for choreographing  Dance Aerial (dance move) Modern dance Glossary of partner dance terms Hip hop culture Jazz Blues Heavy metal music Music of Ireland American popular music Pop music Swingout West Coast Swing Music radio Musical film Music history of the United States Music Classical music era Fast bowling Marching band Romantic music Jazz dance Irish dance Postmodern music Ballroom dance Emo Hip hop music Funk Lead and follow (dance) Music of Germany Ska Freestyle music Folk music David Bowie Capoeira Music of the United States Gothic rock Bj__rk Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Timpani Popular music Music of Australia Martial art Violin Rhythm and blues Rapping Native American music Aikido History of dance Alternative hip hop Glossary of ballet terms Theatre Salsa music 20th century classical music Asperger syndrome Figure skating Jerome Robbins Swing (dance) The Ashlee Simpson Show Bradley Nowell Breakdancing Music of Louisiana Tonality Belly dance Double bass Musical theater Music of Cuba Jennifer Lopez Drum and bass Sylvia (ballet) Ballet Bass guitar Dance of the United States Punk rock Modernism Trip hop Anchor Nu metal Jethro Tull (band) Death rock Music of Nigeria Emotions (Mariah Carey song) Jacob's Pillow Mixtape Cantopop Music of Bangladesh Circle (dance move) African American music House music

how do i dance in a club as a guy i've been to a couple of clubs but most of the time it's just the girls dancing and the occasional creeper who pops in and starts grinding only to be left alone after the song is over besides just going with the flow what are some basic moves i could string together on the dance floor i've heard all it takes is confidence but i'd be a lot more confident if i had a better idea of what i was doing don't let your elbows out keep them close to your side it helps keep you looking less retarded or take a hip hop or break dancing class since that style of dance is more acceptable for males really the most important thing is to dance on beat with the music and don't overdo your movements but if you don't care how you look just dance how you feel you want to and have fun  Lindy Hop Swingout Aerial (dance move) Hip hop culture Glossary of partner dance terms West Coast Swing Hip hop music The Emancipation of Mimi Alternative hip hop Breakdancing Disc jockey Reggaeton Jennifer Lopez Charleston (dance move) Balboa (dance) Salsa (dance) Side pass (dance move) Freestyle music Lindy Basic Rhythm and blues Bemani Hollaback Girl Music of Puerto Rico We Belong Together House music The Chemical Brothers Kylie Minogue En Vogue 2Step Tango (dance) Lead and follow (dance) Drum and bass Contredanse Remix Scottish country dance Sampling (music) MTV2 Missy Elliott Glossary of ballet terms Hall & Oates Madonna (entertainer) Pop music Trip hop Whitney Houston Music history of the United States Circle (dance move) Usher (entertainer) Nu metal Prince (artist) Iggy Pop Latin American music The Isley Brothers Beastie Boys Music of the United Kingdom (1990s-present) American popular music Time Out of Mind The Beatles discography Herbie Hancock Equine conformation Rapping Jazz Modern Western square dance Canadian hip hop Music of Nigeria Social rule Jon Secada History of subcultures in the 20th century Toni Braxton Sugar push Tina Turner Hip hop rivalries Britney Spears Salsa music Rock (music) Music of Scotland Acid jazz Destiny's Child MTV Europe Music Awards Spice Girls Disco Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind James Brown (musician) Swing (dance) The Supremes Buddy Guy The Ashlee Simpson Show Professional wrestling aerial techniques Gwen Stefani Galaxy Angel Duran Duran African American music Fast bowling Beatmatching Professional wrestling holds Music of Hawaii Milton H.
