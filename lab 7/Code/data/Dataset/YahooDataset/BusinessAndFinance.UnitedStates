what would happen if the us went back on a gold standard and suppose the irs was abolished separate questions a for starters a new national economic equilibrium would need to be established which would for lack of better words be bad how lets say that hypothetically one ounce of gold equals one us dollar lets also say that this standard is established right now this very moment well taking into consideration the govt setting gold standards for every dollar issued and knowing the value of the us dollar value being what is backed by promise of the federal government as guarantee of repayment for goods and services and being that the dollar has no real or intrinsic value then two problems would arise the first being if every dollar in circulation was set against a gold standard backed by the federal govt inevitably massive inflation would take place as the amount of dollars required to make purchases would escalate through the roof why well think of it this way the government is in all reality a publicly traded company who issues stock in the form of currency like the value of any stock a stocks price is not based on what it is worth now rather it is presently valued to its projected potential or future value currency in the gold standard would be like having to buy stock in a company at its present value with conditions of solvency meaning that if its stock were sold today or tomorrow or whenever then every share of stock you had received bought would be entitled to an equivalent proportion of the historical equity share of the stock that was purchased this would work out relatively fine if you only bought into companies that were not in or ever were going to be in debt the government however is in debt and with a gold standard established we would see the per share value dollar buying power of the us 's stock currency fall as the government's debt increased this weakening of the buying power would initiate inflation why would this happen because the government under gold standards would still issue dollars be responsible for redemption of dollars and ultimately the most important factor be responsible for responsible fiscal budgeting as not to diminish the value of dollars in circulation which they back since a financial product is worth only as much as the company that backs it since the last of these responsibilities would be nearly impossible to perform and in order to compensate for the arising economic dis equilibrium more dollars would continuously be needed to purchase goods and services before we know it a gallon of gas would cost one hundred dollars remember we are talking about a gold standard which would be established through the global laws of supply and demand the only way to protect a standard once established is to preserve the status quo that would require elimination of fiscal deficit growth so what would happen internationally for starters we would begin to export more and more than we import since our dollar is weaker and products and services cost comparably less to other nations here is the contradiction most people don't realize with an increase in net exports which is exports imports comes less sources of domestic investment from foreign nations by way of selling them goods less imports equates to a reduction in industrialized growth when we export we sell a good the proceeds return as capital and then the other nation consumes it when we import we get to consume the good the nation that we bought from receives the capital in american currency then typically invest the american currency back into us firms in other words it is more beneficial to import goods which can be used in the factors of production while at the same time having the foreign nation providing capital for us investment and expansion caused by a deficit in our net exports why all of this net export info it all comes back to the value of the dollar in our hypothetical gold standard scenario when the dollar becomes weak our exports tend to rise as foreign nations spot the opportunity to buy goods at cheaper prices this is called the depreciation of the domestic currency relative to the foreign currency an exchange rate term that coincides directly with net export status either a deficit or surplus with our weaker dollar we tend to import less since goods cost comparatively more net exports surplus but remember when we import more we not only get the product but we also have the buying nation reinvesting their american dollars back into our economy stimulating growth in short as we lose strength in our dollar we end up running into a net export surplus which stifles domestic economic growth which generates less revenue for the government through taxes which causes the federal budget deficit to increase which cause a weakening of the dollar now true the fed can play around with interest rates and loans however their effect is short term nominal and does not effect long term growth conclusion our national fiscal policy has developed into a credit based financial system think of our economic situation as a necessary invention to create things that no amount of gold could have possibly accomplished the reason for our economic growth lies in the reality that a body the fed can print paper give it a number and make people work their whole lives to get more of it to try to limit the value of a currency by assigning it a standard would be back stepping remember america is a company currency is stock and america has tons of assets to say the least so just go along with the game even though we both know money isn't real and enjoy what it has provided b it would get sucked up by walmart

how do taxes work i am absolutely clueless i am but i just got a job i don't know how taxes work and my parents are too busy to ask if anyone could just give me some outlines on it all or a website i can go to and read on the subject i would be very much obliged at you are most likely still a dependent of your parents this means that you're still living at home and they are probably still mainly supporting you rather than you supporting yourself from your paycheck the employer will deduct for social security and medicare they might also take out money for income taxes they should have had you fill out something called a w when you started this tells them how much to take out for income tax you should have filled it out as single zero allowances if you are a dependent if you aren't going to make enough to owe any taxes you could also fill it out as exempt which means they won't take out anything for income tax but if you file as exempt and end up owing taxes you could have problems whether you'll owe income taxes depends on how much you make for the year if you make under you won't owe any federal income tax if any is deducted you can file a tax return and get it refunded to you depending on where you live you might or might not owe state or local income tax irs gov is the irs website and has tons of information but if you don't know what you're looking for it can be somewhat overwhelming  Taxation in the United States Social Security (United States) Flat tax FairTax Income tax Tax United Kingdom corporation tax 401(k) Progressive tax Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 H-1B visa Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus U.S. Internal Revenue Service Tax protester United States Postal Service Microeconomics Tax credit Tax avoidance/evasion Gross domestic product George W.

what exactly is unearned income i was recently injured at work i have just now started to receive my workers comp checks last night my boyfriend mentioned something about unearned income on my taxes something about the money i would have earned if i was not injured i am confused i know that generally it means interst from accounts and stuff like that but is there some credit or something for my situation i really dont think so but would like to get another opinion unearned income is income received without providing personal labor or services on your part such things as dividends interest rents royalties capital gains etc are all examples of unearned income workers compensation payments could be classified as unearned income but more importantly it is non taxable income you won't pay any income taxes on the wc payments so any classification of them as unearned income is a moot point under the law it's neither earned income nor unearned income but non taxable income where it would impact some taxpayers is when it comes to calculating the earned income credit any amounts received under a state wc plan would not count as earned income for the eic calculation on the other hand it would not count as unearned income which can disqualify you from the eic entirely if it's high enough or as part of your adjusted gross income which again can disqualify you from the eic if it's high enough if you are collecting wc payments there is no imputed income based upon what you might have earned had you not been injured your payments are fully tax free see irs pub page  Taxation in the United States Tax United Kingdom corporation tax Flat tax FairTax Social Security (United States) Income tax Dividend Gross domestic product Measures of national income and output Dividend imputation Microeconomics 401(k) Surplus value Insurance Compensation of employees Annuity Income trust Mutual fund Life insurance Productive and unproductive labour Tax avoidance/evasion Unemployment benefit Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social Security debate (United States) Personal finance Inheritance tax Bond Municipal bond Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Wealth condensation Capital gains tax Double taxation Tax protester Economic inequality Anarchism and capitalism U.S. Internal Revenue Service Operating surplus Consumer price index Credit card Value added Minimum wage Workers' compensation Derivative (finance) Pension Income Article One of the United States Constitution Intermediate consumption Variable universal life insurance Economy of the United States Inflation Earned income tax credit Anarchist economics Capital accumulation United States Postal Service Tom DeLay Tax deduction Individual Savings Account Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Economy of Russia Property tax Corporation Student loan Health insurance Value added tax Jizya Mortgage Labour (economics) Taxation in Canada Payroll Tax cut Deflation (economics) Income statement Corporate finance Tertiary education fees in Australia Reaganomics Child support National Insurance Usury Keynesian economics Value product Government debt Debt Bretton Woods system Money Social Credit Tariff Self-employment Economic rent Profit Cost of capital PE ratio

what do you think about taxes america was built on the foundation of being tax free we even threw a tea party over it back in the day now however people have houses taken from them inheritances taxed so greatly they lose everything i knew a farmer who died and left his land to his three sons they had no money and nothing besides the land they worked on all their lives the government came and told them the value of the land for inheritance tax they were unable to pay it and lost everything not every case is as big as this but it is important you realize this happens everyday any working american is taxed losing about of what they make before they even are paid we are a nation with a high poverty level while politicians and government officials live with all the luxeries we need to realize this as a country what does everyone else think jefferson said the government that governs best governs least yes there is a need for some things but we are paying for much more than a clean country and roads to get to work in my opinion there should be no b s takes like inheritance property etc but just enough to keep our great country alive without making politicians rich and the rich near untouchable after hearing a few opinions i think most would agree but i want to hear all your voices not just a few americans but america as a whole and beautiful country i love the land we live in but it is dire need of reform and in more areas than just taxes i never said they taxed it i simply said they could not afford to keep the land their father left them which they worked on all their lives i know them personally and while are still struggling on after this happened years ago one the youngest couldn't live with it anymore the world is not about money but love and family above all else if you can't see that what do you have in your life as for history taxation without representation is exactly what i am talking about you speak for one group but what of the rest of us we certainly don't feel properly represented to answer even more questions and statements the world census is not by far accurate but set at numbers which have to be approved also the level they judge poverty at is also wrong a family must make at least a year to support both parents and children that is bare minimum poverty level is set at about per family or aprox k for each parent look at those numbers and tell me what the real poverty level is most estates do not pay an estate tax since the federal limit is currently we didn't revolt because we wanted to be tax free we revolted because taxes were being passed left and right without any consultation of the persons being taxed i do agree that the current tax system is not fair with all the tax loopholes and gifts to favored donators but right now it's all that we have to work within if someone has a more fair way of taxing please let's hear it  Property tax Flat tax Tax U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 FairTax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Parliament of the United Kingdom Separation of church and state United Kingdom corporation tax Life insurance Microeconomics Capitalism Inheritance tax Liberalism Shaggy dog story Knots Landing Annuity Hillary Rodham Clinton Order of succession Democratic Party (United States) Miss Saigon Minimum wage Insurance Plame affair Value added tax Progressive tax Canadian federal election, 1993 Politics of Canada California government and politics Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Rent (musical) Liberal Democrats (UK) Avenue Q Originalism Publicly funded medicine Tom DeLay Article One of the United States Constitution Education in England Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an British House of Commons American Revolution Campaign finance reform Free trade 39th Canadian federal election First Amendment to the United States Constitution Free market Simone Weil Libertarianism Corporate personhood Rick Santorum Bretton Woods system Social Security (United States) Live 8 Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Democracy Allodial title House of Lords Estoppel Ten Commandments Pitaten History of the United States (1789-1849) Corporation United States Federal government of the United States Education in the United States Craps History of the United States Constitution Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Szlachta 2004 Democratic National Convention Agricultural policy One Tree Hill (TV series) Child support Tax protester Unreformed House of Commons American Conservatism Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Socrates Wal-Mart Robert Walpole Mumia Abu-Jamal United States Constitution School choice Primogeniture Economy of the United States Autism rights movement Court system of Canada Past teachings of Prem Rawat Economy of India Canadian and American politics compared 2005 trial of Michael Jackson

when it comes to taxes why wouldn't this work i have wondered when i go to work and finally get my paycheck we all notices the large chunk missing from taxes most everyone agrees that it stinks working for that money then have it taken away by the gov why does no one ever try and do it the other way around why cant the gov tax people on what they spend it seems like it would balance out if they left my work check alone and raised taxes on products we buy like food mountain dews the gas station just whatever why would that not work you could even tax things like ciggz and alcohol more than every day products but it seems like by raising sales tax and letting the worker keep their paycheck without taxes being taken people could save more money and be taxed for the things they buy if they dont buy alot then good for them they get to save up some money it just seems to me it would balance out if you just flipped it around i guess i feel discouraged to buy things when i do not have much of a paycheck i think i would feel more like saving or buying more things if i felt i had the money to do so those of us that are middle class or poor would pay a greater share of our income in this type of tax since we have less income than the rich do they would be buying the necessities just like we do and paying the tax on them but they'd still have much money left over to do whatever they wanted with compared to the middle class and the poor  Tax FairTax Progressive tax Microeconomics Flat tax Capitalism Gross domestic product Taxation in the United States Value added tax Mutual fund Inflation Anarchism and capitalism Trickle down effect Economic inequality Deficit spending Keynesian economics Surplus value Economy of Russia 401(k) Canadian and American economies compared Free trade Economy of the United States Social Security (United States) Health insurance Price discrimination Credit card Supply and demand Outsourcing Life insurance Income Tax cut Islamic banking Publicly funded medicine Deflation (economics) Public transport Economy of India Betting (poker) Economy of Norway Great Depression Economy of Pakistan Measures of national income and output Public policy Commodity Galactic Civilizations Money Gold as an investment Make money fast Tax bracket Unemployment Tariff Internet fraud Wal-Mart Warren Buffett Hyperinflation Regressive tax Ocean's Twelve Biodiesel History of the United States (1918-1945) Anarchist economics United States Postal Service Reaganomics Wealth condensation Social class Security (finance) Tax resistance New Deal United Kingdom corporation tax Labour economics History of the United States (1980-1988) U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Article One of the United States Constitution U.S. public debt Debt Insurance Protectionism Apprenticeship Supply-side economics Externality Road pricing Personal finance Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Unemployment benefit Arguments for and against drug prohibition Marshall Plan Wealth Guaranteed minimum income Compensation of employees The Amazing Race Primerica Financial Services Conker's Bad Fur Day Short selling Economy of Africa Labor theory of value Bulk vending Knots Landing Social Security debate (United States) Ethical consumerism

is it cheaper for employers to use direct deposit for payroll temp agencies have them so why can't casting agencies for background actors in hollywood do the same sure it's cheaper no checks to print no employee coming to the boss and saying i lost my check can i get a replacement less hassle for payroll dept no uncashed checks that if they are uncashed long enough are considered abandoned property and are supposed to be turned over to your state dept of revenue the only problem using it for casting agencies for background actors is that there is probably so much turnover of the background actors that it isn't worth the time to set up a person for direct deposit especially if they are here today and gone tomorrow  Tax Taxation in the United States Payroll Money supply Outsourcing Social Security debate (United States) Bank fraud FairTax United States Postal Service Microeconomics Inflation Economy of the United States Oakland Athletics Mutual fund Cheque C programming language Credit union Money Humphrey Bogart Unemployment benefit Our Gang 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Bluetooth Boston Red Sox Classified information Timesheet Food and Drug Administration Annuity The Simpsons United States House of Representatives Wal-Mart Child support Doctor Who missing episodes Public domain Toronto Blue Jays Police Halting problem Plame affair Walt Disney World Resort Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Abstraction (computer science) Soap opera Separation of powers Plastic Blackjack Security clearance Screen Actors Guild The Riordans Human resource management system CPU cache United States Senate Efficiency wages Surplus value Health savings account Sheriff Collision detection Economy of Russia Mary Pickford System/34 All My Children Elections in Malaysia Social Security Administration 1994 baseball strike Procrastination Accounts payable Computer Air America Radio System/36 Drug test Cerritos, California Chemical shift Citigroup Quantum computer Security (finance) Pennsylvania Salary cap Relational algebra Automated Clearing House Arlington County, Virginia Asset New Deal Triad Filmmaking Pseudonym Objectivist philosophy Embezzlement Great Teacher Onizuka Economy of India National Insurance Strategic Petroleum Reserve Doublespeak Security guard Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Richard Cromwell (actor) Railroad switch Diablo II: Lord of Destruction

help my former boss won't pay me i was working at a small teddy bear store and was let go because the buisness is not making any money and they are going to get out of their lease i was let go weeks ago when i was working there my boss would never pay me on time and my schedule would always be given to me in the middle of the week right now i am owed over dollars and he is giving me the run around he told me he would have my money last monday that never happened then he said wednesday and that never happened then today he told me he would have it tonight at closing i come in and he is not even there i contacted him through text and calls and he is ignoring me i contacted his father who owns the buisness and he told me that i will be paid tomorrow but i am getting very concerned because i am leaving on monday to new york for two weeks my boss never filled taxes on me even though i told him repeatedly that i have my s s n and everything for him what are my options if his father does not give my money tomorrow thank you in advance tell your former boss that if you don't have your money by a certain day within a few days that you are going to call your state department of labor then if you don't get the money go ahead and make the call the better business bureau will put a report on file against him if you report him so anyone who calls and asks can hear that he has had a complaint filed but if they are getting out of their lease and going out of business that won't really mean anything bbb is more for customers to use not employees it sounds like he doesn't have the money and that's why he's not paying you i'm guessing this from what you said about getting paid late before and their not making any money and if he doesn't have it you might have to get in line with other creditors if he files bankrupcy or something and your chances might not be real good of getting your money did he withhold any taxes from your wages if he did then it's hard to tell if he sent them to the irs like he should have i hope you kept your pay stubs you'll need to talk to the irs before filing if he doesn't give you a w if he didn't deduct any you'll still need your own records to file your taxes good luck on getting your money but this doesn't sound good  Wal-Mart Taxation in the United States Flat tax Wheel of Fortune Ocean's Twelve Poker jargon Tax protester FairTax 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Tom DeLay Plame affair Ken Jennings Surplus value Supply-side economics Social Security (United States) Progressive tax Animal Crossing Internet fraud Outsourcing Economy of the United States Tax EastEnders Social rule 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Paul Hackett Capital accumulation United Kingdom corporation tax Annuity Enron Corporation U.S. Internal Revenue Service Child support Microeconomics Major League Baseball television contracts Income tax 401(k) Islamic banking Citigroup Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Timeline of the Enron scandal United States Postal Service Alex Ferguson Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Health insurance National Football League Neighbours Minimum wage Badly Drawn Kitties Live 8 Infidels Pitaten James T.

can a contractor collect unemployment i understand that employers do not pay federal income taxes for their contracted employees does this mean that i cannot collect unemployment if i need it my last contracted work was a six month contract in the state of california this six month project was my very first contract i havn't paid my own taxes as of yet i know it's something i should have done quarterly and i still need to take care of it this year sounds like i am inelligible huh you can apply for unemployment compensation and a determination will be made after your application is reviewed you must meet other qualifications to be eligible you must have adequate quarters prior to your six months of work you are considered self employed during that time the reason you left your job prior to your self employment is also a factor you apply for unemployment compensation in the state you are currently living even if you worked in california if you are still in california here is the link to your state http www edd ca gov uirep uimer htm you may be eligible as a self employed individual but it depends on whether your self employment has been ongoing in nature and whether it is likely to continue as ongoing if you only had months of self employment with that alone you will not qualify for benefits according to ca statutes see section thru section http www leginfo ca gov cgi bin waisgate waisdocid waisaction retrieve if you have a history of self employment and you do not intend to end that type of work then your month contract in ca will help your claim edit to answer your additional details you should file a claim and see if you are allowed unemployment compensation based on your previous employment from what you have described the pay from your month contract wouldn't be eligible to be included in your base year wages in california self employment will qualify some workers for unemployment compensation but unfortunately not in your case ps figure your taxes including se taxes early so you aren't shocked come april send in your quarterly payments as soon as you can to reduce the late payment penalty  Unemployment benefit Taxation in the United States 401(k) Life insurance United States Postal Service Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social Security (United States) Unemployment Tax National Insurance Minimum wage United Kingdom corporation tax Article One of the United States Constitution Microeconomics Insurance Food Stamp Program Centrelink Wal-Mart Labour economics Immigration to the United States Divorce Efficiency wages Economy of Russia Inflation Affirmative action Student loan Flat tax Domestic partnerships in California Annuity Economic inequality Keynesian economics Copyright law of the United Kingdom Health insurance Employment in Hong Kong Paid Family Leave FairTax Tax protester Plame affair Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Workers' compensation George W.

how does doing independent contractor work factor into my unemployment benefits my position was recently eliminated i am deciding whether to request unemployment benefits for just a little bit until my next job i have many student loans and in order to keep up with the payments on these i would work various small jobs on the weekends in which i was paid via check but it was for different companies and always way under so nothing was ever reported this income was not taken into account in determining what weekly unemployment benefits i would receive if i continue to work these contract jobs will i have to report them and have them deducted from my unemployment benefits i will report them at the end of the year on my taxes but how will the unemployment agency find out about them they do not prohibit my typical employment of as they are on the weekends and how will the unemployment agency be able to determine the exact dates that i worked a couple weekends if the agencies most likely won't even report this income please help thanks i said my original position was eliminated i had a regular full time salary job i am not avoiding taxes at all i said i was going to be paying them in i am saying that since my independent contractor work has been going on for awhile in order to pay for my student loans and since the unemployment office doesn't take this into account in order to determine my unemployment benefits i already know i qualify based on my regular salary do i have to report it to the unemployment office it's only about every other week and i'd only be on unemployment weeks max again i already said i would obviously be paying taxes on all the work come april as i did last year i know that independent contractors are totally away from the unemployment system i was a full time regular employee for years before this on the side i also did some independent contracting work that was never reported on behalf of those employers to the state but i reported it on behalf of tax purposes and was taxed on it every april however i am wondering when i receive my unemployment benefits from my seven years of salaried work will my random independent contracting work need to be reported to the unemployment agency as i have always needed this work to continue to pay for past student loans and living expenses in the past and still do now as i was just laid off i will still pay taxes on this come next april i just want to know if i have to report it to the unemployment agency thanks so much ok thanks so much for the last answer i wasn't trying to get away with anything just wondering if it's considered separate by the unemployment agency also what is reported on a thanks again ok i realize that now i was just wondering and didn't know thanks to everyone who answered i just realized that i believe i won't be eligible for unemployment benefits though because of what my employer has entered into my k plan he fully contributed of my income every year and i think according to my state that this constitutes a deduction as far as to the benefits i can receive and what my employer contributed to my k right now pre tax and penalties outweighs my maximum unemployment benefits does this make sense or sound right state law determines unemployment benefits but generally an independent contractor does not pay into the unemployment system therefore your benefits will only be calculated on the work in which you were the employee of someone who paid unemployment insurance for you  Social Security (United States) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 401(k) United Kingdom corporation tax Life insurance Insurance National Insurance Annuity Unemployment Tax Student loan Flat tax Compensation of employees Health insurance FairTax Wal-Mart Pension Minimum wage Centrelink Payroll Child support Salary cap Gross domestic product Microeconomics Professor Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Health savings account Article One of the United States Constitution Credit card Social Security debate (United States) Capitalism National Football League Mortgage Employment Education in the People's Republic of China Variable universal life insurance Contract Trade union United States Postal Service Primerica Financial Services Income tax Publicly funded medicine Welfare trap Graduate school Hartz concept Labour economics ITV Canadian House of Commons George W.

differing amount of prop tax escrow vs assessor site we pay our property taxes along with our mortgage and the amount listed on our monthly statement is considerably higher roughly than what is listed on our county's tax assessor website for our address' estimated taxes which includes city school county college and hospital why would these numbers differ are we paying too much by some oversight during our mortgage process thanks our insurance is payed as well but listed separately so it's not included in the tax amount the mortgage company uses an estimate of the taxes you will owe the main factors influencing that estimate are last years tax bill and the estimated value on the property if the tax rate has changed for any reason one of the numbers you have may reflect the new rate and the other could still be based on the old rate mcmufin was not quite correct about any difference being applied to the principle or refunded to you in most cases any excess will reduce the escrow portion of your payment when they recompute it for the following year you still don't lose the money but it is returned in the form of a lower monthly payment  Taxation in the United States Life insurance Mortgage Insurance Tax FairTax Bond Annuity Property tax Credit card Social Security (United States) Microeconomics Health insurance Publicly funded medicine 401(k) Personal finance United Kingdom corporation tax Inflation Mutual fund Security (finance) Student loan Primerica Financial Services Deflation (economics) Economy of Russia Inheritance tax National Insurance Social Security debate (United States) Capitalism Debt Capital gains tax Corporation Estoppel Islamic banking Unemployment Government debt Tax resistance U.S. public debt Advance fee fraud Income trust Donald Trump Gold standard Appeal Dividend Supply-side economics Government National Mortgage Association Money Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Gross domestic product United States Postal Service Bank Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania Auto insurance Derivative (finance) Credit score Education in the United States Surplus value Interest Income tax Medical malpractice Unemployment benefit Monetary policy Capital accumulation Keynesian economics Blackjack PE ratio Monopoly (game) Tax credit Value added tax Variable universal life insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Allodial title Intellectual property Politics of Canada Reaganomics Law of value Supply and demand Collateralized mortgage obligation History of the United States (1918-1945) Compensation of employees Monopsony Medicare (Canada) Child support Subsidy Real estate bubble Productive and unproductive labour Salary cap California Proposition 13 (1978) Municipal bond Price discrimination Central processing unit Tax bracket

essentially i am looking for significant yet sensible approaches areas for business tax deductions tax deductions generally come when earnings are reinvested back into the businesses based on projections the year should end in a k to k net profit this incorporates costs a maximum ira w tax code section in play a business can deduct k w in a single tax yr rather than via the typically longer multi year depreciation process new equipment purchases should absorb k this in turn will allow the business to act on the benefits of section efficiently utilizing the remaining k is the challenge developing exercising viable legitimate investment deduction opportunities is in a sense the goal most ideally i had hoped that the additional funds could serve as a business investment in the form of a business property down payment i e for a new corporate office a balloon down payment to my understanding however can not be as in section taken as a deduction entirely w in the same year i am requesting feedback on the topic and i hope that those with stronger backgrounds experience will shed light on my self and the group clever above board strategies that promote tax deductions are certainly welcome assuming your are owner you should not be limiting yourself to an ira if you have annual profits of greater than k talk to your accountant immediately to find out your options regarding implementing a k plan with profit sharing or maybe even a defined benefit plan if you employ yourself and maybe just a few others under a good plan you should be able to put away at least mulitple times the ira limit how much were your new asset additions i would suggest calculating your tax depreciation even with sec you get macrs on the remaining depreciable basis as this could be another large hit a purchase of a new building would give you additional depreciation but not any write off expense the most practical business advice would be if you have k in profit and are looking to spend you must have the k in cash lying around rather than looking for ways to spend it to save a few dollars in taxes look for ways in your business to reduce future costs often times i see company's blowing money to save tax when they could use the cash to pay down debt and save money on interest if you don't have debt but have the extra cash you are probably in cash cow status now which is why the retirement options are your best bet to defer tax additional note with regards to closely held flow through entities which i'm assuming this is retirement contributions have a lot to do with business profits as while putting money aside money for shareholders and eligible employees you are reducing your tax liability i assume based upon your comments this is what you meant when you mentioned maxing out ira  Variable universal life insurance Corporation Surplus value Credit card Income statement Pension Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Corporate governance Wal-Mart Mergers and acquisitions Security (finance) Flat tax Monetary policy Social Security debate (United States) Gross domestic product Enron Corporation Bond United States Postal Service Mortgage Inflation Food Stamp Program Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bank Derivative (finance) Money Privatization Stock Finance Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Deflation (economics) Trust (Law) USA Profit Debt Bretton Woods system Risk management Productive and unproductive labour Progressive tax Capital gains tax Measures of national income and output Reaganomics Short selling Intellectual property Gold standard Health savings account Primerica Financial Services Hyperinflation Institutional fund management Poker jargon Strategic management Law of value Sport utility vehicle Ra (board game) Health insurance Interest Government debt Manitoba Hydro Retirement plan Citigroup Publicly funded medicine Economy of India Student loan Operating surplus Leasing Minimum wage Anarchism and capitalism Supply-side economics Value product Accounting methods Economic inequality PE ratio Dot-com Bank fraud Real estate developer Registered Retirement Savings Plan Money supply

tax questions i just started a job for a carrier or messenger company where i use my own car for my job what can i get back at the end of the year what receipts should i keep i do live in california if you keep a mileage log that supports the business miles not commuting you can choose to deduct cents mi or apportion your actual expenses based on business total mileage when you pick one method over another you are stuck with that method for the life of the car once you calculate the deduction it will flow through to schedule a of your return less of your agi assuming you already itemize and make say you would need to rack up mi before you reach any benefit though tax prep fees and a few other deductions can offset the level i would suggest your talk to your employer regarding an accountable reimbursement plan even if it means your salary is less it maybe worth having your employer require you turn in mileage logs on a monthly basis from which the company reimburses you at a standard rate if the rate is above cents mi the excess is w income if the rate you are reimbursed is less the difference can go to schedule a these reimbursements under an accountabl plan are not part of your w income so it essentially gives you a deduction without the hassel remember though under an accountable plan the employer must only reimburse you for supported expenses not a flat rate of a month any such plan would result in the entire amount being wages no matter what your turned in if you need to sell your employer on implementing an accountable plan point out that by doing so the employer will save money on employment taxes but still get the business deduction of what leaves the company's checking account this benefit is of course only if the employee's wage is lowered to account for the reimbursed mileage  Tax Insurance FairTax Taxation in the United States Flat tax United Kingdom corporation tax Microeconomics Social Security (United States) Gross domestic product Credit card 401(k) Inflation Publicly funded medicine Life insurance Annuity Food Stamp Program Social Security debate (United States) Auto insurance Primerica Financial Services Income tax Health savings account Warren Buffett Hybrid vehicle Reaganomics Value added tax Wal-Mart Monetary policy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus United States Postal Service E85 Supply-side economics National Insurance Student loan Minimum wage Income trust Mutual fund Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Health insurance Progressive tax Labour economics Personal finance Mortgage Surplus value Labor theory of value Unemployment Dividend Gold standard Income statement Education in the People's Republic of China Supply and demand Measures of national income and output Solar cell Capitalism Employee stock option Principal-agent problem Economic inequality National Kidney Foundation Singapore Outsourcing Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Arthur Laffer Arbitrage Airline Government National Mortgage Association Cost accounting Taxicab Accounting methods Efficiency wages Affirmative action George W.

can the irs take away your home if you aren't paying taxes as bostonian and several others have said the short answer is yes however that will be an absolute last resort they will attach a lien on it so you wouldn't be able to sell it until you settled your tax liability usually irs agents can be tough but if you treat them with respect and don't get upset and make a good faith effort to pay your taxes things will turn out ok btw you can ignore the tax protestor who says tom cryer proved the tax had no legal grounds he's wrong tom cryer was acquitted of willful failure to file charges which is a criminal charge the burden is on the prosecution to prove the defendant cryer knew they had a responsibility to pay taxes if the defendant can successfully convince the jury that he believes there isn't a law the jury must acquit it doesn't matter if his belief is correct or not this is one of the few situations where ignorance of the law is an excuse however civil proceedings will be following and there is nothing stopping the irs from placing a lien on any property that tom cryer may have besides his acquittal does not prove there is no legal basis for income taxes anymore than o j simpson's acquittal proves it is o k to kill your ex wife all of stormdevil's other comments are also equally frivolous good luck  Tax protester Jury trial Double jeopardy Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Taxation in the United States Slander and libel Tom DeLay Plame affair Theory of conduct Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus FairTax 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Ronald Goldman Scots law Conspiracy Kent Hovind Burden of proof Microeconomics Criminal procedure Allodial title Tax Philosophical skepticism Flat tax 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Lawsuit Mortgage Apology (Plato) Hillary Rodham Clinton Wyatt Earp Ronnie Earle Hearsay Mumia Abu-Jamal Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Karl Rove Scientology and the legal system Abortion debate Theodicy Evan Mecham Insurance United Kingdom corporation tax 2004 Democratic National Convention ROC presidential election, 2004 Property (ownership right) Trust (Law) USA Atheism Separation of church and state Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Equal Protection Clause Tax resistance Domestic violence Motion (legal) Insanity defense Concurrent estate The Bill Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Criminal law Due process Tort reform Religion Law Corporation Jury Rick Santorum Presumption of innocence Tort Utilitarianism U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Evidence (law) Arguments for and against drug prohibition Criticism of libertarianism Non-aggression principle Fathers' rights Scientology controversy Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Bill Clinton Jim Bakker New Hampshire Supreme Court National Kidney Foundation Singapore Moore v.

i have a tax related question please advise i have stocks i received from my father over the years and would like to use it to purchase a home perhaps years from now should i be selling it over the years to break it up or can i just sell it all as one lump sump before i decide to buy what are the pros and cons of each approach thanks sounds like there are few issues here that are rather complex because your issue is a related to a year future purchase of home tax law may change price of stock may change the stock you received was it a direct issue or is it attached to an entity for example a estate was the stock from all the same company is the stock held by you or is the stock held by the brokeage firm will be important to determine the purchasing price the other issue is the performace of the stock if the stock is performing very poorly it may be wise to sell it and convert it into something performing better or if it is stock from various companies there maybe loses that can offset some of the gain is the stock a high risk stock is the stock in ira plan what is your tax bracket now and your projected tax bracket and etc i would not be doing you a favor by suggesting any course of action when so many factors are unknown consider consulting a financial planner one that is a fee service planner not one that gets commissions on selling stock or a tax planner on this issue that you can provide the information to in detail and they can provide you a few options on courses of action i wish you well  Mutual fund Insurance Bond Microeconomics United Kingdom corporation tax Life insurance Stock Mergers and acquisitions Social Security debate (United States) Corporation Hedge fund Taxation in the United States Personal finance Supply and demand Warren Buffett Annuity Corporate finance PE ratio Stock broker Wal-Mart Arbitrage 401(k) Gross domestic product Income trust Derivative (finance) Mortgage Investment bank Model (economics) Free trade Futures contract Internet fraud Deflation (economics) Stock market Finance Option Tax Hyperinflation Gold standard Financial markets Call option Short selling Economy of Russia Michael Milken Capital gains tax Tesco Kyoto Protocol Technical analysis FairTax Equity investment Strategic management Dividend Corporate governance Sears Holdings Corporation Bank Social Security (United States) Management Government debt PricewaterhouseCoopers Japan-United States relations Publicly funded medicine Margin (finance) Eliot Spitzer Temasek Holdings Day trading Rupert Murdoch Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Security (finance) Capital accumulation Electronic commerce Citigroup Cable television Capitalism Financial analyst RKO Pictures Speculation Real estate broker Berkshire Hathaway Insider trading Xerox Trade Credit card Information Services Procurement Library Islamic banking Timeline of the Enron scandal Public transport Natural monopoly Theory of the firm __lectricit__ de France Surplus value Stock market index Gold as an investment

h r block tax preperation course in los angeles ca what would someone make doing this part time deciding on whether or not i should take the course please share your pros and cons on the idea i would not be doing this as a full time job how much would i be able to make working for hr block during tax season part time weekends and evenings what use would there certificate of achievement for the course have outside of their corp thank you hi i work in oklahoma but hopefully my experiance will help you decide first of all during the peak part of the season last third of january to about the middle of february i worked every day pm in the evening and hours on the weekend it was a bit hard on my family after peek ended the hours were cut back to a low of about hours per week they picked up again near the end of the season to about per week since i alerayd have a full time job i worked nights and weekends exclusivly just so you're aware i and everyone else had to sign a non compete clause which stated that when i separate service i could not prepare a tax return for an h r block client for two years within a mile radius of the city limits of the town i worked in thus if i didn't like working for them i can't just go work at a different tax company as mentioned before the job is commission based they gave a small draw approx to an hour against your commission however your actually compensation starts at of the paid return volume and of the optional peace of mind insurance program during last tax season i completed approximately returns and made gross keep in mind i'm in oklahoma which has the lowest cost of living of any area so i would expect the compensation to be higher elsewere besides the completed returns i i also had a number of returns i could not complete because they either walked due to the cost of preparation and or they had already done it with a tax software program and just wanted a second opinion or i refused to complete due to obvious fraud least you think i'm negative though it was a really nice fit for myself i didn't have to worry about issues that might occur if i tried doing tax returns on my own such as liability issues i also didn't have to do marketing and didn't have to invest my own money on expenses when i ran into issues i had not dealt with before ie indian exclusion there were a number of seasoned preparers to consult and advise on how to handle the issue i always tried to give my clients their money worth and because of the little things i did such as advice for the future i was able to get about to sign up for an appointment with me next tax season a year in advance these are clients i won't have to share with the other preparers in my office next year in order to get hired on they'll require you to take a basic income tax class class i've got off coupons i'd be willing to send you also can contact the local office and they should offer you a discount on the class i didn't know this and paid the full price the class has completly changed tis year previously it was on paper and pencil and required about hours outside of class for each instructional hour to complete all the exercies and reviews now however they are advertising little work outside of class time and you'll be learning to prepare the returns on the same computer system you'll use on the job around here the classes start in september we also had interns which were basically college students majoring in accounting who were doing the returns for not only cash but college credit as well they were treated exactly the same as st year preparers including being required to sign the non compete agreement and the same compensation hopefully this helps answer your questions feel free to contact me if you have any follow up

technical question about future home sale and tax implications i am considering selling my home i bought it about three months ago at a very steep discount but need to move on very long story i understand that if i live in it for a total of years and then sell i will have no tax liability on the gain i may need to sell sooner than that i need to understand the difference between selling before one year of ownership and after one year of ownership but before two years i've read a few articles on it but it's still not clear if i sell before one year of ownership do i just count the gain as ordinary income would it just go on my taxes as wages or would i report it somewhere else if i sell after one year of ownership but before two years is it taxed as a long term capital gain if so the rate would be or depending on my tax bracket any help would be greatly appreciated thank you thanks for the help here's the additional info bought for will sell for around no other properties bought or sold i am married with kids you are partly wrong about living in it for years what you have to do is live in it as your primary residence for out the years before you sell it if you do this you can exempt up to of gain if single and of gain if married if you sell it before year of ownership it is short term capital gain and would be reported on schedule d and be taxed at your regular tax bracket if you sell it after year but before the years it would be long term gain and taxed at either or depending on your tax bracket if you sell it in a rate of will replace the tax there are some exceptions that will enable you to prorate the gain if you sell it before the year holding period forced move because of job etc  Capital gains tax Tax Taxation in the United States Microeconomics Gross domestic product FairTax United Kingdom corporation tax Annuity Mutual fund Progressive tax Property tax Capitalism Income tax Surplus value Flat tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mortgage Insurance Life insurance Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Leasing Monetary policy Social Security (United States) Capital accumulation Security (finance) 401(k) Arbitrage Supply-side economics Bond Economy of Russia Inheritance tax Labor theory of value Gold standard E85 Tax cut Income trust Monopoly (game) Productive and unproductive labour Treasury security Gold as an investment Privatization Money Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Short selling Dividend imputation American individualist anarchism Corporate finance Futures contract Municipal bond Law of value Finance Hyperinflation Alcohol fuel Protectionism Warren Buffett Government debt Supply and demand Wal-Mart Price discrimination Lloyd's of London Tax avoidance/evasion Islamic banking Anarchism and capitalism Deflation (economics) Bretton Woods system MMORPG Microcredit Tax exemption Bulk vending Mergers and acquisitions Publishing Abortion debate Rupert Murdoch Wealth SCO-Linux controversies Credit card Playoff History of post-Soviet Russia Canadian and American economies compared Intellectual property Student loan Individual Savings Account Property (ownership right) Economy of India Trickle down effect Stock Form 1040 Inflation Air New Zealand Airline Yield curve Causality Hedge fund Enron Corporation United States Postal Service CPU cache

please explain the logic and legality of employer deducting tips from my paycheck lets say i do a haircut that cost the customer uses a credit card to pay they add as a tip it is rung thru the is now technically in the cash drawer i take out from the drawer as my tip when i get paid the paystub shows deducted from my pay how is this legal regis corp salons supercuts mastercuts hairmasters etc and other chain salons all do it then on top of that i must claim my tips and am taxed on them at the end of the year i don't get how this is legal please someone tell me how this could be right and if not who do i go to to file a greivance or lawsuit please don't stop giving a tip to a stylist for good service just give it to them in cash then it does not get taken away from us and we don't need to declare it cash cash cash i understand about taxing the tips yes they should be reported as income my problem here is that the company takes the tips out of my paycheck i never even get that money then at the end of the year it is reported as income and i am taxed on it even though it was taken out of my check i don't care about paying the taxes i would do it anyway the issue here is that the company takes the tips out of my check i get the cash on the day of the service but on my check it is taken back out so technically i borrowed the money that is mine to begin with and then they take it back regis corp is absolutely criminal i only go to privately owned salons i don't care if any regis owned salon is giving away haircuts i would never do anything to support their business they are total liars too they claim they don't own great clips or sports clips but look their hqs up online they are all the same address in minneapolis you can ask your boss if great clips is regis they will look you in the face and lie and tell you no hairstylists are like slave workers today it is no longer a glamorous or elite profession how do you want your hair cut ya want fries with that i would contact a lawyer it may be worth your while to file a lawsuit for recompensation as well as a hefty damages amount and to the rest of you out there tip in cash only  United Kingdom corporation tax Wal-Mart Insurance FairTax Tax Credit card Taxation in the United States Life insurance United States Postal Service Money Health insurance National Kidney Foundation Singapore Bank fraud Bond Child support Flat tax Capital accumulation Microeconomics Haircut Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economy of the United States Outsourcing Personal finance Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Annuity SCO-Linux controversies Bank Minimum wage Citigroup Mortgage Capitalism Internet fraud Surveillance EFTPOS Warren Buffett Slot machine Price discrimination Enron Corporation Apple Computer Dividend Phishing Identity theft Windows XP Income Mikhail Khodorkovsky U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Inflation Food Stamp Program Poker jargon The Amazing Race Octopus card Cash register Plame affair Hillary Rodham Clinton Make money fast Drug test 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Advance fee fraud Social Security debate (United States) Progressive tax Surplus value Ocean's Twelve 401(k) Blackjack Karl Rove Expert system Filling station Productive and unproductive labour Oil-for-Food Programme Year 2000 problem Publicly funded medicine Education in the United States $ale of the Century Economy of Russia Income tax Sears Holdings Corporation Strategic management National Insurance Tax protester Grand Theft Auto III IBM Gross domestic product Tip System/36 IPod Betting (poker) Babylonian law Corporation Exchange value Mutual fund Electronic commerce Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Lloyd's of London

i am curious as to what to do i just started working and i am told i will be paid in the form of a check for for hours and then the rest would be cash is this tax evasion he said that i would be tax free on the rest of the hours i am paid i am really suspicious of this i dont want to get in any trouble what can i do i can show you some cases with revenue that shows such similar instances that such payments may be considered under the table payments now let us say for example in this case we do not know the entire situation so can we automatically assume that it is tax evasion certainly not if the employer is to claim it as wages paid pay the social security and medicare taxes on it etc and otherwise then of course it would not be so under such cases but which employer will do this i want to find them myself many employers for example will pay the taxes on bonuses for example this is not totally unheard of is it a bonus i mean the employer may choose to pay the taxes on the wages being paid of course flsa federal fair labor standards act indicates this one you must pay the employee overtime if they work more than hours in a day period of time this does even apply to people who are considered salaried employees should check with your state of course to see if such application does apply as with all applications easily done by referring such matters to the department of labor or department of labor and industry or by other known names they may wish to refer to it as as an accountant and one who does provide payroll services i will say that i do not believe such situations are always to be considered automatic tax evasion as for example they are going to pay the taxes on the wages received again this is highly unlikely but not unheard of looking to your statement it seems to me to be slightly curious of course and i would have to agree based on what i know of course that yes this is such a case many do go unreported by the way as people do not want to lose their jobs for example and many employers get away with it take walmart for example up until some time ago they were not paying overtime for instance and now they more or less do not even let you work overtime according to some sources i have spoken with i would say you should do what you should think is right for whatever situation but if you are working overtime you should be getting paid that overtime rate as most good employers decent employers and i know both kinds good and not so good respectable ones will follow the laws or the advice of their accounting or payroll staff personally i would drop such a client if they were not and were paying people under the table but then again we are a respectable firm there are exceptions to every rule though and some cases do not require payment of overtime but i doubt they would apply to you but i will not assume they won't overall in our opinion yes it does sound suspicious but as i stated it may very well be legit i suppose you will know if you see the amount on your check as to what you should do it remains in your hands of course but it is something best resolved with the department of labor if that is so it will probably end up in the end with your losing the job and will the state or otherwise pursue charges i never assume anything with these folks wayne barney president bc business services inc  Social Security (United States) Taxation in the United States Microeconomics Minimum wage Life insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus FairTax Wal-Mart Flat tax United Kingdom corporation tax Publicly funded medicine Plame affair Child support Unemployment benefit United States Postal Service Compensation of employees Annuity Salary Salary cap Insurance Payroll Unemployment Credit card Keynesian economics Health insurance Social Security debate (United States) Overtime Economy of the United States Working time Labour economics Trade union Immigration to the United States National Insurance Article One of the United States Constitution New Deal United States labor law Labor theory of value Inflation Supply and demand Anarchism and capitalism Fair Labor Standards Act Pension Outsourcing Economic inequality H-1B visa Daylight saving time Student loan George W.

if i am tax exempt will my parents be able to file for me on their tax return i'm years old and want to be tax exempt but my parents still want to be able to claim me as their dependent is that possible you kind of have it backwards there are rules that if your parents meet them then they can claim you if you live with them for over half of the year and do not provide more than half of your own support for the year then they can claim you now for your income if they meet the rules to claim you whether they actually claim you of not then you can't claim yourself and take an exemption for yourself on your own tax return if you make less than for the year though you still won't owe any tax and if you do not expect to have any tax liability for the year and didn't have any last year then and only then can you claim exempt which means that no income tax will be withheld from your paycheck if you claim exempt on your w when you aren't then you'll have to pay taxes and possible penalties when you file a return at the end of the year plus a possible fine for claiming exempt when you aren't whether or not you claim exempt does not have any effect on whether your parents can claim you  Taxation in the United States United Kingdom corporation tax Tax Flat tax Inheritance tax Property tax Capital gains tax Social Security (United States) Tax exemption Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Insurance Tax protester Income tax Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Centrelink Student loan Tax resistance London Congestion Charge United States Postal Service Child support 401(k) British nationality law Allodial title Dividend imputation Life insurance Bankruptcy in the United States Form 1040 Article One of the United States Constitution H-1B visa Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 Education in the United States Salary cap Jizya Benny Hinn Value added tax Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Kyoto Protocol Freedom of Information Act (United States) Swedish allotment system Homestead exemption Regressive tax Corporation Income trust Tax haven First Amendment to the United States Constitution Dhimmi Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 U.S. Internal Revenue Service Tax credit Babylonian law Separation of church and state Hillary Rodham Clinton Television licence Tax avoidance/evasion Lloyd's of London Contract Progressive tax Double taxation Tax cut Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Contract with America Reparations for slavery Immigration to the United States Earned income tax credit 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Scientology Interplay Entertainment Municipal bond Constitution of Ireland Minimum wage Bankruptcy British monarchy Tai shogi Accounting methods Bulk vending Unemployment benefit Sales tax Dividend Individual Savings Account Variable universal life insurance Economy of India National Football League Players' Association Heather Wilson Economic rent Assignment (law) Slander and libel Mennonite Annuity Deposit Interest Retention Tax Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Retirement plan Administrative law of the United States Employer identification number Tax treaty Brushaber v.

any tax associates how do you like your job i am going to be starting soon and work for one of the big firms i was wondering about your thoughts on a career in tax the advantages and disadvantages as well as whether or not you have any experience working in a major accounting firm just need some opinions on this subject thanks i'm not at a big but am speaking as someone at a large regional firm advantages you will never stop learning or reach a point in your job where you feel you have bottomed out if you have the ambition you will learn more each month than you would a year in school you will find yourself rise at a faster rate than your peers who go into sales in just a few years not only will you be making a nice living starting pay isn't bad either but you will find yourself talking to the heads of large corporations as their equal in shorter time than you would think cfos etc will go to you for advice job security if you are good at what you do you will never find yourself out of work for long unless that is your choice the demand for good help is too great and that will never change to the point that you can't find a position to meet your needs cons the hours especially during tax season wk is common this hurts especially if you have young children but if you are not too much of a family person and the family friends you have are flexible this shouldn't be a reason to avoid the occupation you will probably know within a month of busy season whether you can handle the workload the specialization if you concentrate on personal tax for instance there isn't much use for that outside of the field except for maybe as a financial advisor if you specialize in smaller corps million in rev and do more than tax work you can find yourself becoming more suited for a controller position if you love tax though this isn't an issue though as there is always work for someone who is competant  FairTax Mutual fund United Kingdom corporation tax Economic inequality Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Microeconomics Education in the United States Canadian and American economies compared Inflation Free trade Life insurance Gross domestic product Supply and demand Wal-Mart Outsourcing Graduate school Taxation in the United States Management information system Education in the People's Republic of China Extreme Programming Deflation (economics) Value added tax Corporation Progressive tax Social rule CPU design 401(k) Price discrimination Insurance CPU cache Pitaten W.

i am thinking about being an independent contractor but i need to to know about the tax aspect of it i am planning to take over my best friend's job when she leaves in weeks but it is an independent contractor type of position and i want to know the tax side of that before i completely agree what are the tax rules and what is the best way to handle them as an independent contractor you'll need to pay both sides of the social security and medicare tax fica both employer and employee this means an extra tax just make sure that your hourly wage is higher as a result of this additionally you probably don't get any benefits medical or otherwise as an independent contractor but if you already have health insurance from another source this isn't a problem for you make sure to make estimated tax payments since the company will not be withholding taxes from your paycheck you'll need to send in quarterly estimates to the irs and your state if you live in a state that taxes income i'd suggest contacting a cpa to help you with figuring out how to deal with the estimates if you don't want to deal with it yourself good luck in your new job  Taxation in the United States Social Security (United States) Insurance Tax Health insurance Flat tax Unemployment Microeconomics Self-employment Social Security debate (United States) Medicare (Canada) FairTax Gross domestic product Progressive tax Minimum wage Life insurance Income tax Publicly funded medicine 401(k) Unemployment benefit National Insurance Wal-Mart Economy of the United States United Kingdom corporation tax Labour economics Canadian and American health care systems compared Compensation of employees Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Pension U.S. Internal Revenue Service Taxation in Canada Canadian federal election, 1965 Surplus value US health reform under FDR Reaganomics Productive and unproductive labour Capitalism Child support Variable universal life insurance Government debt HIPAA Barbara Boxer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Income trust Keynesian economics Medicaid National Health Service Economy of India Earned income tax credit Capital accumulation Affirmative action Social Security Administration Monopsony Economy of Russia Heather Wilson Trade union H-1B visa Hillary Rodham Clinton Economic inequality Politics of Canada New Deal Retirement plan Tariff Actuary Welfare trap Kyoto Protocol Inflation United States labor law Celtic Tiger Tax protester Social security ITV Mortgage Health savings account Great Depression Warren Buffett Tax resistance Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Medicare (Australia) Tax credit Free trade U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Air traffic controller Efficiency wages George W.

does the irs ever make mistakes my girlfriend just received a letter saying she owes xx xxx from we filed a truthful tax form in and every yr previous and cant imagine why this is i just need some peace of mind someone to tell me that irs has been known to make mistakes thanks as a former irs drone a period of my life i refer to lovingly as that time i leased my soul i can tell you that mistakes can and do occur however the irs will make you prove it's a mistake and do not assume that you didn't do anything wrong so you can ignore it that's the fastest way to make absolutely certain you end up in a lot of trouble like they could start placing tax liens on any property she owns or even property you own jointly plus they could start garnishing her wages she needs to contact them and do it now it's entirely possible that someone has stolen her identity the latest thing in stolen identities is to steal a social security regardless of credit rating sell it to an illegal alien who then gets a job and doesn't pay taxes it may be years later but the irs will eventually catch it and guess why come after yep that's right this is also why you need to check to see if you have identity theft coverage on your homeowners tenant policy and or a stand alone policy sometimes credit card companies will offer it but those are almost always limited to how these things impact your credit and there are even worse things than having your credit screwed up like having the irs breathing down your neck seriously advise you girlfriend to get in touch with the irs as soon as possible and if she doesn't have a broad identity theft policy she needs to get one you can sometimes add it onto an existing homeowners tenant condo policy for or so a year good luck  Insurance Taxation in the United States FairTax Password Microeconomics Bank fraud Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Internet fraud Mortgage Capital accumulation Life insurance Plame affair Identity theft Property (ownership right) Tom DeLay 401(k) Tax Allodial title Capitalism Nintendo Auto insurance Variable universal life insurance Social Security (United States) Property tax United Kingdom corporation tax H-1B visa Wal-Mart Credit repair Intellectual property Theory of conduct Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Minimum wage EastEnders British national identity card Kent Hovind Annuity Arthur Laffer 2000 Australian Grand Prix Home insurance United States Postal Service Sin City Leasehold estate Corporation Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Income tax Contract George W.

single menber llc company working for free my mother has a llc single member company im helping her with her business everyday i don't get any payment for that so its advisable that my mother include me like her employee could her business have any problem if irs find out that she has an employee and she doesn't declare me like that because i'm working for free what will be the advantage if she declare me how employee could she deduce more taxes if declares me employee thank you in advance great question first i know of no reason for the irs to be upset that you are working for your mother for free there could be an issue with her employing someone for less than the minimum wage but i don't think that applies to llcs who employ their children however you both may be unwittingly causing the family to overpay in taxes why first of all if you are under and you are working for an unincorporated family business you are exempt from paying social security medicare tax if you are under you don't have to pay futa tax second regardless how old you are the first so many thousands of income is federally tax free to you if you are claimed by your parents that amount in is if you are claiming yourself that amount rises to at least not only is that money federal tax free to you but your mother could be writing it off if you have children of your own you may even qualify for credits which means you get money from the irs even if you had nothing withheld so right there by not paying you you are losing tax savings remember whatever she pays you in income and fica taxes she gets to write off from her profits that means she saves federal taxes and fica taxes if she is in the tax bracket when you consider fica taxes she saves around for every she pays you had she given you in she would have saved in taxes she saves more if she is in a higher tax bracket the savings may be greater when you factor in state taxes but each state is different so i can't comment further the mere fact that you are probably in a lower tax bracket means even if you don't consider your standard deductions or fica situation the family is losing out as if all that weren't enough you could be putting money away for retirement if you had income you could shelter up to of into a traditional ira in so if you claim yourself and are not married or have dependents the first your mother pays you is federal tax free you pocket and you put into your traditional ira no federal taxes at all of course you could also put money into a roth ira which i would recommend if you don't need the write off but it won't lower your taxable income please consider all the ramifications first but in general paying children to work in the family business is not only a good learning experience for everyone parent learns how to pay employees using a w child gets a paycheck and learns how to do his her tax return and learns about saving for retirement it can also save the family lots of money in taxes  Tax Microeconomics FairTax Life insurance Social Security debate (United States) Health insurance Insurance Income tax United Kingdom corporation tax Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Minimum wage Reaganomics Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Publicly funded medicine Variable universal life insurance Inflation Roth IRA Capitalism Supply-side economics Annuity Limited liability company Self-employment National Insurance Keynesian economics Tax bracket Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Capital accumulation Gross domestic product Surplus value Corporation Health savings account Mutual fund U.S. Internal Revenue Service Tax protester Divorce Tax avoidance/evasion Credit card Dividend Income trust Wal-Mart Deflation (economics) Unemployment Article One of the United States Constitution Arthur Laffer Education in the United States George W.

how to lower property tax i bought a house not long ago but with recent circumstances my budget is really tight and it's time to pay property taxes does anyone know how i can lower them the tax is based upon two factors revenue the town needs to generate and the portion your house needs to pay the best option would be to go after factor and try to decrease the town's spending become active in your local town government by using your power to vote and using your voice you may be able to oppose issues that provide more cost than benefit to the community an example would be fighting against a new fire department building that looks beautiful over renovating the current building at a lower cost check in with your local assessor's office to see if there are any programs available that would reduce your tax for instance in ma we have a that allows for a reduction in property tax if you own a farm and another break that allows senior citizens to abate up to maybe of their tax if they provide some service the town such as hours a week shelving books at the library other than similar programs your only option is to reduce your tax assessement most assessor offices take into account things such as gross living area sheds pools land etc while it may seem silly find out your town's formula and see if there is anything driving up the cost that you don't want or need maybe you have an old garage that is falling down that is significantly increasing your tax bill tearing it down might provide an answer other than those weak suggestions you usually don't have a choice in your property tax bill as it should be based on a formula that allows for equal treatment to every property owner  Property tax FairTax Gross domestic product Publicly funded medicine Taxation in the United States Microeconomics Life insurance Flat tax United Kingdom corporation tax Insurance Tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Privatization Economy of Russia Inflation Surplus value Progressive tax Medicare (Canada) Capitalism Health insurance British House of Commons Unemployment benefit Social Security (United States) Paul Martin California Proposition 13 (1978) Canadian House of Commons Economy of India Annuity Inheritance tax Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Education in the United States Political subdivisions of New York State New Deal History of the United States (1918-1945) Food Stamp Program Politics of Canada Deflation (economics) Politics of the United States Value added tax Student loan Wal-Mart Town meeting Prostate cancer Government of France Government debt 39th Canadian federal election Arguments for and against drug prohibition Contract with America Common Agricultural Policy United States Senate Outsourcing Risk management Local government in the United Kingdom Capital accumulation Tax cut Mutual fund Parliament of the United Kingdom Conscription Tariff Salary cap Externality Separation of church and state U.S. public debt Nuclear power Elections in the United Kingdom Biodiesel Economy of the United States Canadian and American health care systems compared Manitoba Hydro School choice Euro Public housing Divorce Supply-side economics Monopsony Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Canadian and American economies compared Politics of Russia Congress of the United States Gold standard Easement Wind power Democratic Party (United States) Nuclear power phase-out Space Shuttle program Article One of the United States Constitution Personal finance Donald Trump Bruce Johnson Expert system MMORPG United States Department of the Treasury

i'm looking to make a website for internet sales using paypal for a ft job see below for more details since you don't have federal taxes taken out working self employed i'm assuming that you could pay the taxes that you owe yearly quarterly however since you don't receive checks from an employer and still must file taxes what do you do about the w form there is no w form you keep track of your income and expenses including deductible expenses and report the difference profit on your federal and state tax forms it's on you to be honest and keep all records as proof in case you are audited if you owe more than in federal taxes when you file in april you'll pay a penalty there's a st year exception to this rule in order to avoid owing more than you have to make estimated payments on a quarterly basis using es something similar exists for your state as well but the rules and forms vary by state keep in mind that in addition to federal and state taxes you also have to pay double for social security and medicare half of it is called self employment tax because normally an employer pays that half that's it gets tricky because of other multipliers and the self employment half is actually deductible from federal this all probably sounds like gibberish you could go through a tax program taxcut quicken whatever and irs forms and publications to learn all this yourself or you could see someone who does this for a living if you're not a permanent resident citizen your situation might be different  Taxation in the United States United Kingdom corporation tax Flat tax Tax Social Security (United States) FairTax 401(k) Child support Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Health insurance Publicly funded medicine Annuity H-1B visa Medicare (Canada) Self-employment Progressive tax Unemployment benefit Income tax Insurance Gross domestic product Life insurance National Insurance Immigration to the United States Student loan Credit card Tax resistance Payroll Social Security debate (United States) Food Stamp Program Tax protester Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 George W.

income tax exemption problem when i originally interviewed for my current job i didn't mark myself as exempt on my w form i later found out i was indeed tax exempt and refiled through my job however upon recieving my paycheck today i find that my check has indeed been gutted by federal income taxes i complain to payroll only for them to tell me we will fix it for next week but there is nothing we can do about this week's check with that said is there really nothing payroll can do is the idea that they already sent the money to the government and so they truly cant adjust the income tax out of my check or do i just have a lazy bum for a payroll chief if indeed i can't work it out with my job how do i get the lost income tax money back in the fastest possible way it was which is plenty for a college student i have done payroll for over years and this is what i can tell you depending on the amount of tax withheld a company deposits the taxes weekly bimonthly or monthly with a federal depository such as the bank of america the irs has no idea of the breakdown of the money until the w s are filed by the company at the end of the year they may also report it to the state more frequently they can therefore technically adjust their payroll and give the money back they just deposit less the next period it just may be that their payroll can't handle that type of transaction since it must be done manually i do the work for a very small company and would have no problem if they can't give it back then your only recourse is to file for a refund next year there is no way to get it from the irs early since they have no record of you personally paying the money until they receive the w s  Taxation in the United States Social Security (United States) FairTax Tax Flat tax Inflation U.S. Internal Revenue Service Payroll Microeconomics Social Security debate (United States) United Kingdom corporation tax Progressive tax Child support United States Postal Service Credit card Wal-Mart 401(k) Annuity Bank fraud Automated Clearing House Mutual fund Minimum wage Money supply Bond Income tax Unemployment benefit Variable universal life insurance Earned income tax credit Health savings account National Insurance Tom DeLay Mortgage Student loan Tax exemption Tax protester Salary Inheritance tax Corporation Tax resistance Personal finance New Deal Money Capital gains tax Retirement plan Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Bank Federal Reserve Tax haven Outsourcing Regressive tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economy of Russia Treasury security Octopus card Gross domestic product Capital accumulation Poker jargon Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Advance fee fraud Life insurance Tax avoidance/evasion George W.

why would the person who caught barry bonds th homerun ball owe taxes even if he doesn't sell the ball http sports yahoo com mlb news ylt arslkjgqctqqvrffv irojg nycb slug ap bonds ball prov ap type lgns even if he does not sell the ball murphy would still owe the taxes based on a reasonable estimate of its value according to john barrie a tax lawyer with bryan cave llp in new york capital gains taxes also could be levied in the future as the ball gains value he said i don't understand why he would have to owe taxes on the reasonable estimate of the value of the ball if he never sells it i understand paying taxes after he sells it that's mr barrie's opinion i do not agree with it and the irs has refused to comment publicly on the issue several folks have already commented on the issue do a search and you'll find a number of comments that disagree with most of what mr barrie says imho mr barrie is pushing for some free publicity and he's certainly getting that determining the ball's value is fraught with multiple minefields when it left the pitcher's hand it was worth about or so the price of a mlb ball can anyone accurately predict a value based upon it being hit by a possbily juiced up ballpayer will further home runs by mr bonds affect the value how about if his records are stripped the best predictor of its value will be what it sells for should mr murphy decide to sell it at that point the irs will be unquestionably entitled to its due given the fact that mr bonds' future is not assured mr murphy's best bet would be to unload it as quickly as possible and pay any tax based upon the sales price  Barry Bonds FairTax Taxation in the United States Baseball Home run Microeconomics Tax Insurance Major League Baseball Life insurance Boston Red Sox Annuity Government debt Baseball Stars Major League Baseball television contracts Babe Ruth Bond U.S. public debt Inflation San Francisco Giants Mortgage Blackjack Mutual fund Supply and demand Monetary policy Baseball statistics Baseball (object) World Series Andr__s Galarraga Manny Ram__rez United Kingdom corporation tax Hyperinflation Property tax Money Sammy Sosa Capital gains tax Troy Glaus Plame affair Estoppel Income trust Corporation Capitalism Income tax Rugby union positions Cricket Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Rick Santorum Debt Surplus value Prediction market Contract Poker jargon Tris Speaker Supply-side economics Los Angeles Dodgers Gross domestic product 39th Canadian federal election Causality UK Singles Chart Softball Hank Aaron Flat tax Salary cap History of baseball in the United States Gold standard Stolen base Major League Baseball All-Star Game Ra (board game) Computer chess Capital accumulation Kent Hovind Mark McGwire U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Willie Mays November 3 in baseball Gambling Charles O.

married filing separately but denied deduction for my wife why my wife is a nonresident alien with no us income and did not file a return i filed as married filing separately claiming her as an exemption and taking the standard deduction now i got back a letter from the irs that says my standard deduction was rejected because when your filing status is married filing separately and your spouse itemizes deductions you must also itemize information on your tax return indicates that your spouse itemized deductions therefore we used zero as your deduction amount if my wife didn't file a return how could she have itemized deductions should we be worried about identify theft of her ssn how does the irs know from information on your return that my wife itemized that doesn't make any sense the irs representative on the phone wasn't helpful at all and wouldn't clarify what this letter means what should i do i should have mentioned that my wife has foreign income which we didn't want taxed that is why we filed separately from the irs if you file a separate return you can claim the exemption for your spouse only if your spouse had no gross income is not filing a return and was not the dependent of another taxpayer this is true even if the other taxpayer does not actually claim your spouse as a dependent this is also true if your spouse is a nonresident alien i am a u s citizen married to a nonresident alien who has no income from u s sources can i claim an exemption for my spouse on my u s tax return yes if you file a joint return you can claim an exemption for your nonresident alien spouse if you do not file a joint return you can claim an exemption for your nonresident alien spouse only if your spouse has has no income from sources within the united states and is not the dependent of another u s taxpayer responding to the comment from bostonianinmo my wife does have a valid ssn from the time she was a student in the us now i'm worried that since she hasn't used the number in many years someone else may have adopted it as their own i think you have more accurate information than the previous answers as you note you are allowed an exemption for your nonresident alien spouse on a mfs return even the irs is not questioning that fact the letter says that your return has information that your spouse itemizes that confuses me but may be the best approximation available in the computer generated letters if your nonresident alien spouse did file a return she would not be allowed the standard deduction i am guessing that the irs is assuming she has or will file a tax return taking itemized deductions and forcing your return to take itemized deductions i would write back explaining what you already know i would include a statement maybe notarized and signed by your spouse that your spouse had no us source income and did not file a return if you can provide a copy of the ss card or other document with her ss number that might help the irs sort things out if the ssn has become attached to another return your other course of action is just to go ahead and itemize taking your state taxes etc your standard deduction was only anyway it may make it easier for you if only a few dollars are involved  Flat tax United Kingdom corporation tax Tax protester Plame affair FairTax Social Security (United States) United States Postal Service

with all of the services that are essential to our nation is there an effective tax structure that can work the current graduated income tax works quite nicely it's based upon the taxpayers ability to pay and therefore is the fairest possible tax a flat rate tax would disproportionally hit the poor and middle class only the wealthy would benefit a flat tax would have to be levied at to equal the revenue from the current graduated tax system only the wealthiest taxpayers pay anything anywhere near that for a net rate most taxpayers pay between and net of gross income in federal income tax and would therefore pay much higher taxes with a flat rate tax  Tax Taxation in the United States FairTax Property tax Income tax Microeconomics Tax bracket Gross domestic product United Kingdom corporation tax Trickle down effect Regressive tax Capitalism Publicly funded medicine Inheritance tax Wealth condensation Dividend imputation Social Security debate (United States) Taxation in Canada Life insurance Value added tax Value product California Proposition 13 (1978) United States Postal Service Surplus value Tax credit Social Security (United States) Tax deduction Economic inequality Affirmative action Privatization Capital gains tax Measures of national income and output Tax protester Productive and unproductive labour Education in the United States Canadian and American economies compared Reaganomics Inflation Income trust Poll tax Unemployment benefit Capital accumulation Individual Savings Account U.S. Internal Revenue Service Tax haven Separation of church and state Mutual fund Barbara Boxer Minimum wage Expert system 401(k) Balanced Budget Amendment Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Labour economics Tax avoidance/evasion Operating surplus Salary cap Medicare (Australia) Tax Freedom Day Economy of Norway Liberal Democrats (UK) Value added Wal-Mart Bretton Woods system Economic growth Supply-side economics Guaranteed minimum income Government debt Welfare trap Economy of India Connecticut Anarchism and capitalism Municipal bond Economic history of the United States Credit card Pigovian tax Airline Economy of Pakistan Price discrimination Unemployment Income statement Ponzi scheme Health savings account Variable universal life insurance Annuity Income Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Equalization payments Taxation in the United Kingdom Health insurance History of the United States (1789-1849)

tax question relating to a gift of real estate i asked similar question before but need more opinions i work for a company that lays out and designs residential subdivision projects my boss is the owner of the company and we've been lifelong friends he has worked out a deal with a developer wherein instead of charging our normal fees for designing his project the developer is going to give my boss lots in the development each of these lots will be valued at approximately dollars my boss has said he is going to outright give me one of the three lots i'm trying to figure out the best way to do this so that it minimizes the tax hit on both of us my boss and i have a side company we set up this year an llc with he and i as the only partners its purpose is to buy and develop real estate so my questions are if my boss gives me a lot is it considered a bonus and thus taxable as income or is it a gift what are the tax implications of the latter if that's what it is would there be any advantage to see more below question continued would there be any advantage in my boss deeding my lot over to our llc or would the tax rate be even higher question another alternative my boss is considering is for the developer to deed him lots and then deed the other lot to me this way my boss is not involved in the transaction of me receiving my lot is there any tax advantage to doing it that way we're just looking for legal strategies to effect this transfer that would cause the least amount of tax hit to both of us any advice or other options would be appreciated wayne z what if my boss gifted the lot to my wife instead of to me please understand neither me nor my boss is trying to get away with anything we're simply looking for the best legal strategy to minimize our tax burden we're not interested in violating any laws i don't think there's any way out of this normally gifts are not taxable to the person who receives it but in this case the lots would take the place of the fee so your boss has income equal to the value of the lots at the time he receives them he possibly could gift you a lot and there would be no tax affect to you but the irs would probably challenge it and say that it was a bonus you might win and you might lose if it is a gift to you which if he's not in the habit of giving you a bonus after a successful job it could wind up as a gift considering you've been lifelong friends then there is no tax to you for receiving the gift but there would be taxes when you sold the lot if you held the lot for more than year it would be taxed to you as long term capital gain which is taxed at a maximum rate of for those in the or brackets your boss would also have capital gains taxes as well if he sold his lots for more than they were worth when he receives them i don't think you both can avoid taxes but i have given you my best idea to minimize them  Taxation in the United States Microeconomics Tax Life insurance Corporation United Kingdom corporation tax Inheritance tax FairTax Progressive tax Mortgage Property tax Leasing Annuity 401(k) Insurance Surplus value Variable universal life insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Capital accumulation Easement Tax avoidance/evasion Capital gains tax Supply and demand Dividend Income tax Tax haven Rule in Shelley's Case Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Limited liability company Gross domestic product Labor theory of value Express trust Trust (Law) USA Monopoly (game) Tax protester Islamic banking Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Wheel of Fortune Supply-side economics Inflation Municipal bond Warren Buffett Capitalism Credit card Democracy Stamp duty Microcredit GNU General Public License Donald Trump Bretton Woods system Wealth Bond Minimum wage Guild Wars Property (ownership right) Prices of production Allodial title Tax bracket Poker jargon Hedge fund Real property Reaganomics Salary cap Derivative (finance) Expert system Health insurance Alex Ferguson Contract Monetary policy Social Security (United States) Ra (board game) Estoppel MMORPG Intellectual property Economic rent Copyright Trust (Law) non-USA Urban sprawl Theory of conduct Free trade Money Dividend imputation Concurrent estate Security (finance) Labor-power Value added tax Advance fee fraud Education in the United States Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution LiveJournal Economic inequality

how much taxes need to be paid on this specific lawsuit settlement hello all i am getting in backpay wages and for compensatory damages i live in the state of maryland and i just want to know how many taxes will the state take out what tax bracket does the fall in i want to know exactly what i will be left with after taxes i already know that they cannot touch the because it is for compensatory damages thank you the wages is fully taxable there's no way out of that the k compensatory damages are only tax free if they were due to physical injury or illness i do believe that there is now a court case that does add mental stress and anguish to the physical injury or illness criteria but don't have a ready reference on that if the k in comp damages was not due to physical injury or illness with a possible inclusion of mental anguish and stress then it will be fully taxable as well the total tax will depend upon your tax bracket the taxable portions of the award are added to your other income for the year that the award is paid if you're already in the tax bracket it will be taxed at that level at least some of it may well kick you up to the bracket so it could be higher than your current bracket in the end state taxes would depend upon your state tax bracket and would be in addition to the federal tax bite in most cases these settlements are not subject to withholding so you will have to set aside enough of the settlement to pay the taxes due better yet you should make a payment using form es to cover the expected liability to avoid any possibility of penalties for undermayment of tax as well as to get it out of your hands so you don't spend it on something else and leave yourself hanging that way  Tax United Kingdom corporation tax FairTax Income tax Flat tax 401(k) Progressive tax Social Security (United States) Microeconomics Insurance Inheritance tax Life insurance Tax protester Negligence Corporation Workers' compensation Annuity Value added tax Supply-side economics Tax resistance Health insurance Social Security debate (United States) Minimum wage Football (soccer) Mutual fund Municipal bond Inflation Capital gains tax Medical malpractice Child support Tax avoidance/evasion Tort Divorce Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Hypoglycemia Gross domestic product Education in the United States Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Tax bracket Affirmative action Abortion Income trust Economy of India Tort reform Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Lawsuit Article One of the United States Constitution Property tax Labor-power Capitalism Leasing Arthur Laffer Unemployment Contract Puerto Rico Variable universal life insurance Tax haven Government of Maryland Bracket Surplus value Medicare (Canada) Limited liability company Measures of national income and output Keynesian economics Dividend Nuclear power Democratic Party (United States) Case citation Government debt Payroll Trade union Civil Rights Act of 1991 Post-traumatic stress disorder Capital accumulation Reaganomics Baseball Supply and demand Unemployment benefit Double taxation Tax treaty Health savings account Katelyn Faber Non-economic damages caps Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs C programming language Credit card Decompression sickness Regressive tax U.S. public debt Reiki 613 mitzvot Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act

is paying taxes constitutional i have often thought about the number of times we pay tax on a good in the usa example a seed producer charges tax upon selling the seeds to a farmer the farmer grows wheat and again pays tax on selling is wheat to a bread maker the bread maker sells loafs of bread to a store and pays a tax the store sells the bread to the consumer and we pay tax this is just an example and some think i have often thought about we paid to times tax on the same item nope you don't understand our tax laws we don't have a gst in the us we have a sales tax the farmer doesn't pay taxes on his seeds neither does the baker or the store and you don't pay sales taxes on the bread either because it's a staple unlike canada and europe the us doesn't have a gst which puts a tax throughout the whole production process in the us some states impose a sales tax the tax is on non essential goods and serives and is only imposed upon the end consumer  Goods and Services Tax (Canada) Bread Value added tax Microeconomics Supply and demand Tariff Organic food Taxation in the United States Alcoholic beverage Money FairTax Brian Mulroney Public good Agricultural policy Wheat Sales tax Wal-Mart Agriculture Cereal Organic certification Food Surplus value Protectionism Supermarket Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Credit card Subsidy Prohibition Mortgage Commodity Illegal drug trade Bagel Bulk vending Sugar Barley Cigarette Economy of the United States Taxation in Canada Monsanto Harmonized Sales Tax Keynesian economics Free trade Internet fraud United Kingdom corporation tax Legal issues of cannabis Capital accumulation Hemp Genetically modified food Famine Excise Gross domestic product Electronic commerce Productive and unproductive labour Intellectual property Dairy Poll tax Advertising Progressive tax Gold as an investment Biodiesel Stamp Act Economic history of Canada Inventory Economy of Poland Capitalism Citigroup Corporation Income statement Filling station Inflation Law of value Supply-side economics Green Revolution White bread Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Corporate farming Copyleft Mutual fund Retailer Acorn Life insurance Value product Serfdom Trademark Great Depression Flat tax Measures of national income and output Costco Contract Income tax Organic farming Health insurance History of the United States (1918-1945) Flax Goods and Services Tax (Australia) Marginalism Kosher foods

how does the charitable giving tax deduction work this issue sometimes comes up about giving at church and deducting it from personal taxes but i don't understand the whole concept basically the question is this if a person gives their church a qualified non profit organization a donation or offering and the person reports the gift on their income taxes does the irs simply just not tax the amount that was given in other words does the gift increase the amount of non taxable income then secondly what kind of supporting documentation would the irs require to substantiate the claim churches don't normally give receipts for offerings taken during service please state your qualifications if you have an informed answer thanks does the gift increase the amount of non taxable income no it increases itemized tax deductions if the taxpayer itemizes what kind of supporting documentation if the donation is under the cancelled check would count as a receipt if it is over you would need written acknowledgement from the church beginning if you donate cash and do not receive a receipt no deduction can be claimed charitable deductions are one of the itemized deductions on schedule a along with home mortgage interest state taxes and medical expenses taxpayers can deduct either the standard deduction or their itemized deductions whichever is higher generally speaking as mortgage interest is usually the biggest deduction unless you own a house and are paying a mortgage your itemized deductions won't be high enough to get a tax benefit some states minnesota for one allow a partial deduction for charitable contributions even if you do not itemize  FairTax United Kingdom corporation tax Life insurance Tax Income tax Insurance Social Security (United States) Microeconomics Charitable trust Mortgage Annuity Health insurance Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Wal-Mart Progressive tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Gross domestic product Mutual fund Inheritance tax Publicly funded medicine Social Security debate (United States) Health savings account Self-employment Credit card Income statement Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Natural deduction Tax bracket National Kidney Foundation Singapore Capital gains tax Variable universal life insurance Conservation easement Scientology United States Postal Service Expert system Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Child support Trust (Law) USA Income trust Personal finance Municipal bond Church of Scientology Corporation Food Stamp Program Productive and unproductive labour Inflation National Insurance Employee stock option Form 1040 Tom DeLay Intellectual property Property tax Payroll Dividend imputation Ponzi scheme Primerica Financial Services SAT Reaganomics Barbara Boxer Dividend Supply and demand Sport utility vehicle Hybrid vehicle Article One of the United States Constitution Student loan Mail fraud Model (economics) Unemployment benefit Bond Tax resistance $ale of the Century Double taxation Concurrent estate Supply-side economics Scientology beliefs and practices Labor theory of value Limited liability company Security (finance) Tertiary education fees in Australia Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Organ donation Apprenticeship Accounting methods Health care in the United States Registered Retirement Savings Plan Education in the United States U.S. Internal Revenue Service Cash register Offshoring

donating computers for tax write offs i have a couple of computers sitting in storage that i don't use and i don't honestly know if they work one of them doesn't for sure the other one i just don't remember i want to get rid of these computers and i know there are places where i can donate these computers to be put back together and refurbished for schools and other charitable organizations i was curious how this applies to the concept of a tax writeoff and what benefit that has for me i don't know anything about this but it sounds like it might save me some money if not oh well but i would like to know a little bit more about it since i'm sure this won't be the last time i end up donating something i don't use to a charity or other organization thanks in advance it wouldn't be a tax write off but would be a non cash charitable contribution and would be deducted on schedule a itemized deductions under charity non cash the only thing is if one doesn't work it isn't worth much if anything at all and on donating something other than cash you get a donation for the market value of the item what it is worth so by donating a broken computer you would be donating something worth nothing and that is what you would get for a non cash deduction oh to get any benefit also from the non cash deduction you have to itemize as well with your total itemized deductions being more than your standard deduction ps kathy a is partly incorrect you can't donate to a person it has to be an organization donations to a person are not tax deductible also if you donate the computers this year you would report the donation on your schedule a which you will fill out in  Flat tax Microeconomics United Kingdom corporation tax Tax Charitable trust Taxation in the United States Theory of conduct Life insurance Non-profit organization Annuity Tax deduction FairTax Warren Buffett Social Security (United States) Wal-Mart National Insurance Health insurance School choice Tax bracket United Way Jeopardy!

what happens if you filed as single but should have filed as married i got married outside of the us to a foreign national i lived and worked in the us up until august of last year then left the us to move to my husband's country my parents filed my tax claim in my absence but they filed me as single instead of married i've already received my return and wasn't audited but i'm wondering if there is any way the irs could find out that i filed mistakenly and if i could be penalized for it i e when i send them a copy of my marriage certificate in order to have my last name updated in their records thanks in advance you need to file an amended return since you were married you cannot file as single unless your non resident alien husband agrees to have his income taxed by the us as well you must file as married filing separately get a copy of form x and file the amended return you will be facing penalties and interest on any tax due and these will continue to mount until you file the amended return and pay the tax due the mere fact that you have not been audited yet means nothing the irs has until april to audit your return  United Kingdom corporation tax Tax protester Taxation in the United States H-1B visa Flat tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus FairTax Public domain Constitution of Ireland U.S. Internal Revenue Service Scientology Lawrence v.

help with tax audit accountants i was recently audited i work for a railroad and am required to have a phone so i claimed it as an employee business expense it was disallowed in the audit i was allowed to deduct my cell phone but not the home line in addition i keep a vehicle at my away from home terminal to use when i eat it is not required but the company does not provide a way to get meals at the away fromhome terminal the vehicle mileage log i keep was also disallowed other employees have been audited and were allowed the exact same deductions there seems to be no consistency in the field auditors are these deductions valid in my case or is the auditor correct at first blush i'd say that the auditor was correct a home phone line is virtually never deductible as you're virtually certain to have one for personal use anyway any long distance charges on it related to work would be deductible however meal runs are personal use so that usage would not be allowable if you made runs for your employer say for parts or to transport yourself or other employees to other job sites that would be deductible the use has to be required by your employer and for his benefit for the expense to be deductible since you weren't present at the other audits you have no way of knowing what was allowed on them or how the other folks presented the expenses and tied them to an employer requirement  Insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Taxation in the United States United Kingdom corporation tax Child support Halliburton Self-employment Taxicab Tax Accountancy 401(k) Hybrid vehicle Annuity Health insurance Financial audit Scientology Life insurance Public transport Information technology audit Social Security (United States) Corporate governance PricewaterhouseCoopers Sport utility vehicle Auto insurance Food Stamp Program HIPAA FairTax Board of directors 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Compensation of employees Sarbanes-Oxley Act Tax deduction Microeconomics Enterprise content management Credit card Scientology beliefs and practices Transport in Hong Kong Expert system Logic Payroll Enron Corporation Financial statements Outsourcing Health savings account IP Multimedia Subsystem Domestic partnerships in California Indian Railways American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Rail transport United States Postal Service Database management system London Underground Interstate Highway Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Employee stock option Propositional calculus Passenger car Docklands Light Railway Private branch exchange Offshoring Natural deduction Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 U.S. generally accepted accounting principles Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority North American Numbering Plan National Insurance XML Telephone Password George W.

is taking fewer deductions to have a large tax refund smart my husband insists on rigging his w so that we pay out a lot in taxes and get a to tax refund every year while this has been nice and something to look forward to every janurary i want to start saving and investing i think he should have more tax home pay so we can start a retirement account and long term savings right now we have nothing he doesn't want to and says absolutely not i know this is because it is fun to have a lump sum of money to do things with but i think we could be using or money more wisely thoughts more take home pay no tax home pay sorry as a volunteer tax preparer i have this argument all the time with people who make interest free loans to the government so they can have the satisfaction of getting a check in the mail i never saw anyone deliberately get a refund however that's really beyond the pale the pattern of irresponsible money management and spending you are describing is a sure road to financial ruin and or marital problems if he is totally unable to put aside a dime and won't listen to your concerns then you need marital counseling as well as financial planning assuming you aren't independently wealthy your options are to get finances straightened out now divorce and work for yourself die young or live in poverty when you both can't work the easiest solution from a financial point of view is to put that a year in a k you won't miss it from the weekly paycheck it will reduce your overall tax bill it will grow tax deferred and his employer will probably match a portion of it with free money  Social Security (United States) Annuity Life insurance Gross domestic product FairTax Microeconomics Taxation in the United States Flat tax 401(k) Insurance Capitalism Tax Mutual fund Credit card Publicly funded medicine Capital accumulation Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Student loan Keynesian economics Divorce United Kingdom corporation tax Debt Inflation Supply-side economics Primerica Financial Services Government debt Progressive tax Public policy Voluntary Student Unionism Reaganomics Mortgage Arthur Laffer Personal finance Economy of India Warren Buffett Money Free trade Unemployment benefit Marshall Plan Bretton Woods system Child support Surplus value Hillary Rodham Clinton George W.

is taking the tax course a good idea for a nineteen year old entrepreneur i have a life health license too this depends on your personal goals i did something similar i took the tax course from the nation's premier tax preparation firm and worked a season in their offices doing tax returns this is probably the major advantage the ability to do this very profitable work seasonally or be able to work independently as a tax consultant i went further and got 'e file authorized' with the irs so that i could do electronic filing on my own as well as offer the bank loan products rapid refunds etc and feel that i was personally helping my clients rather than being an agent of someone else's glory anyway when i later went to work as a financial adviser and acquired the l h licenses it was not hard to see that almost all of our financial transactions and interactions have tax implications with your l h licenses if you plan to continue in financial services the pressure is on to continue with the investment products or obviously you won't be able to sell the variable contracts or investment related products variable life included taking the series and or and are obviously your next steps if you want to continue or advance in the financial services industry but then you're and entrepreneur this means to me that you are looking for ways to make money from you individual efforts and tend to prefer to work in a business of your own rather than on someone's payroll where you go from here only you can decide but i think you are already on the track to putting together a package of portable marketable skills that will help you in any business these skills will help you to maintain an air of independence and give you the flexibility to keep yourself occupied at a good income level my advice go ahead and take the tax course it's inexpensive and you'll have it under your belt if your later goals point you further along this path you're in charge  Insurance Life insurance FairTax Bank Microeconomics Investment bank United Kingdom corporation tax Primerica Financial Services Tax Annuity 401(k) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Monetary policy Progressive tax Economy of Russia Mutual fund Taxation in the United States Gross domestic product Bretton Woods system Islamic banking Security (finance) Privatization Microcredit Mergers and acquisitions Credit card Citigroup Capitalism Inflation Flat tax Strategic management Free trade Economy of the United States Wal-Mart Publicly funded medicine Corporation United States Postal Service Institutional fund management Enterprise content management Corporate finance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Stock Theory of the firm Public good Tesco Warren Buffett Economic inequality Airline Capital accumulation Wells Fargo Hedge fund Financial services Real estate broker Labor-power Bank fraud Supply and demand Surplus value Finance Productive and unproductive labour Economy of India Price discrimination Economic relations of Japan Deflation (economics) Salary cap Free market Enron Corporation Gold standard Personal finance Social Security (United States) Toronto-Dominion Bank Corporate governance Customer relationship management Economy of Pakistan Supply-side economics Venture capital Economic history of Japan Mortgage Business Goldman Sachs BAE Systems Coalition Provisional Authority Open source culture Value added tax Prices of production Expert system Kyoto Protocol Copyleft MUMPS Social Security debate (United States) Health insurance Derivative (finance) Management information system

earned income tax credit my daughter is has a year old son she still lives at home and makes under thousand a year as a housekeeper for the last i have been claiming her and her son for earned income credit last year was the first year she has ever filed taxes and this will be her second year filing taxes she is upset that again i am going to claim her and her son on my taxes and get earned income credit for both of them she feels that she should be able to do it or both of us be able to do it also i know we both can not claim her son on both our taxes my question is who has more right to claim him her or me yes i pay for most of everything through out the year i told her i would give her part of the money from eitc but she doesnt want that she wants it all my big problem is i really do not want my year old have that much money at one time help her answer is on the form if you provide more than half of her support she is your dependant anyone falls under this category whther they are minors adults or whatever if she claims eitc with in wages she will get nothing it's called 'earned income' for a reason the more you make the more credit you get and more money she will get ten times as much if she lets you claim her and her son than if she claimed her son as 'head of household' which legally she cannot it's pretty simple math and simple logic eitc is given to people to encourage them to get better jobs eventually earning enough to not qualify anymore at she probably won't qualify to get any money at all if she is a student she is exempt from paying taxes up to a certain amount but she still must file a year old who earns over a year must file a tax return even though he wouldn't owe any taxes bottom line is she will shoot herself in the foot by demanding that you not claim her and her child on your tax return not only that she has no legal right to enforce that you are legally entitled to claim her and her child on your tax return as dependents if they recieve more than half of their support from you support includes living expenses like mortgage rent food utilities and clothing diapers yearly amounts divided by the number of people in the house if there are three of you living in the house and your mortgage is she would have to give you per month div by x her and son div by anything less means that you provide more than half of her living expense just for housing and so on with other expenses if she doesn't cover half of her own expenses she cannot claim eitc at all tell her life isn't fair it isn't fair that you have to provide for a baby that she made in the back seat of a car it isn't fair that you have to babysit a grandchild so she can do whatever it is she does while you're babysitting the same applies if she's or age is irrelevant a dependent is anyone who receives more than half of their support from you  Minimum wage FairTax Taxation in the United States Flat tax Earned income tax credit Insurance Life insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Microeconomics Tax Mortgage Social Security (United States) Bond Personal finance Education in the United States U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Property tax Money Student loan Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Surplus value Economic inequality Credit card Progressive tax Mutual fund Tax protester Tom DeLay National Insurance Corporation Centrelink Tax bracket Unemployment benefit Abortion debate Allodial title Inflation Gross domestic product Poker jargon Capital accumulation Supply-side economics Day care Tax resistance Jizya Theory of conduct Leasing Article One of the United States Constitution Annuity Anarchism and capitalism School choice Labour economics Make money fast Wal-Mart Immigration to the United States Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act MAME GNU General Public License Free trade Knots Landing Child support Salary cap Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Canadian federal election, 1993 Cooperative Health insurance British Royal Family Arguments for and against drug prohibition Copyright Economy of India 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Labor theory of value Motion picture rating system Inheritance tax Economic rent Barrister PGA Tour United States Postal Service Variable universal life insurance Deflation (economics) Keynesian economics Freeters Real estate bubble Dividend Income tax EastEnders Hyperinflation Karl Rove H-1B visa

how many taxes will be taken out of my lawsuit settlement i just won a settlement for compensatory damages and punitive damages how much tax will be taken out of the compensatory i know that the for punitive will not be taxed that depends upon what the settlement is for settlements for physical injury or illness are not taxed if any part of the settlement is earmarked for lost wages interest or punitive damages that portion is fully taxable as ordinary income additionally settlements that simply make you whole again are not taxable for example if an uninsured drunk driver slammed into your house and the settlement was to repair the damage to your home it would not be taxable to the extent that it was used for the actual repairs any amount above and beyond the actual cost of the repairs would be taxable as ordinary income not sure where you heard that punitive damages are not taxable punitive damages are always taxable the only exception to that is if your state's laws prohibit the award of punitive damages in that case they would be treated as compensatory damages and would be taxable or not depending upon the reason for the settlement so without knowing what the settlement was for it's not possible to give an absolute answer to your question  Damages Negligence Insurance Taxation in the United States FairTax Flat tax Tax 401(k) Income tax Microeconomics United Kingdom corporation tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Stella Liebeck v.

co borrowed on mortgage other borrower in higher tax bracket how to make sure he takes of deduction my boyfriend and i just bought a condo we co borrowed on the mortgage we'll be filing taxes separately he's in a higher tax bracket so it would make sense for him to take the entire mortgage interest deduction since he will get more back than i would how do we make sure that can happen i have heard different things about what we should do for example i have heard that the paper trail for the mortgage payment should always be traceable back to him and him alone e g the checks should come from an account that only has his name attached to it i have also heard that we can take that route but that i can actually pay the principal amount out of my funds so long as he pays the interest amount out of his funds and i have heard that we don't have to go through any of this trouble that as long we don't both try to take the entire interest deduction it's fine however we split it does anyone know for sure is there a source with a definitive answer if you're both on the loan you can split it any way you wish if his ssn is on the form from the mortgage company no further action on either of your parts is required if you are splitting the payments give him your share and let him cut the check for the payment  Taxation in the United States Student loan 401(k) Bond Life insurance Flat tax Insurance Mutual fund Bank FairTax Security (finance) Credit card United Kingdom corporation tax Savings and loan association Islamic banking Mortgage-backed security Debt Money Tax Microeconomics Supply-side economics Deflation (economics) Subsidy Primerica Financial Services Income tax Social Security (United States) Bretton Woods system Natural deduction Federal National Mortgage Association Collateralized mortgage obligation Income trust Financial markets Government National Mortgage Association Health insurance Gold standard Personal finance Short selling Public transport Municipal bond Surplus value Tax deduction Capital accumulation Interest Predatory lending Tertiary education fees in Australia Donald Trump Publicly funded medicine Annual percentage rate Treasury security Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Economy of India Mergers and acquisitions Social Security debate (United States) Bank fraud Citigroup Gross domestic product Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Stock Food Stamp Program Concurrent estate Finance Productive and unproductive labour Corporation Logic Tax Reform Act of 1986 Monetary policy Surveillance Federal Reserve Real estate bubble Payroll Money supply Deficit spending Charles Ponzi Fiat money Economy of the United States Toll road Progressive tax Variable universal life insurance Child support Securitization Ponzi scheme Advance fee fraud Registered Retirement Savings Plan Cheque Housing cooperative Cost of capital Interest rate Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Microcredit Operating surplus Tax resistance Dividend Tax bracket

how does social security administration choose who gets what social security number the social security number is a nine digit number in the format the number is divided into three parts the area number the first three digits is assigned by the geographical region prior to cards were issued in local social security offices around the country and the area number represented the office code in which the card was issued this did not necessarily have to be in the area where the applicant lived since a person could apply for their card in any social security office since when ssa began assigning ssns and issuing cards centrally from baltimore the area number assigned has been based on the zip code in the mailing address provided on the application for the original social security card the applicant's mailing address does not have to be the same as their place of residence thus the area number does not necessarily represent the state of residence of the applicant either prior to nor since generally numbers were assigned beginning in the northeast and moving westward so that people on the east coast had the lowest numbers and those on the west coast had the highest numbers as the areas assigned to a locality are exhausted new areas from the pool are assigned so some states have noncontiguous groups of numbers complete list of area number groups from the social security administration the middle two digits are the group number they have no special geographic or data significance but merely serve to break the number into conveniently sized blocks for orderly issuance there is a theory that the two middle digits can be used to identify a person's ethnic background this is debunked as an urban legend on snopes com as well as on the social security administration's website the group numbers range from to however they are not assigned in consecutive order for administrative reasons group numbers are issued in the following order odd numbers from through even numbers from through even numbers from through odd numbers from through as an example group number will be issued before the last four digits are serial numbers they represent a straight numerical sequence of digits from within the group  ZIP Code UK telephone numbering plan Telephone numbering plan Postcode North American Numbering Plan Address (geography) National identification number Compiler optimization Enterprise content management British national identity card Classified information Cross site scripting Password Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus GED Grade (education) RFID United States Postal Service Computer File Allocation Table Unicode CPU cache ISBN Computer numbering formats Plame affair Canadian postal code Post Office box Domain Name System Political subdivisions of New York State E-mail Vehicle registration plate Central processing unit Binary numeral system One-time pad MUMPS Mail Cryptography MAC address Identity document Call sign Postal code Database Yu-Gi-Oh!

just married this year file taxes jointly or seperately hi my husband and i just got married this year i worked full time from jan through june and will be a student for the rest of the year i have also just taken out a student loan for this fall my husband will have worked under the table the entire year so his income is untaxed there is no record technically he does not work oh and he is not a student either we have lived together the entire year how does the dependent thing work and would it be better for us to file jointly or seperately this coming jan bad move to marry a blatant tax evader that made it more likely that he'll be caught and now your assets are fair game for the irs when they go after back taxes and penalties whether to file jointly or not is a small issue compared to the issue of criminality i'd suggest you see a lawyer who deals with tax issues and decide how to handle this you cannot claim a spouse as a dependent there are various rules for claiming other people you support as dependents children parents siblings friends etc but there is no way to claim a spouse as a dependent however each spouse gets one automatic personal exemption which is just as good it is extremely rare that filing separately leads to lower taxes than filing jointly  Flat tax Marriage 401(k) FairTax Divorce Taxation in the United States Tax Student loan Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Inheritance tax Civil unions in the United Kingdom Roth IRA Polygamy 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Tax protester Grief Incest Family Concurrent estate Economic inequality Capital gains tax Rights and responsibilities of marriages in the United States Polyamory Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Property tax Social Security (United States) Pretty Good Privacy Centrelink Insurance Irish nationality law U.S. Internal Revenue Service H-1B visa Tax exemption Theory of conduct Hillary Rodham Clinton History of British nationality law Game programmer Immigration to the United States Constitution of Ireland British Royal Family Same-sex marriage Article One of the United States Constitution Copyright law of the United Kingdom Probate LiveJournal Video game developer CPU cache Lawsuit Philip II of Spain Wal-Mart Poker jargon Unification Church Education in the United States Kyoto Protocol Microeconomics Civil union Slander and libel Royal Assent Appeal Free trade Tax resistance Alimony Cricket Domestic violence Unlawful combatant Allodial title Municipal bond Ethics Age of consent Fischer Random Chess Life insurance Illegal drug trade Bankruptcy Redundant array of independent disks Variable universal life insurance Progressive tax Unemployment benefit Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Blackjack Trust (Law) non-USA Income tax Court system of Canada Regressive tax National Insurance Virtual memory Culture of the United States Daylight saving time Murder British nationality law Federal Marriage Amendment EastEnders Child support Productive and unproductive labour Family name Child pornography Intelligence quotient Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 Enterprise content management
