was lenin as bad as stalin your question calls for an examination of lenin against the benchmark of bad established by stalin that is fine by me i consider stalin on a par with hitler mao and pol pot and maybe a few others in the pantheon of horrible th century dictators my personal opinion is that lenin deserves to be on the same list of horror dictators but to be fair i acknowledge that some marxist leaning historians still cherish his memory let s summarize their pro lenin arguments first see source link for more detail good lenin arguments lenin was a highly principled idealist whose attempts to establish a socialist utopia were thwarted by right wing reactionaries and then ultimately perverted by stalin lenin took land from widely hated landowners and gave it to million oppressed peasants lenin ended huge suffering in russia when he sought and obtained peace from germany lenin wanted political self determination for all races lenin abolished the death penalty in the russian army legalized abortion and divorce and insisted on freedom of speech for the press and for ordinary citizens the reason why the bolsheviks retained power in russia was because most of the russian people firmly supported lenin now for a summary of the anti lenin arguments see source link for more detail bad lenin arguments lenin was indeed an idealist but one with utterly perverted ideals that showed no respect for human rights and liberties a master of doubletalk lenin s public pronouncements were generally for pr purposes only his actions put the lie to his words if lenin had lived longer his tyranny would have proved just as severe and brutal as that of stalin as early as lenin introduced forced slave labor as a standard economic instrument by the first slave labor concentration camps were in place the start of the gulag lenin s secret police the cheka began murdering fellow socialists social revolutionaries and mensheviks from onwards red terror reprisals against political opponents very quickly included the mass execution of hostages the so called alliance of workers and peasants was a mere slogan lenin despised russia s peasants because they stood in the way of his notions for collectivization with the injunction merciless war against the kulaks lenin unleashed the cheka and red army against farmers slaughtering hundreds of thousands lenin s anti peasant campaigns were directly responsible for the famine of in which between million and million died of starvation his words notwithstanding lenin instituted merciless persecution of religion not just the russian orthodox church but also jews catholics and muslims actions speak louder than words as far as i m concerned lenin was no better than stalin and of course without lenin s actions we d probably never have heard of stalin or mao or pol pot we might not even have heard of hitler nazism might have had much less appeal in germany but for the dread of red revolution as an alternative  History of the Soviet Union (1927-1953) History of socialism Nazism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Socialism Workers' Party of Korea The Holocaust Conservatism NKVD Sino-Soviet split Separation of church and state Holocaust denial Liberalism Holodomor World War II Finnish Civil War Khmer Rouge The Black Book of Communism Right-wing politics Capital punishment Weimar Republic Islam as a political movement Russian history, 1892-1920 Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Red Army Vyacheslav Molotov Kulak Past and present anarchist communities Grigory Zinoviev Cheng Feng Appeal Left-wing politics Trotskyism Polish-Soviet War Anarchism in Spain Left-Right politics Religion in the Soviet Union Criticisms of communism History of Poland (1939-1945) Crime against humanity Russia Civil rights Reactionary History of Communist Albania Opus Dei Mahatma Gandhi Democratic Kampuchea Persecution of Christians Simone Weil Abortion debate Russian history, 1855-1892 Kronstadt rebellion October Revolution History of Ukraine History of Europe History of anti-Semitism Capitalism Rosa Luxemburg History of Poland (1945-1989) Kibbutz Gulag Freedom of speech History of the Jews in Poland Ture Nerman

blitzkrieg where were the allies air forces when germany attacked in the west on may the air forces of the allies french british belgians dutch had a substantial combined numerical superiority over the luftwaffe certainly the luftwaffe's aircraft were generally superior plane to plane but the luftwaffe totaled bombers and fighters the total air forces' strength of the allies was bombers and fighters yet on the western front the only place that mattered the luftwaffe enjoyed an almost numerical advantage germany bombers fighters allies bombers fighters i know that the raf held much of its strength back in britain for home defence and both france and britain presumably deployed aircraft for imperial defense in the middle east india se asia etc were the allies so sure that hitler would never dare to attack on the western front that they squandered their aerial numerical superiority in pointless deployments elsewhere some excellent answers but for those that think i was ignoring poland that campaign had finished more than months previously many of the french planes were destroyed on the ground others were busy retreating to airfields that were not threatened quite a lot were in north africa and many more headed there during the biltzkreig however the main problems were organisational the campaign moved far too quickly for the allied command and control structures and the decisive point for the air war was where the stukas were and by the time the allied commanders knew where that was the stukas had moved on as had the blitzkreig only the germans had developed a doctrine of using close air support as flying artillery in support of ground forces and since they didn't understand the doctrine the allies hadn't developed any counter to it another other key factor was the pilots the germans had many experienced pilots who'd flown in spain spanish civil war and then in the polish campaign  World War II Fighter aircraft Royal Air Force Arm__e de l'Air (Part I: From birth to "Torch", 1909-1942) European Theatre of World War II P-51 Mustang Battle of the Bulge Battle of Kursk RAF Bomber Command Norwegian Campaign Battle of Normandy Heinkel He 112 Polish Air Force Technology during World War II Operation Barbarossa Battle of Crete Strategic bombing Namsos campaign Participants in World War II British Home Guard The Blitz Messerschmitt Me 262 Polish contribution to World War II Burma Campaign History of radar Western Front (World War II) Polish Air Forces in France and Great Britain Royal Canadian Air Force Aircraft carrier Napoleonic Wars Operation Market Garden Continuation War Siege of Warsaw (1939) Second Battle of the Atlantic RAF Fighter Command United States Air Force USS Wasp (CV-18) Imperial War Museum Duxford Middle East Theatre of World War II Tunisia Campaign Battle of Berlin Australian 8th Division Aleksandr Ivanovich Pokryshkin History of Poland (1939-1945) Dieppe Raid Western betrayal South-East Asian Theatre of World War II Heinkel He 162 Royal Australian Air Force Dive bomber World War I Messerschmitt Bf 109 Ground attack aircraft Bomber Command Erich von Manstein Japanese strategic planning for the Pacific (1905-1940) Polish-Soviet War B-29 Superfortress Kamikaze Heinkel He 111 4th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Brigade Nederland Aviation in World War I Wehrmacht History of the British Army Operation Torch History of Germany during World War II B-24 Liberator Eastern Front (World War II) Terror bombing Hawker Hurricane Battle of Midway Middle East Campaign Supermarine Spitfire Awards and decorations of Nazi Germany Operation Downfall War of the Austrian Succession Battle of Iwo Jima P-47 Thunderbolt Imperial Japanese Navy Six-Day War W__adys__aw Sikorski Irish neutrality USS Yorktown (CV-10) Battle of Singapore

what is the mystery behind king tut if you are speaking of the curse it is more or less added for drama like in many other cases a good mystery always makes things more interesting although a number of people including a bird died after the opening of the tomb the deaths were spread out over many years if there were really curses then finding a tomb that had not been robbed would not be an exception what made the finding of king tut's tomb so amazing was that it had not been robbed so many other tombs were robbed that the priests actually removed many of the pharaoh's mummies and hid them away in a mass tomb later discovered by archaeologists the main mystery behind king tut was how he died some have said it was murder either through a physical assault or by poison recent research has also indicated another possibility the pharaoh's were expected to master certain skills in driving a chariot injuries to the body of king tut are consistent with a serious fall from a chariot if so it is possible that an infection caused by the injuries specifically a severely broken bone in his leg ended his life as medical knowledge was somewhat limited back then infections were often fatal the bad break that he would have suffered would probably have led to one or more infections and possibly a blood clot each capable of ending his life one answer mentions an abcess tooth which is also possible i have not heard of that but a recent show on the search for the mummy of a queen of egypt used a tooth contained in a burial urn to identify her they were able to match the tooth which had part of the root missing to the part of the tooth left in the mummies mouth based upon the tooth they believe that she died from an infection due to an abcess in the tooth that had been pulled when the tooth was pulled the abcess broke and an infection spread through her body ultimately causing her death  Valley of the Kings Mummy Archaeology Curse of the Pharaohs Nefertiti Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hatshepsut Resurrection of Jesus Kain (Legacy of Kain) History of ancient Egypt Hyksos Chariot Howard Carter Funeral Episodes of Lost (Season 1) John F.

hiroshima equal peace after visiting hiroshima museum i have seen the japanese have down played their role during ww but instead i sensed some hidden message that is asking why the american used the atomic bomb on these cities and are they using japan as a guinea pig on their latest technology every year they repeated the protest about war now can somebody tells me what make america retaliates if is because the japanese bombed pearl harbour what happen if after pearl harbour would the japanese continues to attack america if america did retaliates should read as america did not retaliates about the nanking massacre yes in the museum the japanese put in a figure of to only and further add on however china's figure is joriental i read vaguely and did not find that there 's any declaration by the japanese infact it was surprised attack as written right at the beginning of the web you have provided it was further mentioned on next page that in the japanese foreign minister said the japanese intended to declare war with us just mins b the supposed attack on pearl harbour pls enlighthen further if i missed any point it 's hard to tell if your question asks why america went to war or what america dropped the atomic bomb the hiroshima nagasaki bombs were not 'tests' or 'experimenting' and the decision to use the bombs was not taken lightly us government was more honourable back then it also needs to be remembered that the a bomb was new and little understood technology it was not until years into the cold war that it was fully realised that the a bomb was a whole new moral level of war rather than just another weapon the main reasons the bomb was used were the horrific casualties the allies faced in invading japan japan was obviously defeated from mid but they fought harder and harder fanatically to the last soldier and on okinawa many civilians as well the japanese army revered their emperor as a god and would fight as long as he told them to and he showed no inclination whatsoever to negotiate peace even though the war was utterly futile and destroying japan i am greatly opposed to the use of excessive force in war and the needless killing of civilians but the decision to use the a bomb was absolutely right and the japanese need to ask themselves why they were doing what they did mass murder rape torture chemical warfare experiments militant expansionism compared to germany they have a very unhealthy view of their nation's cations between and  Nuclear weapon Pacific War Strategic bombing Surrender of Japan Hiroshima Military history of the United States RAF Bomber Command Participants in World War II Korean War Cold War Operation Downfall Nuclear warfare Second Sino-Japanese War War Polish September Campaign History of nuclear weapons Attack on Pearl Harbor Bombing of Dresden in World War II Strategic bombing during World War II Japanese war crimes U.S. invasion of Afghanistan Isoroku Yamamoto Winter War 2003 Invasion of Iraq Military history of the Soviet Union God Emperor of Dune Terror bombing Gulf War Franco-Prussian War Battle of Okinawa Iraq War Total war Timeline of World War II Crime against humanity European Theatre of World War II Robert Oppenheimer Chemical warfare Post-invasion Iraq, 2003___2005 Suicide bombing Empire of Japan Japanese militarism Russell-Einstein Manifesto International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement War of 1812 Shock and Awe Japanese history textbook controversies History of Korea (1900___1950) Aerial warfare Trinity test World War II casualties Japanese atomic program USS Ammen (DD-527) USS Yorktown (CV-10) Kosovo War Anti-Japanese sentiment Militia Blitzkrieg Mutual assured destruction United States Air Force Hirohito Nuclear arms race History of the Soviet Union (1927-1953) Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II History of Japan Battle of the Coral Sea Vo Nguyen Giap Lord's Resistance Army B-29 Superfortress History of the United States Bombing of Tokyo in World War II Terrorism in Kashmir Iran's nuclear program Treaty of Versailles Opposition to U.S. foreign policy Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia Peleliu Terrorism against Israel Nagasaki Battle of the Aleutian Islands detailed account Nanking Massacre Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Iran-Iraq War John Sheridan (Babylon 5) War of the Austrian Succession Imperial Japanese Army Sabra and Shatila massacre Battle of Berlin Governments' positions pre-2003 invasion of Iraq

who was jack the ripper if you want the simple sunday schooled version jack the ripper was an anonymous figure of evil who murdered and severely mutilated of whitechapels prostitutes in he was never found and his identity was never discovered now for the in depth stuff this will be long so be prepared i shall review some of the suspects of the case showing you some of the pro s if any and con s of each suspect the most common theory and the most played out in the media is the royal masonic theory i must firstly say that this theory is absurd for many reasons the idea and basis of the theory for those who do not know is that prince albert victor and the story goes that he impregnated an 'unfortunate' a woman a prostitute this infatuation would bring albert to ruin and the child being bred from royal blood would legally gain heirship to the throne this couldn t be done so the royals along with the freemasons would contrive to rid the truth they employed the royal doctor sir william gull as albert was unable to perform the murders himself due to illness to murder those who knew of the truth the infatuation and the child these just happened to be polly nichols annie chapman liz stride catherine eddowes and mary kelly now with the theory explained let me get to the logical bias of this theory first of all the idea of william gull making his way through the streets of whitechapel alone can be dismissed as that as his stature promotes wouldn t have known about the layouts pf the east end the ripper' however clearly knew whitechapel east end and its slums so why not have sir william travel by carriage with an accomplice by the name of netley logically wouldn t someone have heard the loud noise of wheels rolling on cobblestones in the claustrophobic streets of whitechapel yet no one noticed these sounds or made mention of them at the time of the murders another interesting thing to note is that at the time of dark annie's murder a woman saw miss chapman outside hanbury street the place she was killed negotiating with a man most likely the 'ripper' in case you haven t caught on yet the witness saw one man not two she also saw no carriage would it help if i mentioned that the man she saw didn t match any of the royals okay another thing is that if the theory was correct all of the victims knew each other and had a regular friendship it is a known fact that none of the victims knew each other doesn t this throw the theory into shaky realism so why do so many movies such as the comic book adaptation from hell and the earlier tv miniseries 'jack the ripper' base there story and plot on this theory simply because it has the most dramatic interesting and playful affect they make the theory their movie because of the plot value not for truth and accuracy there was never a grape vine found at the scene of the murders mary kelly did in fact die inspector abberline did not know mary kelly no mention or evidence of laudanum or opium was found moving on lets take a look at patricia cornwell s theory of the ripper being the artist walter sickert the theory has the potential to impress the minds of millions worldwide with certain ideas about the ripper crimes which are unfortunately largely inaccurate some of the ideas that tis theory presents is that walter sickert sent the infamous ripper letters to the police taunting them and the media during the murder spree she claims to have conclusively found sickert s dna on one or more of the jack the ripper murders the discovery of watermarks on the ripper letters and sickert letters another idea was that walter sickert inserted clues and symbols about the ripper case into his drawings and paintings some of these clues are so similar to the actual crime scenes that only the true murderer could have painted them now i wont go into detail on each of these speculations but you may be interested in reading this article http www casebook org dissertations dst pamandsickert html it deals with concept vs fact of cornwell s sickert theory now one very contradictory fact about the sickert case is that there are several independent sources of evidence that indicate walter sickert was in france between august and october this automatically throws the theory into fiction truth be said this theory is a lot of tom foolery patricia cornwell bakes up bundles of theories without backing them up with facts now moving on to the black magic theory a theory that believes that jack was a black magic ritualist this theory purports to explain the motive planning and execution of the ripper murders as part of a mystical black magic ritual performed by none other than roslyn donston the theory is that the murders were planned on a map according to an ancient geometric symbol called vesica pisces this is a very bold theory and would be a very bold risk in believing it if the mind permits anyone can connect the murder sites and from some of a letter or sign it s entirely up to the imagination aaron kosminski why do many people follow the path of the english men during the ripper period and blatantly suspect that an ill bred jew committed the atrocities why i ask as for the suspicion it started when one witness identified him as the ripper no charges were brought forward however he was apparently known to have been insane however he was not known to have violent tendencies if i were you i'd do as much research as you can and find a much more worthy and reliable suspect i found one he goes by the name of francis tumblety tumblety the first and earliest notion of this subject came from one of the police officials on the case a mr littlechild who later wrote a letter describing his thoughts and theory and presenting his idea of who the murderer was this letter was only discovered in the twentieth century when a literature collector and librarian was cleaning out his books ridding of any to be sold he came across the letter and dismissed it as another hoax however when he sent it to a ripper collector and ripperologist stephen evans who later sent it for analysis which found the ink and paper to be authentic this letter later became known as the 'littlechild letter' and is the absolute basis of this theory tumblety himself and american doctor or 'quack' as referred to in the letter was known to be a hater of women a misogynist this man made regular visits to london one of which was in at the time of the murders known to have disguised himself on various occasions now for the interesting parts strong evidence against him was that tumblty collected uteruses preserving them and such annie chapman's uterus was taken more interesting to note is that on the night of the double murders of stride and eddowes upon tumblety's returning to his lodge house the lodging lady discovered that his clothes had visible bloodstains on them he was arrested on november th on charges of gross indecency and indecent assault with force and arms against four men between july th and november these eight charges were euphemisms for homosexual activities tumblety was then charged on suspicion of the whitechapel murders on the th suggested he was free to kill kelly between the th and th tumblety was bailed on november th a hearing was held on november th at the old bailey and the trial postponed until december th tumblety then fled to france under the alias frank townsend on the th and from there took the steamer la bretagne to new york city tumblety fits many requirements of what we now know as the serial killer profile he had a supposed hatred of women and prostitutes the abortion with the prostitute dumas his alleged failed marriage to an ex prostitute his collection of uteri etc tumblety was in london at the time and may indeed have been the infamous batty street lodger he therefore may have had fair knowledge of the east end environs tumblety may have had some anatomical knowledge as inferred by his collection of wombs his medical practice and his short term work with dr lispenard in rochester he was arrested in the midst of the autumn of terror on suspicion of having committed the murders there were no more murders after he fled england on the th november if one counts only the canonical five murders chief inspector littlechild a top name in scotland yard believed him a very likely suspect and he was not alone in his convictions tumblety was fond of using aliases disappearing without a trace and was the subject of police enquiries before his arrest scotland yard and the american police had been in touch numerous times concerning tumblety s flight from france to new york one of the three detectives inspectors assigned to the case was sent to new york at the same time perhaps to pursue tumblety tumblety evaded capture in new york city once again tumblety had the wealth necessary for frequent travel and could afford to change his clothes frequently should they have become bloodstained he was an eccentric but shrewd he had a tendency toward violence at times and his career may have included other offences both at home and abroad several acquaintances of his in america believed it likely that he was the ripper when interviewed in this is where i m going to leave it and yet i have not mentioned joseph barnett or james maybrick and his diary cheers

do you believe this john henry story steel drivin' men like john henry used large hammers and stakes to pound holes into the rock which were then filled with explosives that would blast a cavity deeper and deeper into the mountain in the folk ballads the central event took place under such conditions eager to reduce costs and speed up progress some tunnel engineers were using steam drills to power their way into the rock according to some accounts on hearing of the machine john henry challenged the steam drill to a contest he won but died of exhaustion his life cut short by his own superhuman effort i have read enough primary sources to give john henry his due and accept this as a true tale several similar tales surfaced during the transition from muscle to machines and considering the vagarities of modern machinery and factoring in the crudeness of the early steam drills can imagine a man beating machine note how impatient people have become during the time of michaelangelo people were content to drill pound a hole pour in water let freezing do its thing even if the process had to be repeated over weeks or months to free up a block of marble hammers and drills gave way to explosinves and then steam drills and then steam drills explosives were combined for the most efficient use of time there was seriously talk in usa and ussr during the 's to use small atomic bombs to dig deeper mines and extract ores etc pax  Drill bit Energy development Internal ballistics Casting Industrial Revolution Seismic retrofit Nuclear weapon design Rapid transit Explosive material Petroleum Steel Welding Future energy development Carburetor Derbyshire lead mining history Project Orion Iron Robot Master Terminal ballistics Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Hydrogen economy Pebble bed reactor Opportunity rover Steam engine Metallurgy Screw John Henry (folklore) Oil well 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Ice core Second Battle of the Atlantic Jet engine Drill Alternative fuel Printed circuit board Solar cell Naval mine Fusion power Wood Locomotive Transformers: Cybertron History of the Panama Canal Fuel injection Mining Floppy disk Two-stroke cycle Black hole Furnace Nuclear fission Worms weapons and tools M16 (rifle) Gaillard Cut Nuclear weapon Coal mining Geyser Nuclear explosion RMS Titanic Gravity Tractor Inertial confinement fusion Torpedo Titanium Gold standard Trench warfare Supernova Rail terminology Forge Vacuum Industrial engineering B-47 Stratojet Microeconomics USS Yorktown (CV-5) Weight training Woodworking Pile Half-Life 2 Tenshinhan Technology Engine Drilling and threading Coal Scientology beliefs and practices Nuclear reactor Chernobyl accident Weapon Derrick (lifting device) Wind turbine Attack on Pearl Harbor Poker jargon Environmental concerns with electricity generation Swimming

who was jack the ripper if you want the simple sunday schooled version jack the ripper was an anonymous figure of evil who murdered and severely mutilated of whitechapels prostitutes in he was never found and his identity was never discovered now for the in depth stuff this will be long so be prepared i shall review some of the suspects of the case showing you some of the pro s if any and con s of each suspect the most common theory and the most played out in the media is the royal masonic theory i must firstly say that this theory is absurd for many reasons the idea and basis of the theory for those who do not know is that prince albert victor and the story goes that he impregnated an 'unfortunate' a woman a prostitute this infatuation would bring albert to ruin and the child being bred from royal blood would legally gain heirship to the throne this couldn t be done so the royals along with the freemasons would contrive to rid the truth they employed the royal doctor sir william gull as albert was unable to perform the murders himself due to illness to murder those who knew of the truth the infatuation and the child these just happened to be polly nichols annie chapman liz stride catherine eddowes and mary kelly now with the theory explained let me get to the logical bias of this theory first of all the idea of william gull making his way through the streets of whitechapel alone can be dismissed as that as his stature promotes wouldn t have known about the layouts pf the east end the ripper' however clearly knew whitechapel east end and its slums so why not have sir william travel by carriage with an accomplice by the name of netley logically wouldn t someone have heard the loud noise of wheels rolling on cobblestones in the claustrophobic streets of whitechapel yet no one noticed these sounds or made mention of them at the time of the murders another interesting thing to note is that at the time of dark annie's murder a woman saw miss chapman outside hanbury street the place she was killed negotiating with a man most likely the 'ripper' in case you haven t caught on yet the witness saw one man not two she also saw no carriage would it help if i mentioned that the man she saw didn t match any of the royals okay another thing is that if the theory was correct all of the victims knew each other and had a regular friendship it is a known fact that none of the victims knew each other doesn t this throw the theory into shaky realism so why do so many movies such as the comic book adaptation from hell and the earlier tv miniseries 'jack the ripper' base there story and plot on this theory simply because it has the most dramatic interesting and playful affect they make the theory their movie because of the plot value not for truth and accuracy there was never a grape vine found at the scene of the murders mary kelly did in fact die inspector abberline did not know mary kelly no mention or evidence of laudanum or opium was found moving on lets take a look at patricia cornwell s theory of the ripper being the artist walter sickert the theory has the potential to impress the minds of millions worldwide with certain ideas about the ripper crimes which are unfortunately largely inaccurate some of the ideas that tis theory presents is that walter sickert sent the infamous ripper letters to the police taunting them and the media during the murder spree she claims to have conclusively found sickert s dna on one or more of the jack the ripper murders the discovery of watermarks on the ripper letters and sickert letters another idea was that walter sickert inserted clues and symbols about the ripper case into his drawings and paintings some of these clues are so similar to the actual crime scenes that only the true murderer could have painted them now i wont go into detail on each of these speculations but you may be interested in reading this article http www casebook org dissertations dst pamandsickert html it deals with concept vs fact of cornwell s sickert theory now one very contradictory fact about the sickert case is that there are several independent sources of evidence that indicate walter sickert was in france between august and october this automatically throws the theory into fiction truth be said this theory is a lot of tom foolery patricia cornwell bakes up bundles of theories without backing them up with facts now moving on to the black magic theory a theory that believes that jack was a black magic ritualist this theory purports to explain the motive planning and execution of the ripper murders as part of a mystical black magic ritual performed by none other than roslyn donston the theory is that the murders were planned on a map according to an ancient geometric symbol called vesica pisces this is a very bold theory and would be a very bold risk in believing it if the mind permits anyone can connect the murder sites and from some of a letter or sign it s entirely up to the imagination aaron kosminski why do many people follow the path of the english men during the ripper period and blatantly suspect that an ill bred jew committed the atrocities why i ask as for the suspicion it started when one witness identified him as the ripper no charges were brought forward however he was apparently known to have been insane however he was not known to have violent tendencies if i were you i'd do as much research as you can and find a much more worthy and reliable suspect i found one he goes by the name of francis tumblety tumblety the first and earliest notion of this subject came from one of the police officials on the case a mr littlechild who later wrote a letter describing his thoughts and theory and presenting his idea of who the murderer was this letter was only discovered in the twentieth century when a literature collector and librarian was cleaning out his books ridding of any to be sold he came across the letter and dismissed it as another hoax however when he sent it to a ripper collector and ripperologist stephen evans who later sent it for analysis which found the ink and paper to be authentic this letter later became known as the 'littlechild letter' and is the absolute basis of this theory tumblety himself and american doctor or 'quack' as referred to in the letter was known to be a hater of women a misogynist this man made regular visits to london one of which was in at the time of the murders known to have disguised himself on various occasions now for the interesting parts strong evidence against him was that tumblty collected uteruses preserving them and such annie chapman's uterus was taken more interesting to note is that on the night of the double murders of stride and eddowes upon tumblety's returning to his lodge house the lodging lady discovered that his clothes had visible bloodstains on them he was arrested on november th on charges of gross indecency and indecent assault with force and arms against four men between july th and november these eight charges were euphemisms for homosexual activities tumblety was then charged on suspicion of the whitechapel murders on the th suggested he was free to kill kelly between the th and th tumblety was bailed on november th a hearing was held on november th at the old bailey and the trial postponed until december th tumblety then fled to france under the alias frank townsend on the th and from there took the steamer la bretagne to new york city tumblety fits many requirements of what we now know as the serial killer profile he had a supposed hatred of women and prostitutes the abortion with the prostitute dumas his alleged failed marriage to an ex prostitute his collection of uteri etc tumblety was in london at the time and may indeed have been the infamous batty street lodger he therefore may have had fair knowledge of the east end environs tumblety may have had some anatomical knowledge as inferred by his collection of wombs his medical practice and his short term work with dr lispenard in rochester he was arrested in the midst of the autumn of terror on suspicion of having committed the murders there were no more murders after he fled england on the th november if one counts only the canonical five murders chief inspector littlechild a top name in scotland yard believed him a very likely suspect and he was not alone in his convictions tumblety was fond of using aliases disappearing without a trace and was the subject of police enquiries before his arrest scotland yard and the american police had been in touch numerous times concerning tumblety s flight from france to new york one of the three detectives inspectors assigned to the case was sent to new york at the same time perhaps to pursue tumblety tumblety evaded capture in new york city once again tumblety had the wealth necessary for frequent travel and could afford to change his clothes frequently should they have become bloodstained he was an eccentric but shrewd he had a tendency toward violence at times and his career may have included other offences both at home and abroad several acquaintances of his in america believed it likely that he was the ripper when interviewed in this is where i m going to leave it and yet i have not mentioned joseph barnett or james maybrick and his diary

us won wwii and saved the world here in the uk we are aware of some derogotary feeling from the us having to win ww for us the british this is my hypothesis if the uk had rolled over and been defeated in hitler would have held all of europe and our teritories including india austrailia a lot of africa etc with the japs winning in burma and asia with no australian or british resistance germany and japan would have help the whole world outside the us hitler would not have been fighting on fronts against russia russia would have japs and germans on each side and would have folded no matter how strong the us is it could not have resisted the rest of the world german and japan on each side so if we hadnt resisted carpet bombing of civilians if we had collaborated at first the us has us to thank their not talking japaneese but we did need your financial support and we probably wouldnt have won without you just had to point out we won the war too ps must add what a brilliant thing is that we won if you want to hear something truely inspirational typein winston churchil speech on youtube im and this was a long time ago but im choking back the tears when i think of what we all went through to win the fight for democracy and good nb amanda ann churchil was not for a treaty neville chamberlin and his government were all for apeasment churchill was the only man with the bottle to stand up and look hiltler straight in the eye and say nein yep it's unlikely the us alone could have beaten nazi germany and imperial japan in fact it boarders on not bloody likely history unfortunately gets watered down and what gets taught it sometimes specific to a country and filtered by current events you had to look long and hard in the 's and 's to find any reference in the west that the soviets deserve a major share of credit in beating hitler and as far as winston and a tear to the eye this from an american historian probably our best william manchester the french had collapsed the dutch had been overwhelmed the belgians had surrendered the british army trapped fought free and fell back toward the channel ports converging on a fishing town whose name was then spelled dunkerque behind them lay the sea it was england s greatest crisis since the norman conquest vaster than those precipitated by philip ii s spanish armada louis xiv s triumphant armies or napoleon s invasion barges massed at boulogne this time britain stood alone if the germans crossed the channel and established uncontested beachheads all would be lost for it is a peculiarity of england s island that its southern weald is indefensible against disciplined troops now the tommies at dunkirk britain s only hope seemed doomed on the flanders beaches they stood around in angular existential attitudes like dim purgatorial souls awaiting disposition there appeared to be no way to bring more than a handful of them home the royal navy s vessels were inadequate king george vi has been told that they would be lucky to save the house of commons was warned to prepare for hard and heavy tidings then from the streams and estuaries of kent and dover a strange fleet appeared trawlers and tugs scows and fishing sloops lifeboats and pleasure craft smacks and coasters the island ferry grade fields tom sopwith s america s cup challenger endeavour even the london fire brigade s fire float massey shaw all of them manned by civilian volunteers english fathers sailing to rescue england s exhausted bleeding sons even today what followed seems miraculous not only were britain s soldiers delivered so were french support troops a total of men but wars are not won by fleeing from the enemy and british morale was still unequal to the imminent challenge these were the same people who less than a year earlier had rejoiced in the fake peace bought by the betrayal of czechoslovakia at munich most of their leaders and most of the press remained craven it had been over a thousand years since alfred the great had made himself and his countrymen one and sent them into battle transformed now in this new exigency confronted by the mightiest conqueror europe had ever known england looked for another alfred a figure cast in a mold which by the time of the dunkirk deliverance seemed to have been forever lost england s new leader were he to prevail would have to stand for everything england s decent civilized establishment had rejected they viewed adolf hitler as the product of complex social and historical forces their successor would have to be a passionate manichaean who saw the world as a medieval struggle to the death between the powers of good and the powers of evil who held that individuals are responsible for their actions and that the german dictator was therefore wicked a believer in martial glory was required one who saw splendor in the ancient parades of victorious legions through persepolis and could rally the nation to brave the coming german fury an embodiment of fading victorian standards was wanted a tribune for honor loyalty duty and the supreme virtue of action one who would never compromise with iniquity who could create a sublime mood and thus give men heroic visions of what they were and might become like adolf hitler he would have to be a leader of intuitive genius a born demagogue in the original sense of the word a believer in the supremacy of his race and his national destiny an artist who knew how to gather the blazing light of history into his prism and then distort it to his ends an embodiment of inflexible resolution who could impose his will and his imagination on his people a great tragedian who understood the appeal of martyrdom and could tell his followers the worst hurling it to them like great hunks of bleeding meat persuading them that the year of dunkirk would be one in which it was equally good to live or to die who could if necessary be just as cruel just as cunning and just as ruthless as hitler but who could win victories without enslaving populations or preaching supernaturalism or foisting off myths of his infallibility or destroying or even warping the libertarian institutions he had sworn to preserve such a man if he existed would be england s last chance in london there was such a man  Scots Guards Darth Vader Peleliu Hannibal Military history of the Soviet

before modern technology how did a low middle income family feed itself during the winter i'm thinking about britain but if you know about an area that is similarly seasonal your info is welcome so what i'm wondering is what did people eat during the winter did every family have its own food store or was it managed by a town or a local ruler how did people ration it out and what were the economics involved it's just a matter of curiosity in the period i study earl modern england and europe most towns had their own grain store which was managed by the town or city corporations councillors aldermen mayors etc in times of bad harvest these corporations would monopolise the local stocks and only pay such suppliers as there was set prices thereby ensuring the poor of the town were not priced out of the market some were more effectual than others in managing the supply and demand there are many instances of grain riots in england and europe at times when the corporations had not responded to the crisis quickly enough other towns were models of organisation e g lille now in france then in the walloon province of flanders as for individual stores it is hard to know but i have recently studied accounts for a lower gentry family in early seventeenth century and they were buying enough grain to last a couple of months at once therefore they must have had to store it somewhere those on lower incomes would obviously not have been able to buy as much grain at once as for perishables low income families in rural areas would have fed themselves by slaughtering and preserving their own animals getting dairy from their own cattle eggs from their own hens and vegetables preserved from the summer harvest most rural dwellers would have enough land even if its just leased for one or two animals larger local landowners would have also supplied them at a cost of course  Famine Microeconomics Agriculture Supply and demand Gold standard Agriculture in Australia Capitalism Vegetarianism Livestock Wal-Mart Common Agricultural Policy Free trade Natural monopoly Alcohol fuel Economic history of Canada Organic food Tesco Organic farming Shrimp farm Capital accumulation Food Economy of Africa Labour economics Money Monopoly History of the United States (1918-1945) Economics Inflation Sears Holdings Corporation Tax Economy of Belgium Hyperinflation Kosher foods Mutual fund Economy of the United States Biodiesel Supply-side economics Commodity markets Economy of Russia Privatization Economy of India Rise of the New Imperialism Veganism Family farm Management Monetary policy Mercantilism 1973 oil crisis Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Asian financial crisis Protestant Reformation Economy of Pakistan Corporate governance Milk Local government in the United Kingdom Farmers' Alliance Great Famine of 1315-1317 Industrial Revolution Publicly funded medicine Black Death Intellectual property Medieval demography Food storage Management information system Dawson Creek, British Columbia Berkshire Hathaway Unemployment United Kingdom corporation tax Factory farming Illegal drug trade Kashrut Economy of the Soviet Union Deforestation MMORPG Monopoly (game) Tariff Labor theory of value Local food Cable television Flat tax Externality Serfdom Arbitrage Habsburg Spain Domestic rabbit Bank Digital photography Economy of the People's Republic of China Law of value American individualist anarchism Education in the People's Republic of China Nuclear power

what are rules or regulations guiding the puritan society in 's 's the central tenet of puritanism was god's supreme authority over human affairs particularly in the church and especially as expressed in the bible this view led them to seek both individual and corporate conformance to the teaching of the bible and it led them to pursue both moral purity down to the smallest detail as well as ecclesiastical purity to the highest level puritan culture emphasized the need for self examination and the strict accounting for one s feelings as well as one s deeds this was the center of evangelical experience which women in turn placed at the heart of their work to sustain family life the pilgrims the separatist congregationalist puritans who went to north america are likewise famous for banning from their new england colonies many secular entertainments such as games of chance maypoles and drama all of which were perceived as kinds of immorality at the level of the church body the puritans believed that the worship in the church ought to be strictly regulated by what is commanded in the bible known as the regulative principle of worship the puritans condemned as idolatry many worship practices regardless of the practices' antiquity or widespread adoption among christians which their opponents defended with tradition like some of reformed churches on the european continent puritan reforms were typified by a minimum of ritual and decoration and by an unambiguous emphasis on preaching like the early church fathers they eliminated the use of musical instruments in their worship services for various theological and practical reasons another important distinction was the puritan approach to church state relations they opposed the anglican idea of the supremacy of the monarch in the church erastianism and following calvin they argued that the only head of the church in heaven or earth is christ not the pope or the monarch however they believed that secular governors are accountable to god not through the church but alongside it to protect and reward virtue including true religion and to punish wrongdoers a policy that is best described as non interference rather than separation of church and state other notable beliefs include an emphasis on private study of the bible a desire to see education and enlightenment for the masses especially so they could read the bible for themselves the priesthood of all believers simplicity in worship the exclusion of vestments images candles etc did not celebrate traditional holidays that they believed to be in violation of the regulative principle of worship believed the sabbath was still obligatory for christians although they believe the sabbath had been changed to sunday  Eucharist Homosexuality and Christianity United States religious history Christian Reconstructionism History of Christianity Unitarian Universalism Christian right Christian denomination Jehovah's Witnesses John Wesley Mormonism and Christianity John Wycliffe Theology Separation of church and state in the United States Paul of Tarsus Liberal Christianity Cultural and historical background of Jesus Mary, the mother of Jesus Heresy Infant baptism Colonial America Mormonism and Judaism Ordination of women Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Lollardy Reform Judaism Dispensationalism Christian Halakha Asceticism Christian theological controversy Idolatry in Christianity God Bishop Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Martin Luther Biblical canon New Testament Religion and sexuality Catholicism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Methodism High church Messianic Judaism George Fox Religious conversion Christianity and anti-Semitism Trinity Easter Legalism (theology) Clergy Book of Mormon Sacrifice Catechism Christian eschatology Religion and sexual orientation Soul Reincarnation Same-sex marriage Unitarianism God and gender Satanism

was the 'boston tea party' a protest against duty on tea or actually the taking of the duty off i was taught at school that the boston tea party was about a bunch of colonists dressing up as native americans and dumping a cargo of tea into the harbour in protest about duty on the import more recently someone told me that actually the colonists were smugglers who were upset was a reduction in duty was damaging their livelihood your original understanding is correct at least in the main but it probably is missing the larger picture here's a couple of key things most people are unaware of the tea party was not part of the basic plan of the sons of liberty who ended up dumping it it was a last minute makeshift a what they were trying to do was to prevent its landing and force the ships to leave with the tea the ship owners were actually willing to do so but governor hutchinson refused permission for him to leave b the final decision to dump the tea was made because the clock ran out according to the law once the ship had been there for days the duty on the tea had to be paid the th day was about to end for the first of the ships the dartmouth at midnight of the night of the tea party december since this tax duty was precisely the thing that they were all unified in protest about regardless of any additional economic motives some may have had they believed they could not let this happen this fact disproves the contention that it was not about the duty c another evidence of the fact that neither theft nor destruction of property was the intent the participants took great care not to harm any individuals nor to damage anything except the tea in fact the made sure that some minor accidental damage was repaired they also returned to make sure that none of the tea was taken away the protest going on in boston was basically the same as that in all the major port cities at the end of colonists in new york philadelphia and charles town were likewise seeking to prevent the landing of the tea through scaring shipowners and esp through convincing the merchants who were supposed to receive the tea consignees all of whom british authorities had chosen from those they regarded as loyal not to take it results in new york and philadelphia the tea was turned back in charles town the tea landed but was locked up in a storehouse for a few years until revolutionaries took it to sell to raise money for the war effort the difference in boston was that governor hutchinson was more stubborn and his family members who were consignees did not back down if you know something of the stamp act and how that was protested you'll see that the colonists were attempting to do very much the same thing the plan was not to destroy merchandise but to boycott it and do note that as with the stamp act there was widespread agreement on this boycott effort it was not the act of a handful of 'wealthy smugglers' also many american merchants felt threatened by the whole program since it involved creating a monopoly and an effort to dump tea pun intended on the american market which would help the powerful british merchants of the east india company but could drive american merchants out business what was to prevent the same thing happening for any other goods in other words the struggle here was one piece of a larger one that involved representation authority to taxes etc but also the issue of free trade britain basically had complete say over american trade by law restricting them in many areas to trading only with the mother country  Boston Tea Party

i want to know about the change iwitnessed in the socio religious issues during the late century to early my question is related to history are talking about ideological changes in europe from the 's to 's well if you are the th century was the later end of the period of the enlightenment in europe figures like thomas jefferson believed god to be nature which was a contrast from the time of michelangelo's bearded man this view of god is also seen in the u s declaration of independence when it mentions the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and nature's god entitle them this view of god and religion in general is actually part of the rise of nationalism and the secular state in the th century also the years war ended with the treaty of westphalia in and thus ended papal domination over other countries so westphalia also had a huge affect on the change of religion in the th century fun stuff the th century had the most wars in all of history this sort of contributed to a decline in organized religion but they still dominated thought until the th century darwin who wrote the book on the origin of species had a profound effect on how people viewed survival of organisms eventually darwin's theory of natural selection was applied to humans later on and eventually acquired a following in the th century the most dominant western theme though in the th century was manifest destiny and the white man's burden which were both part of imperialism and expansion manifest destiny refered to the united states and how it was destined to expand to the pacific ocean by god the white man's burden was actually a poem written by rudyard kipling but sums up the view of europe during the th century europe believed that it was the white men's duty to guide the uncivilized world to become civilized it was basically a ideological justification for imperialism and it was dictated by god as well  State Manifest Destiny History of United States imperialism Social Darwinism History of Europe Evolutionism Age of Enlightenment Creationism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Nationalism Religion The Origin of Species Patriotism Conservatism The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Liberalism Meaning of life Western world Separation of church and state in the United States Sociocultural evolution Religious pluralism Republic Political philosophy Separation of church and state Jewish principles of faith Friedrich Schleiermacher Secularism Dark Ages History of creationism Scouting Origin belief Creation-evolution controversy History of Christianity Eastern philosophy Animism Religious conversion Imperialism Natural selection Supernatural The Decline of the West The White Man's Burden Historicity of Jesus Pacifism Franz Boas American exceptionalism Ideology Teach the Controversy Civilization Italian Renaissance Intelligent design Philosophy Feminism Protestant Reformation Taoism Book of Mormon Modern world Democracy New Imperialism Social justice Atheism Peace of Westphalia Karl Marx History of the United States Species Predestination Meme Religion and sexual orientation Human David Hume Culture Guns, Germs, and Steel Trinity History of evolutionary thought Reinhold Niebuhr History of philosophy Protestantism Western philosophy Foreign policy of Japan Civil rights Fundamentalism Religious Society of Friends Urantia Coercion Causality Publication of Darwin's theory Phillip E.

how did hitler's coming into power result in the destruction of democracy with all due respect to some of the others who have answered this question they are misinformed adolf hitler was not voted into office he lost the election but other members of the nazi party won the majority of the parliamentary seats and threatened to basically shut down the government unless hitler was given the chancellor's seat that was the first step toward the destruction of democracy as time went on and he promised the people better living conditions and a better job market and began to make good on some of these promises creating more jobs by building a highway system etc he was slowly voted more and more power until eventually democracy was nothing more then a fond memory  President of Germany Paul von Hindenburg National Socialist German Workers Party Weimar Republic Democracy Elections in the United Kingdom Centre Party (Germany) Bundestag (Germany) Adolf Hitler Politics of Germany Parliament of the United Kingdom Neville Chamberlain Prime Minister of Canada Weimar constitution Parliament of Canada Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany Prime Minister Canadian House of Commons Plurality electoral system Politics of Singapore Election Liberal Party (UK) House of Lords Ontario New Democratic Party Indian general elections, 2004 Dominant-party system United Kingdom general election, 2005 Parliamentary system Politics of the United Kingdom Politics of Canada British House of Commons Head of state Reichstag fire Article 48 Proportional representation Unreformed House of Commons Constitution of Austria German federal election, 2005 Motion of Confidence Presidential system Australian legislative election, 2004 Politics of Austria Canadian federal election, 1993 President History of Hungary Night of the Long Knives Anschluss Canadian federal election, 2004 Heinrich Br__ning Schutzstaffel European Theatre of World War II Politics of Bangladesh Racial policy of Nazi Germany Alliance '90/The Greens Cabinet of the United Kingdom Elections in the United States Westminster System Ludwig Kaas Gerrymandering Social Credit Party of Canada Michael Howard British National Party Iraqi legislative election, January 2005 Additional Member System New Zealand Parliament Social Democratic Party of Germany New Zealand elections Motion of no confidence Appeasement William Lyon Mackenzie King European Parliament Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Greek legislative election, 2004 Two-party system Oswald Mosley James Callaghan Central African Republic elections, 2005 Parliament of Finland Ethiopian general elections, 2005 Single Transferable Vote Australian Senate Spanish transition to democracy Freedom Party of Austria Gleichschaltung Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus New Democratic Party Lord Chancellor Norwegian parliamentary election, 2005 United States House of Representatives Speaker of the British House of Commons United States Senate Nazi Germany Head of government Japan general election, 2005 Independence Party (Iceland) National Council of Austria Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Politics of Hong Kong

who was the designer of the sliding sash window and when were they first used its an english adaptation of a dutch idea with a french name the origins the design probably derived from the much simpler horizontal sliding sash commonly known as the 'yorkshire sash' for many years it was believed that the vertical design had originated in holland during the later part of the seventeenth century others claimed it to be of french origin as the word 'sash' is derived from the french word 'chassis' meaning frame however the french sash had not yet developed counter balancing and the sliding sash frame was held in place by a swivel block the earliest recorded account may be that of w horman who in his 'vulgaria' wrote glasen wyndowis let in the lyght i have many prety wyndowes shette with levys goynge up and down certainly toward the end of the seventeenth century sash windows were apparent in england examples include chatsworth house c kensington palace and hampton court palace the counter weighted sash window that we know today however was introduced to the country by sir christopher wrens master joiner thomas kinward whilst working at whitehall palace with the royal patronage and adoption by wren wooden sash windows soon became a fashionable status symbol across britain and the colonies many earlier casement windows were replaced and sliding sash windows were used almost exclusively in new buildings from royal palaces to simple cottages the sash ruled supreme and remained popular until the earlier part of this century the sash offered many advantages including being better suited to the wet british climate as it can be closed down to a narrow gap allowing for good ventilation whilst reducing the chance of rain entering being contained within the box the sashes are less susceptible to distortion and rot than a hinged casement adding greatly to their life span aesthetically the sash is constructed from delicate sections of wood with large areas of glass that add a certain grace even when open they do not detract from the facade as an open casement does georgian architecture embraced sash windows wholeheartedly improving the design from a single moving sash with the top being fixed to the more familiar system of two moveable sashes oak was the common timber used for construction with thick glazing bars to hold the small valuable crown glass panes made by blowing the 'bulls eye' formed at the centre by this manufacturing technique was commonly used at the rear of buildings as glass manufacture improved larger panes started to appear and the classic georgian design consisting of six over six panes with narrow glazing bars became the norm for the victorians box sash windows were a central focus to the character of their buildings inside and out they lavished ornamentation and decoration on their homes curved horns multi arched heads intricate mouldings leaded lights and latticework started to appear in the sashes which were often grouped into impressive bays and offset with ornate stone reveals graduating the size of windows from the ground upwards not only improved the perspective but also increased the amount of light to the lower rooms by the turn of the century the sash was the most widely used window but since the first world war their popularity has been in decline this decline is probanly due to the labour costs involved in their manufacture when compared to the easily mass produced wooden or metal casement window i will not even go into the era of upvc what a move backwards  Buckingham Palace Wood carving Wood Drill bit Equine conformation View camera Solar power Gramophone record Seismic retrofit Mattress Gothic Revival architecture Chatsworth House Trombone Guitar Bass guitar Passenger car Welding Pottery Headlight Violin Internal ballistics Wind turbine TGV Clarinet Sicilian Baroque Dog agility Palace of Westminster Microeconomics Blenheim Palace Station wagon John Hancock Tower Wayne Corporation Timber framing Mercantilism Floppy disk Elevator Gothic architecture Bicycle Freedom Tower Japanese tea ceremony Fan (implement) St Albans Cathedral Mouse (computing) Lathe McMansion Classical order Tank Edward Lovett Pearce Bicycle frame Hawaiian architecture Lighting Anchor Stereoscopy Tudorbethan architecture Baroque architecture Car body style Digital photography Architecture of the California missions Stairway Cello Sport rowing Bassoon Helicopter Boxing Piano Transformer Rail tracks Central processing unit Rococo Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Bath Country house Compact disc Glasses Scale model Molding (decorative) Palazzo Pitti San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Casting Radar Phonograph Hamster Stave church Professional wrestling holds Quotation mark Industrial Revolution Modernism

how did nationalism contribute to world war i and ii has it done more good or bad for the world just for fun remember nationalism can be traced back further than napoleon to the american revolution and the french revolution i would even put forth that nationalism could be traced back to the english civil war of and the treaty of westphalia in maybe nationalism is said to have started with napoleon bonaparte who forged france into a united country until then the french language was not even the national language there were at least local dialects it contributed to both world wars in the sense that people were united and encouraged to fight based on national goals or national affronts as in someone was trying to take away something that was rightfully theirs most usually land bear in mind that there are different flavors of nationalism including religious and ethnic i am refering here to nationalism based on citizenship in my opinion nationalism is a good thing when it is used to protect the people of a country for example people may unite in national sympathy when a natural disaster strikes or when the country is being invaded nationalism is a bad thing however when it is used i would argue misused to rally a people to take the offensive hitler did this as did nearly all the nations during world war i it could be argued that bush did this to convince the american people of the need to invade iraq and by the way dee sznutts doesn't know what nationalism and socialism mean if that's his true answer  Jew State Napoleonic Wars Liberalism Nationalism History of Europe History of Germany House of Bourbon Democracy Germany Anglosphere French Revolution Axis Powers War of 1812 Franco-Prussian War Appeasement Napoleon I of France Property (ownership right) Patriotism Theory of conduct Iraq disarmament crisis European Theatre of World War II French Revolutionary Wars Pacifism Kurdish people Enlightenment Spain History of the United States France Goodness and value theory The UN Security Council and the Iraq war Romantic nationalism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Nazism Causes of World War I Napoleonic code Anti-French sentiment in the United States Participants in World War II French colonial empires Winter War First French Empire Flanders Allies of World War II World War I American Revolutionary War Religion Franco-American relations Civil war Second French Empire League of Nations Criticisms of the War on Terrorism Propaganda Military history of France Teach the Controversy Media bias George W.

who was more cruel vlad the impaler or hitler you see vlad the impaler used to impale his enemies by sticking long polls up their asses or through their chests and left them hanging he also had the breasts of women cut off and their sexual organs removed he also would dine next to his enemies that were impaled dip his bread in their blood and slurp it down it was cruel what he did but it can be understood that he was doing this against his enemies and anyone that stood against him and threatened his power now hitler on the other hand had his enemies executed by gas or shooting or even torture but all that seems to be more humane it is true that hitler had more people killed than vlad the impaler but not in the same sadistic manner personally i think vlad the impaler was not cruel or insane but rather justified in his actions hitler on the other hand was insane and in no possible way justified in any of his actions so who was more cruel vlad the impaler or hitler as usual most of the stories of historical figures are distorted by time and half truths contrary to popular belief vlad the impaler never dined next to the corpses of his enemies nor did he ingest their blood he was the ruler of one of the smallest countries in europe at the time and therefor had one of the smallest armies wallachia vlad's kingdom no it wasn't transylvania was right along the turkish border the turks who spent hundreds of years trying to expand their territory into europe had one of the largest armies of the time vlad's only hope for survival and the survival of his country was to go all out to frighten his enemies he would line the roads that the invading armies would have to travel with impaled prisoners from their previous attacks sometime thousands of them to make matters worse for him just as the turks were backing off a little the hungarians starting attacking him the cruelty of vlad the impaler or vlad tepes or vlad dracula although greatly exaggerated was certainly justified and necessary hitler's actions can only be attributed to irrational hatred and as you've said insanity  Dracula Wallachia Romania in the Middle Ages Bram Stoker The Holocaust Moldavian Magnate Wars Vlad II Dracul Torture Matthias Corvinus of Hungary The Historian Impalement Rise of the Ottoman Empire Ravenloft domains Siege of Vienna Erzs__bet B__thory Vampire Green Goblin First Crusade Winter War Capital punishment Hungary Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Assassination World War I Eastern Front (World War II) History of Hungary Alucard (Hellsing) Romania during World War II Max Payne Serial killer Dracula (Castlevania) Battle of Vaslui Battle of France Bucharest World War II Continuation War Landing at Anzac Cove BloodRayne Murder Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kain (Legacy of Kain) Eastern Question Chu-Han contention Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance European Theatre of World War II Jehovah's Witnesses Mein Kampf Religion Legacy of Kain Human rights in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq Thirty Years' War __tefan cel Mare Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Battle of Stalingrad Mongol Empire Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Operation Barbarossa Christianity History of Romania Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Romanians EastEnders Sin City Theodicy Napoleonic Wars NetHack Yugoslavia Crusade Second Crusade Aurangzeb Gestapo Vampire fiction SS Division Totenkopf Appeasement Gibbet Western betrayal Amnesty International Third Battle of Panipat Bram Stoker's Dracula Kurdish people Orhan I Sheikh Abdullah History of Bosnia and Herzegovina Special Air Service Theory of conduct Persian Empire

how is paper made from wood to begin the process pulpwood logs must be reduced to chip form prior to chipping logs are passed through a debarking drum large open ended cylinder within the drum logs collide with one another and rub together removing the bark the bark falls through slots in the cylinder walls and is collected and burned as fuel in the power boilers the debarked logs are conveyed to a chipper which reduces them to small to inch squares with a inch thickness softwood and hardwood chips are kept separate until the pulp is blended at the paper machine since each has its own physical properties wood is made up of small cellulose fibers bound together by a glue like substance called lignin in the pulping process these fibers are separated by cooking the wood with chemicals to dissolve the lignin to accomplish this the chips are loaded into large vessels called digesters on either a batch or continuous basis digesters are designed on the same principle as a kitchen pressure cooker the chips and chemicals are steamed under pressure for to hours until the mixture is reduced to a wet oatmeal like mass the cooking frees the fibers so they can be suspended in water the pulp is blown from the digesters under pressure to separate the fibers it is then washed to remove the cooking chemicals and dissolved lignin and then bleached to the proper shade of whiteness from there the pulp is passed through refiners these refiners roughen the surface of the individual pulp fibers by loosening the threadlike elements from the fiber wall so they cling together when formed into a sheet added after refining are dyes and other additives to give the finished paper the desired properties water is then added to the pulp in a ratio of parts water to one part fiber this furnish as it is called is then run onto the forming fabric or wire of the paper machine the forming fabric is an endless mesh screen that circulates at the wet end of the paper machine there the fibers become interlaced forming a mat of paper and much of the water is extracted traveling at speeds of more than feet per minute the paper is pressed between water absorbing fabrics and wound through a series of steam heated cylinders called dryers where the last of the water in the sheet is removed at this point the paper passes through a size press that applies a starch solution to both sides of the sheet sizing seals the surface so ink cannot soak into the paper during printing since sizing wets the paper the paper must again be dried by traveling through another series of steam heated drums after drying the paper goes through a calendering process that provides a smooth finish by ironing the sheet between heavy polished rollers at the dry end the paper is wound onto spools to form a machine reel and then rewound and slit into smaller rolls on a winder some of these rolls are sent for sheeting and packing into cartons others are rewound to smaller sized rolls and wrapped for shipment a screen is used to separate larger chips  Upholstery Wire Fiberglass Jute Pottery Explosive material Mattress Soap Fossil fuel power plant Solar cell Fuel injection Sulfuric acid Movie projector Cookware and bakeware Coffee Fire extinguisher Screw Pebble bed reactor Seismic retrofit Dry cleaning Solar power Lignin Glass Printmaking Model aircraft Steel Printed circuit board Tofu Spark plug Welding Washing machine Carbon nanotube Carbon Leather Aluminium Dishwasher Two-stroke cycle Hemp Dairy Carburetor Alcohol fuel Coir Carbon dioxide Flax Hamster Water purification Drawing Instant coffee Powder metallurgy Radio controlled airplane Sugar beet Campfire Glossary of firefighting equipment Gilding Internal combustion engine Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Knife Bookbinding Glacier Cocaine Torpedo Architecture of the California missions RISC Jet engine Sailing Electric motor Paint Turbocharger Motor oil Woodworking Energy development Stairway Water (molecule) Weaving Hydrogen Titanium Straw-bale construction Transformer Textile Tattoo Hydrogen economy Gas metal arc welding

tell me a bout hitler in words hitler the rise of evil the saga of the rise of hitler is that of a frenzied and preposterous ambition that plunged the entire world in brutal war for almost a decade only an army corporal in world war i hitler rose through the ranks and his thirst for power was only quenched after he ascended to the post of chancellor of germany years later his rambling and immensely emotional autobiography mein kampf reveals everything about his noticeably unstable early life hitler was born adolf g hitler in austria his father wanted him to study for a government job but the thought of slogging in an office made hitler sick he yearned to be an artist and practiced water colour painting but he achieved little later on he approached the vienna art academy but he was rejected and labeled untalented failure dogged him all these humbling experiences flamed his discontent for his patchwork country austria he looked across the border to magnificent germany flourishing with an unending flow of wealth and blooming with unhindered development hitler's hatred of poverty his rabid and radical devotion to his german heritage and his bigoted loathing of jews combined to form the seeds of his later successful political doctrine hitler left wretched vienna for munich a true german town there he drifted from job to job as carpenter architect's draftsman and watercolorist always he ranted about his political ideas during world war i he gave up his austrian citizenship and enlisted himself in the german army he was a remarkably brave soldier and his unflinching gallantry won him the iron cross unfortunately for him germany was defeated and he landed up in an infirmary temporarily blinded my mustard gas having renounced his austrian citizenship and yet to become a german citizen hitler was now a man without a country in the aftermath of the war munich was caught in a political tirade officers like hitler were used as political spies this marked the turning point of hitler s life on one such cold night of spying hitler guided by intuition ended up as the seventh member of a meeting around a broken gas lamp it consisted of a motley group of army officers painters artisans and crafts men who nursed one ambition ruling germany hitler soon took control of this faction this diverse group went on to become the distinguished nazi party with hitler as its leader the party began to garner supporters hitler s voice torn and hoarsened by mustard gas was hypnotic his audience just remained spell bound he indeed was an effective speaker sneering at the liberal generalities of the various bourgeois parties and hating the communists hitler shouted accusations against the jews and cried out to the germans to form an all powerful national state the flamboyant spirit of the growing nazi party now began to attract the varied restless men who were to become its core the party grew in strength in terms of followers it grew so politically powerful that it started thinking of overthrowing the government well this is precisely what hitler did he with the backing of the brutal nazis attacked a government meeting in a beer hall and tried to seize the reins of governance but he miserably failed accused of high treason and found guilty hitler was thrown in prison due to the immense public uproar his term of sentence was reduced to eight months it was during his time at prison that he wrote the epic mein kampf with the help of the loyal rudolf hess hitler emerged from prison to the roaring applause of the people it was blatantly apparent that he undeniably was a demi god for them after serving his term in captivity he remarked that it would take years for him to rekindle the flame of passion in the hearts of the people what he said was true at the time of his release germany was prospering and revolutions don t flourish in prosperity in a world wide depression hit germany poverty grief and hardship was staring the germans the nazis underwent regeneration they were back stronger than ever this time with the persistent support of the communalists and army personnel the blatant supremacy of the nazis was inevitable hitler was appointed the chancellor of germany and from then onwards he started striving towards his goal of global conquest his quest for power ultimately ended when he rose to become the dictator of germany chief instigator of world war ii hitler was also the master mind behind the mass genocide of jews called holocaust as all of us know germany was finally defeated in ww ii and hitler committed suicide ending a sort of legend in a very desolate fashion among germans during his time hitler was considered as a super man nazi propaganda had made of hitler a symbol of strength and national virtue his indecisions were cloaked as intuition despite his hours and even days of brooding inertia he was pictured as a man of intense action he became idolized by young germans covering his unsavory and cruel character propaganda built a legend of his ascetic habits and selfless devotion to germany after all that i have written above i can indubitably state that hitler through his life and times can be considered as an epitome of sinister malevolence and malicious wickedness though an excellent orator and courageous combatant i feel that hitler could have done much better had he channelized his talents in any other constructive field hitler through his life showed the world that even one man with a strong will can make a world of difference  Participants in

hinduism was a means by which indian rulers could organize society do you agree explain your answer at least give me a website where i can find the answer please its due tomorrow all religions if i may generalize are means to harness the population into an obedient society no wonder marx said the religion was the opium of the masses i must admit i know very little about the hindu religion but here is what i found is it true i have no idea hinduism is unique among the world religions in that it has no founder or date of origin while most major religions derive from new ideas taught by a charismatic leader hinduism is simply the religion of the people of india which has gradually developed over four thousand years the origins and authors of its sacred texts are largely unknown although today's hinduism differs significantly from earlier forms of indian religion hinduism's roots date back as far as bc making it one of the oldest surviving religions because of its great age the early history of hinduism is unclear the most ancient writings have yet to be deciphered so for the earliest periods scholars must rely on educated guesses based on archaeology and the study of contemporary texts in the last few decades the history of india's religion has also become a matter of political controversy the history of any nation or individual is an important part of its self identity and this is especially true of india which so recently gained independence after centuries of colonial rule the controversy over india's history centers on the origin of the aryan culture as we shall see in more detail below http www religionfacts com hinduism history htm hinduism is the western term for the religious beliefs and practices of the vast majority of the people of india one of the oldest living religions in the world hinduism is unique among the world religions in that it had no single founder but grew over a period of years in syncretism with the religious and cultural movements of the indian subcontinent hinduism is composed of innumerable sects and has no well defined ecclesiastical organization its two most general features are the caste system and acceptance of the veda as the most sacred scriptures early hinduism hinduism is a synthesis of the religion brought into india by the aryans c b c and indigenous religion the first phase of hinduism was early brahmanism the religion of the priests or brahmans who performed the vedic sacrifice through the power of which proper relation with the gods and the cosmos is established the veda comprises the liturgy and interpretation of the sacrifice and culminates in the upanishads mystical and speculative works that state the doctrine of brahman the absolute reality that is the self of all things and its identity with the individual soul or atman later upanishads refer to the practices of yoga and contain theistic elements that are fully developed in the bhagavad gita post vedic hinduism in all its forms accepts the doctrine of karma according to which the individual reaps the results of his good and bad actions through a series of lifetimes also universally accepted is the goal of moksha or mukti liberation from suffering and from the compulsion to rebirth which is attainable through elimination of passions and through knowledge of reality and finally union with god http www lotussculpture com bronze sculpture hinduism htm hinduism has a long and complex history it is a blend of ancient legends beliefs and customs which has adapted blended with and spawned numerous creeds and practices please note the 'traditional' view of hindu history as described in this section has been challenged by modern scholars in particular various scholars have advanced the following theories hindu religion pre dated bce 'aryan' a sanskrit word meaning 'noble' does not refer to an invading race at all the aryans did not invade but migrated gradually the aryans were native to the area or found there long before the alleged invasion hinduism originated solely in india there is ongoing controversy over which version of hindu history is the correct one http www bbc co uk religion religions hinduism history history shtml as you can see the the history of hinduism there is nothing to supoort your views but neither is there anything to contradict it

how did helen keller learn to communicate probably the question you're asking is how did helen keller learn to communicate in a socially acceptable way she communicated just fine prior to being able to sign unfortunately it was not socially acceptable her family hired a teacher annie sullivan to help control her annie would sign words into her hand when they would encounter various objects for instance she would put helen's hand on grass and sign the letters for grass you should read helen keller's own description of what it was like when she initially came to the understanding that the signed letters w a t e r meant the wet stuff flowing on her hand helen keller was one of the most articulate writers of the th century she can describe it way better than i can we walked down the path to the well house attracted by the fragrance of the honeysuckle with which it was covered some one was drawing water and my teacher placed my hand under the spout as the cool stream gushed over one hand she spelled into the other the word water first slowly then rapidly i stood still my whole attention fixed upon the motions of her fingers suddenly i felt a misty consciousness as of something forgotten a thrill of returning thought and somehow the mystery of language was revealed to me i knew then that w a t e r meant the wonderful cool something that was flowing over my hand that living word awakened my soul gave it light hope joy set it free there were barriers still it is true but barriers that could in time be swept away i left the well house eager to learn everything had a name and each name gave birth to a new thought as we returned to the house every object which i touched seemed to quiver with life that was because i saw everything with the strange new sight that had come to me now you can understand why she is considered such a remarkable person  Socrates Helen Keller Milton H.

were there such things as these in the dark ages i hear alot about it in simple games involving the dark ages like thiefs warriors archers mages pff yea right but i did hear some great storys of real time thiefs back in thous areas of time were there such thing and just as exciting games about thieves or are they just game made charatures and made up storys warriors archers and theives certainly were around duing the dark ages and you could argue that mages were too in the form of alchemists and practitioners of old pagen religions and or witchcraft but the presentation of these types of characters you'll find in games are highly romanticised versions of the real people they're loosely based on things people actually did sort of during that time period but only very loosely and really if you get into the history far enough what people were actually doing is just as intersting as the characters in the games  Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Ragnarok Online MapleStory Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy character classes Final Fantasy X-2 Final Fantasy Fable (video game) Conan the Barbarian Baldur's Gate series MegaMan Battle Network Magus Final Fantasy (video game) Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones Races of Final Fantasy 8-Bit Theater Warcraft II Final Fantasy Tactics Final Fantasy III RuneScape DragonQuest Wizard White Mage Quest for Glory Necromancy Mercedes Lackey Ryo Bakura Final Fantasy X First-person shooter Thief (computer game) MUD Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Character class Mage: The Ascension Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves Genesis LPMud Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Final Fantasy magic Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles The Hobbit Witch-hunt Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Rave Master Legacy of Kain Differences between editions of Dungeons & Dragons Kingdom Hearts II Pools of Darkness Ragnarok The Animation Christian views on witchcraft The Dark Eye RuneScape locations Drizzt Do'Urden Witchcraft Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Thief (character class) Tamriel Mage Knight Jonathan Archer Yu-Gi-Oh!

ancient miracles what about now in central and south america the pipil aztec mayan and incan nations now mestizo hispanics built gorgeous empires that still are inhabitable today in africa black built the egyptian empire kush empire mali empire songhai empire zulu empire etc too many lol that are wonders to this day europeans built the greek empire roman empire celtic empires etc that in many ways some good and some bad have changed the world in every way middle easterns built the babylonian empire the persian empire jerusalem empire the taj mahal etc that were phenominal and gorgeous asians had culturally rich dynasties and artifacts buildingsand religious and art forms still practiced to this day why arent there any art forms or societies as great appealing or worthy as the historical monuments empires of our ancestors where has our appreciation for livity pride and art gone its like money and racism killed any chance of appreciation of life and beauty clarification back then ppl built their empires made art and practiced traditions with pride and dignity they put effort into their work that attracted ppl to them now because of the need to feel superior you have ppl arguing who started which empire which empire was the best ppl bashing other cultures when all of those listed above at one time embraced and traded intermarried etc with one another and taught and apprecated one another i dont see that happening again the first two ansers prove my point exactly edjdonnell excellent point but while there were constant battles over who was superior back then now its at a all time high there was a time when the ancient cultures did get along which is the reason we have so many different races and ethnic groups due to mixing and education it is a fact that life back then was much more appreciated to be a priest and scam those who follow you meant death in those day theft was taboo and art was a way of life somewhere down the line that all changed and you've meantioned some events but ppl in todays world with moral value and appreciation for life and openmindedness are the minority now there were sick leaders like napoleon yes but now its like because of money ppl are much more devious lol to the dumb fu k who said i hate america learn how to read okay where in this have i said anything about america i said ppl world wide have lost their sense of humanity dont fuc kin get mad because it just so happened that i described your punk b itch ass this is sad i make a valid point and post a reasonable question and all i got was a bunch of cry baby punk sissies wtf empires never appreciated each other at no time in history did a conquering nation allow the things stay as they where they disfigured the pyrimids the roman and greek building and middle eastern palaces japan and china took turns decimating other nations and empires relics as well and in south america it was a free for all in slaughtering one another and taking ove the use of the others buildings for there differnt religions and purposes much like the pyrimids no one is sure what they where first a tomb or a astronomy center for figuring out the weather and calanders of the time napoleon had target practise on the spinx that is why the nose is gone england ran off with all kinds of mummies and relics from the world ove from fallen empires the romans transformed the outer look to fit there designs os there really is no difference from today yes they made elegent and amazing buildings but they did not have technolgy like today so they built to last and most had a religious puropose or to brag on a rulers power and strength the toys have changed but the games are the same  Jew Black (people) Ancient history Mythology Patriotism Nationalism Cultural and

what was the speech that said if the north won the civil war tere would be no more slavery this has been bothering me it is not homework i think you're referring to the emancipation proclamation lincoln gave a speech in which he declared that there was no more slavery in the united states of america it was given before the end of the war and even prior to the outcome of the war had been determined it has been said that lincoln making this speech which was then widely disseminated throughout the south both in print and primarily by word of mouth encouraged the slaves of the time to throw in their lot with the north and even attempt escape to join up with the gar lincoln gave great credit as was their due to former slaves who risked life and limb not to mention being captured and sent back to hell to join the union army and fight against their former owners and the owner's supporters i am unaware of any provision that this freedom would only occur if the union won the war he did it before war's end primarily for political and militarily strategic purposes  American Civil War History of slavery in the United States Confederate States of America Slavery Abraham Lincoln Union blockade Dred Scott v.

the great depression in the dirty 's why could a farmer not successfully farm in there were a lot of factors involved if you're referring to the 'dust bowl' with the dirty s comment then that was because of a massive drought which blew away most of the topsoil but during the great depression banks had to call in all mortgages in order to survive a lot of banks went under because of non loan payments tenant farmers who could not pay their mortgages lost the farm it wasn't that banks were malicious or anything it was simple economics and business which tenant farmers and anyone else who takes out a mortgage understands before they sign the contract who was to blame for the great depression historians are still arguing that point a combination of sub prime loans coupled with too many 'shorts' on the stock market  Great Depression Mortgage History of the United States (1918-1945) New Deal Derivative (finance) Deflation (economics) Dust Bowl Islamic banking Bond Subsidy Bank Gold standard Toronto-Dominion Bank Security (finance) Concurrent estate Economy of Russia Personal finance Economy of Africa Economy of the United States Federal Reserve Leasing Insurance Money Supply-side economics Interest Keynesian economics Citigroup Primerica Financial Services Monetary policy Capital accumulation Wells Fargo History of the United States (1865-1918) Neville Chamberlain James J.

enlightenment vs northern renaissance what are some differences between the cultural values of the enlightenment and the cultural values of the northern renaissance th century i know this seems like hw but it really isnt an assignment its just that my teacher keeps mentioning that there were many cultural differences and i have a feeling she is hinting that it might be on our next test or something n e help will be greatly appreciated any useless answers such as read the book or do your own home work will be flaged thanks research it jk well not really kidding but i do give you real answer too after all you will be reading all of the answers and doing some work my real answer first off the northern renaissance was all about religion and art the enlightenment was all about politics and literature i'll expand on this a little later secondly the northern renaissance was centered in germany while paris was home to the enlightenment the northern renaissance was still in the middle not dark ages this meant that scholarly work was done in latin and modeled on the classics of greek and rome the enlightenment was the s which meant that thinkers wrote in the vernacular and developed their own models this difference also reflects a different target audience for their thoughts the nr was for the scholars and the e's target audience was everyone the nr was funded by patrons of the arts nobility and the e was funded by the people now getting back to the first thing i mentioned during the nr everyone was catholic or being tortured to death as a heretic the nr reformers did not overstep the lines and were able to enjoy government support for the whole nr in retrospect after martin luther the church would start condemning the nr but at the time it was fine with the proposals the lead thinker of the nr was desidarius erasmus a religious scholar who wrote about religion the main artist was durrer a religious artist who did etchings about religion praying hands is his most famous work and is a drawing but most of his works were etchings the e was intellectually led by voltaire an agnostic type phylosophe who wrote political outcry that was started as an outcry against torture other names worth mentioning a diderot who compiled the encyclopedia so that common people could easily access and research a large variety of knowledge and rousseau whose name is misspelled here who wrote novels like emile about education and relationships his books were pretty much the chick flicks of the day the enlightenment did not really enjoy all that much approval by many governments although a few enlightened despots like catherine the great in russia were enthusiastic about it however the french crown wanted to make paris the cultural capital of the world and therefore pretty much turned a blind eye to the e but occasionally exiled a few of its leaders an interesting tidbit that doesn't go along that well with the question is that both eras produced some works that were completely intolerable to the governments so during the nr scholars used the one main illegal circulation of literature to be able to send out heretical ideas they wrote pornos and inserted their philosophies and research into them during the enlightenment people just went to a neighboring country published anonymously there and smuggled their work back into their original country finally the enlightenment produced a culture of its own that was based on the ideas of individual freedoms universal writes and love of education a comparative culture doesn't really exist for the nr hope this helps  Liberalism Dark Ages Jean-Jacques Rousseau Republicanism Protestant Reformation History of the English Bible Judaism Republic Religion Religious pluralism Biblical canon History of literature Christianity Philipp Melanchthon Bible Rudolf Steiner Sociocultural evolution Meaning of life Humanism Rhetoric History of science Education Academia Erasmus Thomas More Taoism History of Europe Late Middle Ages Anti-intellectualism Philosophy Gnosticism Protestantism Catherine II of Russia Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Karl Marx Confucianism Jews in the Middle Ages Postmodernism Orientalism Vulgate Open access Intelligent design movement Separation of church and state Ludwig Wittgenstein Christian apologetics Atheism Culture of Lithuania Michel Foucault History of philosophy Rudolf Hermann Lotze A Course In Miracles Novel Apocrypha Contributions to liberal theory English literature Encyclopedia Feminism Predestination Martin Luther French literature of the 17th century Creationism John Wycliffe Plato Deconstruction Antonio Gramsci Middle Ages Byzantine Empire C.

what specific persecution did the pilgrim fathers experience in britain leading them to leaving for america i'm british and don't know this part of history except for hollywood epic films etc judging from the other responses this won't be a very well recieved answer but it is my understanding that it had more to do with persecution of protestinism than the desire to force beliefs on others british religious leaders went to quite a bit of trouble to break away from the catholic body but retained many elements that hard core protestants found distasteful catholic sentiment was vigorously opposed and the only other choice was church of england which was basically catholic in flavor that did not answer to the pope for those who went further and were at odds with the doctrine and policy of the church of england things did not go well especially during the conflict opposing catholicism anything that was not seen to be explicitly c of e church of england was apostate from the summer and winter festivals of rural welsh folks to the protestant leanings of people in saxony and brittany which was tied to the more or less protestant heresies on the coast of france all of this is very closely connected to the witchcraft hysteria which was pervasive in britain and western france at the time the early c of e led by woolsey's followers was desperate to assert itself as the 'true' belief thus protestants and catholics and witches were lumped together leading to fullout massacres in the welsh forests french villages and abroad in this atmosphere puritans quakers and other offshoots of luther's teachings were seen as threats to the establishment of a unified church in england and more importantly as not recognizing the divine prerogative of the king of england this led to persecution in both private and state forms a protestant puritan may be ostacized by his local society and if a craftsman or merchant this could be a pretty serious dent in his ability to provide for his family his marriage if conducted by a non c of e clergyman may not be recognized by the state leading to problems with inheritance and property rights and a lower status for his children if he did not tithe to the local parsonage or bishopric he may have goods confiscated at an inflated rate but more importantly by not supporting the church that supported the king and his rights he was likely to be branded a traitor and depending on his level of activity with the puritan or otherwise protestant community he could be pillored flogged imprisoned or executed  Separation of church and state Puritan Christianity History of the British constitution Baptist British monarchy Colonial America Divine grace Roman Catholic Church Christian denomination History of Christianity Oliver Cromwell United States religious history Great Apostasy Protestantism Bishop James II of England English Civil War Religious Society of Friends Henry VIII of England Anglicanism Catholic Church in Great Britain James I of England Pacifism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Huldrych Zwingli Mary I of England Salem witch trials Liberalism Christianity and anti-Semitism Elizabeth I of England Quaker history Religious pluralism Homosexuality and Christianity Status of religious freedom in Iran John Wycliffe Parliament of the United Kingdom Calvinism Anne of Great Britain Lutheranism Mormonism and Christianity French Revolution John Wesley Christian anarchism Same-sex marriage in Canada House of Bourbon Lollardy Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford Historical persecution by Christians Witch trial Catechism Habsburg Spain Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Wars of the Three Kingdoms Opposition to cults and new religious movements Biblical canon Roger Williams (theologian) War of the Spanish Succession High church Christian-Jewish reconciliation Fundamentalism George Fox Philip II of Spain Catholicism Conservatism Unitarian Universalism Idolatry History of Europe Edward VI of England Evangelicalism Church of Christ Roman Catholicism's links with political authorities Louis XIV of France Unitarianism Witch-hunt Status of religious freedom in France Same-sex marriage Peasants' War Mary, the mother of Jesus Revivalism History of Scotland Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief A Course In Miracles Religion Clergy History of Ireland Thomas Paine Anti-Mormonism Separation of church and state in the United States Persecution of Christians Ten Commandments Celtic Christianity

what are your thoughts on world war ii this is just a random thought that popped into my mind i would love to hear your thoughts i would like to thank all of you for taking time to answer my question most of them were quite an interesting read jim p is right except for giving france credit if anything they helped start it i think about it alot because my dad almost didn't survive and if he hadn't i wouldn't be here because he didn't marry until he came home my fil was in the worse battles and this is just the ones we know of if he hadn't survived my husband wouldn't have been here or any of his siblings even if my hubby had been alive my son and i would've both been dead because he recognized the smell of sulphur and got us out of the house safely so i often think not only of them but of all the children never born and those forced to live w o a father in a time when you were considered worthless w o both when mothers struggled in dead end jobs often two to still have to raise their kids in poverty i think of all the victims the ones they loved gone or those who lived with the scars all the children never born whole families wiped out with no one left to mourn their passing then i think of the men so brutal and cold that i hope are roasting in the deepest pits of hell they weren't crazy they were sociopaths incapable of feeling beyond appearances then i think of those in germany that allowed a man like this to be elected and france and later the league of nations who kept trying to appease them pretty much like the u n does today that let hitler gain the power he needed to do the damage he did but most of all i'm thankful that there were good men both civilian and soldier who saw the wrong and stood up to it often at the risk of their own lives men with the strength of character that couldn't sit back and do nothing alot of stuff happened on both sides that were wrong but sometimes i think the moral high ground has more to do with lives saved than the action taken itself war is hell but if you set a high standard for yourself while the enemy has a anything goes attitude then how can you win kamakazee fighters were like today's suicide bombers but the difference was their targets were other fighters not innocent civilians that's what makes the difference between an honorable soldier or militant if you wish and a terrorist in any war there is collateral damage that often can't be helped but to target innocents is cowardly and deserves no respect or rewards well guess i'll get off my soapbox but you did ask lol  Theory of conduct Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Zhao Yun Sin City Diablo II Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Suicide bombing Cindy Sheehan Kurt Cobain Polish September Campaign Knots Landing Assassination Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Scenes from a Memory Rais massacre Daredevil Operation Market Garden Theodicy Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Time Out of Mind Hillary Rodham Clinton Simone Weil Total war Strategic bombing Evil Yusuf al-Qaradawi Blood (computer game) Second Battle of the Atlantic Abortion debate Pitaten Serial killer Kodocha Continuation War Incarnations of Immortality Justification (theology) Married... with Children Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Alignment (role-playing games) Night (book) Ten Commandments StarCraft: Uprising Poker jargon Days of our Lives Joke Wolfrider Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Piccolo Junior Saga Yoko Ono A Course In Miracles Noam Chomsky Battle of the Bulge Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Sons of Korhal Yasser Arafat Luftwaffe Jean Grey War New York Giants Bombing of Dresden in World War II Winter War One Tree Hill (TV series) Appeasement Samurai Deeper Kyo Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Good Times Jon Secada EastEnders Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Akuma (Street Fighter) 2004 Republican National Convention RAF Bomber Command Professor X John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Major League Baseball television contracts Neighbours Friends Boston Public Kain (Legacy of Kain) Warsaw Uprising Capital punishment Luminoth The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Contender (television series) Guilty Gear Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope South Park Son Goku (Dragon Ball)

what kind of stone did the romans use for building is desert areas i'm building a model of a romanesque city in a desert climate i would like to know what kind of stone the romans used for building in these areas so that i can decide what color to paint the stonework on the buildings i know they used marble in the european areas but i'm not sure if this kind of stone would have been so prevalent in the middle east and in north africa any help would be greatly appreciated in truth ancient man and modern man both used granite and marble to make buildings if you need example of desert granite then look ti the great pyramids for examples of stone in 'desert' region and for non load bearing walls sandstne is easilly carved sculpted etc that said will resort to cut paste http www quarryscapes no ancient sign php ancient quarries are the forgotten' archaeological sites a pre occupation with monumental archaeological sites particularly in the quarryscapes project region of the eastern mediterranean has consequently overlooked the significance of quarries for example as providing fresh insights into the lives of the non elite in antiquity although ancient quarries are under acute threat from modern development many still remain relatively pristine and most crucially comprise sometimes rare evidence of settlements roads and harbours these are the ghost towns' of antiquity often spanning a time depth over several thousand millennia from the late palaeolithic to the roman period the archaeological record in ancient quarries can inform about technological transformations in stone extraction techniques the logistics of transport sometimes over thousands of kilometres and the social organisation of such activities within the totality of a quarry landscape these landscapes can represent lived' experiences or the embeddedness of significance relating to ancestry kinship and practices within the landscape such as quarrying played out over centuries such places have important implications which have not previously been integrated into arguments about stone symbolism source and use moreover they can help in understanding the political and ideological backdrop associated with stone procurement and what drove it to such heights in antiquity giant columns left behind in a roman granite quarry the mons claudianus in the eastern desert of egypt photo by tom heldal unspectacular but of great significance are palaeolithic quarries and workshops for production of grinding stone egypt photo by tom heldal http www quarryscapes no qlm february php this month we continue our presentation of ancient granite quarries in western turkey known to the roman as marmor troadense this granitoid rock is found in the troas on the slopes of mount igri province of ezine it was already in use as a building material during the archaic hellenistic period in the city of neandria situated on that mountain and its use continued into the hellenistic roman age in nearby alexandria troas now dalyan from there marmor troadense spread all over the mediterranean with particularly broad expansion from the second century a d on the lithotype that best represents the quarry of yedi taslar is a rock of grey violet colour and an medium grain size the structural characteristic most evident to the naked eye is the presence of feldspar of a violet hue and of considerable dimension up to cm in length which gives the stone the appearance of having eyes a textural peculiarity results from the not uncommon black schlieren distributed in random throughout the rock less frequent are yellowish aplitic veins the modal analysis clearly indicated that this is a rock type which fits into the quartz monzonite group its structure is granular porphyritic feldspar and plagioclase are the most plentiful minerals accounting in equal amounts quatz fills the interstices of the coloured components green hornblende slightly prevails over biotite in total common accessory minerals are iron oxides and sulphides titanite apatite and rare epidote wish i could see the results of your endeavor pax ps expect a roman to make a building stand out against the monotony

did the colonies join together to create a single society during the outbreak of the french and indian war i am curious and confused about this question the colonies retained their separate identities but the war did give them a greater sense for the need for cooperation an 'american' society was in development throughout the s despite difference the colonies shared common concerns needs dreams the dynamics were most fascinating because of new england and virginia two regions which would push the revolution forward new england with its industriousness produced children as well as crops etc and having raped pillaged and seized the current states of massachusetts conneticut rhode island from the natives were looking across the allegheny mountains at the lush ohio river valley indulgent virginia had the same motivation to push over their borders seeking cheap plentiful land in ohio agains at the expense of the indians natives and the territorial dreams of france united in the purpose virginia and new englnd forged an uneasy bond a bond strengthend by the port cities colonies of pennsylvania philladelphia and new york who realized they could profit by selling their produces as well as increased shipping needing their facilities so it can be said that the french indian war helped to strengthen the idea of an american identity superseding the individual identities of the colonies however the colonies did reject a call to actually unite as one especially since the proposal suggested cooperating with the natives and not killing all of them or driving them west pax  Ohio Country American Revolution Colonial America Lost counties, cities, and towns of Virginia Midwestern United States Northeastern United States American Revolutionary War Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Frontier Appalachian Mountains History of the United States (1789-1849) Pontiac's Rebellion Connecticut Virginian Railway History of Virginia Ohio British colonization of the Americas U.S. state History of Connecticut Economic history of Canada History of the United States (1776-1789) Atlantic slave trade Berkeley County, West Virginia William N.

what are the basic beliefs of confucianism i dont want to know what it is and who developed it i just want to know about the beliefs although confucianism is often followed in a religious manner by the chinese arguments continue over whether it is a religion confucianism lacks an afterlife its texts express complex and ambivalent views concerning deities and it is relatively unconcerned with some spiritual matters often considered essential to religious thought such as the nature of the soul confucius' principles gained wide acceptance primarily because of their basis in common chinese tradition and belief he championed strong familial loyalty ancestor worship respect of elders by their children and according to later interpreters of husbands by their wives and the family as a basis for an ideal government he expressed the well known principle do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself similar to the golden rule he also looked nostalgically upon earlier days and urged the chinese particularly those with political power to model themselves on earlier examples the superior man seeks for it in himself the petty man seeks for it in others because no texts survive that are demonstrably authored by confucius and the ideas associated with him most closely were elaborated in writings that accrued over the period between his death and the foundation of the first chinese empire in bce many scholars are very cautious about attributing specific assertions to confucius himself edit ethics the confucian theory of ethics is based on three important concepts at the time of confucius l referred to the three aspects of life ceremonies associated with sacrifice to ancestors and deities of various types social and political institutions and the etiquette of daily behavior it was believed by some that l originated from the heavens confucius's view was more nuanced his approach stressed the development of l through the actions of sage leaders in human history with less emphasis on its connection with heaven his discussions of l seem to redefine the term to refer to all actions committed by a person to build the ideal society rather than those simply conforming with canonical standards of ceremony in the early confucian tradition l though still linked to traditional forms of action came to point towards the balance between maintaining these norms so as to perpetuate an ethical social fabric and violating them in order to accomplish ethical good these concepts are about doing the proper thing at the proper time and are connected to the belief that training in the l that past sages have devised cultivates in people virtues that include ethical judgment about when l must be adapted in light of situational contexts in early confucianism y and l are closely linked terms y can be translated as righteousness though it may simply mean what is ethically best to do in a certain context the term contrasts with action done out of self interest while pursuing one's own self interest is not necessarily bad one would be a better more righteous person if one based one's life upon following a path designed to enhance the greater good an outcome of y this is doing the right thing for the right reason y is based upon reciprocity just as action according to l should be adapted to conform to the aspiration of adhering to y so y is linked to the core value of r n r n is the virtue of perfectly fulfilling one's responsibilities toward others most often translated as benevolence or humaneness translator arthur waley calls it goodness with a capital g and other translations that have been put forth include authoritativeness and selflessness confucius's moral system was based upon empathy and understanding others rather than divinely ordained rules to develop one's spontaneous responses of r n so that these could guide action intuitively was even better than living by the rules of y to cultivate one's attentiveness to r n one used another confucian version of the golden rule one must always treat others just as one would want others to treat oneself virtue in this confucian view is based upon harmony with other people produced through this type of ethical practice by a growing identification of the interests of self and other in this regard confucius articulated an early version of the golden rule what one does not wish for oneself one ought not to do to anyone else what one recognises as desirable for oneself one ought to be willing to grant to others confucius and confucianism richard wilhelm edit politics confucius' political thought is based upon his ethical thought he argues that the best government is one that rules through rites l and people's natural morality rather than by using bribery and coercion he explained that this is one of the most important analects if the people be led by laws and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments they will try to avoid the punishment but have no sense of shame if they be led by virtue and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety they will have the sense of shame and moreover will become good translated by james legge the great learning this sense of shame is an internalization of duty where the punishment precedes the evil action instead of following it in the form of laws as in legalism while he supported the idea of government by an all powerful sage ruling as an emperor probably because of the chaotic state of china at his time his ideas contained a number of elements to limit the power of rulers he argued for according language with truth thus honesty was of paramount importance even in facial expression truth must always be represented in discussing the relationship between a subject and his king or a son and his father he underlined the need to give due respect to superiors this demanded that the inferior must give advice to his superior if the superior was considered to be taking the wrong course of action this was built upon a century after confucius's death by his latter day disciple mencius who argued that if the king was not acting like a king he would lose the mandate of heaven and be overthrown therefore tyrannicide is justified because a tyrant is more a thief than a king other confucian texts though celebrating absolute rule by ethical sages recognize the failings of real rulers in maxims such as an oppresive government is more feared than a tiger some well know confucian quotes when you have faults do not fear to abandon them what you do not wish for yourself do not do to others with coarse rice to eat with water to drink and my crooked arm for a pillow is not joy to be found therein riches and honors acquired through unrighteousness are to me as the floating clouds cited from www wikipedia org it is also interesting to know that during his life confucian was banned and outlawed by the first emperor of china who is accredited for forming and creating china into one nation from independent minor dynasties

what other stories are there that fall in the category of the illiad and the odessey i've read both and i've seen troy which is one of my favorite movies but like i havnt really heard nay more stories about that time or that war or anything what has hollywood missed wikipedia says the events of the trojan war are found in many works of greek literature and depicted in numerous works of greek art there is no single authoritative text which tells the entire events of the war instead the story is assembled from a variety of sources some of which report contradictory versions of the events the most important literary sources are the two epic poems traditionally credited to homer the iliad and the odyssey composed sometime between the ninth and sixth centuries bc each poem narrates only a part of the war the iliad covers a short period in the last year of the siege of troy while the odyssey concerns odysseus's return to his home island of ithaca following the sack of troy other parts of the trojan war were told in the poems of the epic cycle also known as the cyclic epics the kypria aithiopis little iliad iliou persis nostoi and telegony though these poems survive only in fragments their content is known from a summary included in proclus' chrestomathy the authorship of the cyclic epics is uncertain it is generally thought that the poems were written down in the seventh and sixth century bc after the composition of the homeric poems though it is widely believed that they were based on earlier traditions both the homeric epics and the epic cycle take origin from oral tradition even after the composition of the iliad odyssey and the cyclic epics the myths of the trojan war were passed on orally in many genres of poetry and through non poetic storytelling events and details of the story that are only found in later authors may have been passed on through oral tradition and could be as old as the homeric poems visual art such as vase painting was another medium in which myths of the trojan war circulated in later ages playwrights historians and other intellectuals would create works inspired by the trojan war the three great tragedians of athens aeschylus sophocles and euripides wrote many dramas that portray episodes from the trojan war among roman writers the most important is the st century bc poet virgil in book of the aeneid aeneas narrates the sack of troy this section of the poem is thought to rely on material from the cyclic epic iliou persis  Sanskrit literature Little Iliad Kypria Trojan Horse Troy (film) Telegony Achilles Poetry French Renaissance literature Modern Greek literature Aeneas Byzantine Literature Bible Anglo-Saxon literature Irish mythology Aithiopis Lost work British literature Ancient Greece Ganymede Agamemnon New Testament Loeb Classical Library Aeschylus Novel Lu__s de Cam__es Short story Arabic literature H.D.

did the americans really help out the israel druing the war some had rumored that there were american pilots who flied the israelites' planes etc etc no americans did not fly israeli planes nor did they provide any military assistance israeli planes at the time were not even us manufacture they were french the arabs claimed america was helping israel because it was the only way to save face in light of israel's overwhelming victory israeli intelligence taped a conversation between nasser and king hussein in which nasser asks will we say that the us and britain are attacking or just the united states later in the conversation he says by god i will make an announcement and you will make an announcement that american and british airplanes are taking part against us from aircraft carriers from oren's six days of war p the israelis provided the tape to pres johnson who was furious and referred to the arab claims as the big lie the us did not begin providing military aid to israel until after the war in israeli planes were french their tanks were french british and some us ww surplus rifles were israeli before the outbreak of war the us and other western countries tried to support a diplomatic solution to the crisis which began when nasser moved his troops into the sinai demilitarized since expelled un observers and closed the red sea to israeli shipping the us supported freedom of navigation and there was discussion of western nations challenging nasser's blockade but no one wanted to risk it the us and france promised to support israel's right of navigation as part of the israeli withdrawal from sinai after the suez crisis in ' the west's failure to stick by those promises was disappointing to the israelis to say the least and is one example of why they are reluctant to have others responsible for their defense interestingly soviet pilots did fly for egypt in the war of attrition the israelis shot of them down which ultimately led to a cease fire before the situation resulted in superpower confrontation those who say the us sent weapons may be thinking of the yom kippur war when nixon arranged a massive airlift of weapons to match what the soviets were giving the arabs as far as i know the only time us military personnel have directly engaged in israeli defense was during the gulf war when americans operated the patriot anti missile systems  History of Israel Israel Defense Forces USS Liberty incident Gamal Abdel Nasser Israeli-Palestinian conflict timeline Sinai Peninsula Gulf War Camp David Accords (1978) Al-Aqsa Intifada USS America (CV-66) Timeline of Jewish history History of Modern Egypt Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Saddam Hussein The Crossing Terrorism against Israel 1982 Lebanon War Ariel Sharon Black September in Jordan Military history of the United States Yasser Arafat Royal Air Force World War II Polish September Campaign James R.

hadrian's wall how did he know it was the narrowest part of the country how did hadrian know that ware he built his wall it was the narrowest part of the country wen there wasnt satalites or ariel photographs the romans were pretty good at the old style of triangulation maps have been in existence roughly since elizabethan times as we understand them now and in cruder forms before then and they certainly didn't have sattelites or arial photographs they used triangulation which involves going to a high point and using a mathematical system to make measurements and then plotting these on to paper also the romans had walked pretty much everywhere in the country and built long durable straight roads oftentimes these ran along ancient pre historic tracks so the chances are probably a lot of people or tribes knew that this was the narrowest point in the country no doubt they would be pretty amazed at the technology we use for such things but in reality we should be pretty impressed with theirs it was both logical and innovative and much of the technology and systems we use to run the infrastructure of our countries today was developed on the back of the civilizations like the romans greeks egyptians mayans and various others  Hadrian Geographic information system Surveying Hadrian's Wall Architectural history China Parallax Pottery Maya calendar Ancient Egypt Geometry History of technology Eschatology Time Out of Mind Archimedes Infinity Logic 2000 Australian Grand Prix Ancient history Ordnance Survey Typeface Roman Britain Athletics Bratislava Philosophy Theory of conduct Culture of Lithuania Jerusalem Civilization III Western world Cynic Delaunay triangulation Writing system Egypt Art of Ancient Egypt W.

how was archimides killed reportedly this is a story told by plutarch archimedes the mathematician was so abstracted and absent minded that once he began an equation he couldn't see or hear anything else his servants would haul him to a bathtub and he would scribble notations in the soap bubbles this is the same mathematician who when he learned that his own body mass inserted in the bathtub displaced an equal mass of water ran at once through the streets of the city to announce his discovery stark naked bathwater dripping from his hair howling eureka i have figured it out sure enough when his home city of syracuse was captured by roman forces and the general marcellus gave order that archimedes whose calculations formed the basis for so many engines of war was to be brought to him archimedes was found by a soldier in a house and archimedes was scribbling mathematical equations in the dust on his floor the soldier demanded that archimedes accompany him but the geometry wizard did not hear eventually the soldier became so frustrated that he lost his temper and slew archimedes with his sword before hurrying on to other loot when the general learned of it he was furious i would not have wanted to be that soldier  Archimedes Geometry Mathematics Mathematician Calculus Romulus and Remus Joseph Louis Lagrange Hipparchus (astronomer) Buoyancy Pi Carl Friedrich Gauss Marcus Claudius Marcellus History of physics Force Black hole William Rowan Hamilton Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Gravity Ordinary differential equation Pappus of Alexandria Galileo Galilei Torque Natural number Coriolis effect Ephesian Tale Archimedes Palimpsest Hannibal Ancient Greek literature Taikyoku shogi Cicero Complex number Tai shogi Mathematics of general relativity History of calculus Marcus Licinius Crassus Macbeth Maxwell's equations Adjoint functors Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Boolean algebra Function (mathematics) Shaggy dog story Second Punic War Quaternion Richard Rahl Classical mechanics Blood on the Tracks History of science in early cultures Sphere History of computing Covariance and contravariance Physical science Regular polytope Parabola Finite element method Battle of Thermopylae Mathematical notation Miss Saigon Dirac equation Sicilian Expedition Vector (spatial) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe General relativity Second Bloody Valentine War Laws of Form Dai dai shogi Sento Srebrenica massacre Marius Aerys Targaryen Infinitesimal Derivative Naive set theory Trajectory Group theory Mithraism Heracles Lagrangian point Post-invasion Iraq, 2003___2005 Pah-Peh-Rheo Energy Fancy Crane Link (Legend of Zelda) Stress (physics) Comet Muslim ibn Aqeel Diophantine equation EastEnders Henri Poincar__ Algebraic geometry Floppy disk The Sand Reckoner Polynomial Combinatory logic Shannara Druids Acorn Archimedes Elric of Melnibon__

who occupies a memorable place nice or not nice between hitler hitler the rise of evil the saga of the rise of hitler is that of a frenzied and preposterous ambition that plunged the entire world in brutal war for almost a decade only an army corporal in world war i hitler rose through the ranks and his thirst for power was only quenched after he ascended to the post of chancellor of germany years later his rambling and immensely emotional autobiography mein kampf reveals everything about his noticeably unstable early life hitler was born adolf g hitler in austria his father wanted him to study for a government job but the thought of slogging in an office made hitler sick he yearned to be an artist and practiced water colour painting but he achieved little later on he approached the vienna art academy but he was rejected and labeled untalented failure dogged him all these humbling experiences flamed his discontent for his patchwork country austria he looked across the border to magnificent germany flourishing with an unending flow of wealth and blooming with unhindered development hitler's hatred of poverty his rabid and radical devotion to his german heritage and his bigoted loathing of jews combined to form the seeds of his later successful political doctrine hitler left wretched vienna for munich a true german town there he drifted from job to job as carpenter architect's draftsman and watercolorist always he ranted about his political ideas during world war i he gave up his austrian citizenship and enlisted himself in the german army he was a remarkably brave soldier and his unflinching gallantry won him the iron cross unfortunately for him germany was defeated and he landed up in an infirmary temporarily blinded my mustard gas having renounced his austrian citizenship and yet to become a german citizen hitler was now a man without a country in the aftermath of the war munich was caught in a political tirade officers like hitler were used as political spies this marked the turning point of hitler s life on one such cold night of spying hitler guided by intuition ended up as the seventh member of a meeting around a broken gas lamp it consisted of a motley group of army officers painters artisans and crafts men who nursed one ambition ruling germany hitler soon took control of this faction this diverse group went on to become the distinguished nazi party with hitler as its leader the party began to garner supporters hitler s voice torn and hoarsened by mustard gas was hypnotic his audience just remained spell bound he indeed was an effective speaker sneering at the liberal generalities of the various bourgeois parties and hating the communists hitler shouted accusations against the jews and cried out to the germans to form an all powerful national state the flamboyant spirit of the growing nazi party now began to attract the varied restless men who were to become its core the party grew in strength in terms of followers it grew so politically powerful that it started thinking of overthrowing the government well this is precisely what hitler did he with the backing of the brutal nazis attacked a government meeting in a beer hall and tried to seize the reins of governance but he miserably failed accused of high treason and found guilty hitler was thrown in prison due to the immense public uproar his term of sentence was reduced to eight months it was during his time at prison that he wrote the epic mein kampf with the help of the loyal rudolf hess hitler emerged from prison to the roaring applause of the people it was blatantly apparent that he undeniably was a demi god for them after serving his term in captivity he remarked that it would take years for him to rekindle the flame of passion in the hearts of the people what he said was true at the time of his release germany was prospering and revolutions don t flourish in prosperity in a world wide depression hit germany poverty grief and hardship was staring the germans the nazis underwent regeneration they were back stronger than ever this time with the persistent support of the communalists and army personnel the blatant supremacy of the nazis was inevitable hitler was appointed the chancellor of germany and from then onwards he started striving towards his goal of global conquest his quest for power ultimately ended when he rose to become the dictator of germany chief instigator of world war ii hitler was also the master mind behind the mass genocide of jews called holocaust as all of us know germany was finally defeated in ww ii and hitler committed suicide ending a sort of legend in a very desolate fashion among germans during his time hitler was considered as a super man nazi propaganda had made of hitler a symbol of strength and national virtue his indecisions were cloaked as intuition despite his hours and even days of brooding inertia he was pictured as a man of intense action he became idolized by young germans covering his unsavory and cruel character propaganda built a legend of his ascetic habits and selfless devotion to germany after all that i have written above i can indubitably state that hitler through his life and times can be considered as an epitome of sinister malevolence and malicious wickedness though an excellent orator and courageous combatant i feel that hitler could have done much better had he channelized his talents in any other constructive field hitler through his life showed the world that even one man with a strong will can make a world of difference

what is the name of the longest platform in india built in kharagpur historically kharagpur was a part of hijli kingdom historians claim that as early as th century kharagpur used to be a small village surrounded by thick forests the village was on high rocky barren land the only inhabited settlement near kharagpur was hijli hijli was a small island village on the banks of river rasulpur in the delta of bay of bengal it developed into a port town in hijli was also a province and was in existence till it covered parts of bengal and orissa it had important towns like tamluk panskura debra along with kelghai haldi rivers on the north the south and east sides bounded by bay of bengal and kharagpur keshiary dantan and jaleswar on the west hijli was ruled by taj khan who was the disciple of guru peer mackdram sha chisti it was also ruled by kusan gupta and pal dynasties and also by mughals it is said that hijli had excellent business and trade centers with the judiciary jail and administrative offices etc during the reign of hindu kings and continued during moghul raj it was at its peak in ad and the prosperity of hijli province during this period was beyond description the capital of hijli was in bahiri up to a d and got shifted to hijli afterwards in the th century another port town khejuri came into existence primarily set up by the british for carrying out trade with european countries khejuri was also an island set up on the banks of river koukhali in the delta region development of this region because of khejuri and hiji port can be gauged by the fact that the first indian telegraph office was established in connecting khejuri with calcutta in the devastating cyclone of both the ports got destroyed the islands have since got merged with main land captain nicolson was the first english to invade hijli and captured the port but could not do much in job charnock with soldiers sloops and warships captured hijli defeating hindu mughul emperors after the war with mughal emperor a treaty was signed between job charnock and the mughul emperor the loss suffered by job charnock forced him to leave hijli and proceed towards uluberia while mughul emperor continuted to rule the province from there they finally settled at sutanuti in kolkata for establishing their business in eastern india this was the start of east india company in india hijli as we know it today is only a very small part of erstwhile hijli province and was created for establishing administrative offices by british in th century it is strange that almost entire kharagpur division of today has boundaries identical to hijli province it is said that the name of kharagpur derived from the name of old shiva temple called khargeswar located at the outskirts of kharagpur it is also said that the temple was established by king kharag singh pal and was named after him the place of kharagpur has mythological importance too as depicted in mahabharata this area was ruled by the demon king hiramba pancha pandavas spent a part of their repatriation years here bhim had fallen in love with hirimba sister of hiramba this annoyed hiramba who clashed with bhim hiramba was killed by bhim at the same place where khargeswar temple is located kharagpur railway stationthe first railway establishment at kharagpur started with the commissioning of rail link between cuttack balasore kharagpur and from sini to kolaghat via kharagpur kharagpur as a junction station got established in railway map in december the public mood and the reaction of society on introduction of rail transport in this region has been nicely depicted by the famous bengali novelist dr ramapada choudhury who was born and brought up in kharagpur in his bengali novel prothom prohor it is said that the people were initially afraid to travel by train for the fear of accident over the bridge fear of collapsing of bridge fear of getting outcaste since there were no separate seating arrangement for different castes and religions however things got changed on the face of famine during the early th century the railway company came forward and offered jobs to the local unemployed men gave them free ride by train and even offered a blanket for traveling by train this promotional scheme broke the jinx and made rail transport acceptable to the society innovative marketing strategy midnapur the district headquarters got connected up to the bank of kosai river in february construction of bridge over kosai completed in june the rail line from howrah to kolaghat up to the eastern bank and from kharagpur up to western bank of rupnarayan river was completed in however through running of trains between howrah and kharagpur could only be possible in april after the bridge over rupnarayan river got completed howrah amta light railway ft gauge line was completed in and was operated by m s martin co of calcutta this link remained operative till after closure of the light railways demand for a broad gauge line between howrah and amta creeped up the project got completed in four phases in the first phase line between santragachi and domjur was completed in in the nd phase it got extended up to bargachia in extension up to mushirhat mahendralal nagar station was completed in and the final lap up to amta got completed in december the need for rail link between panskura and tamluk was conceived at the beginning of th century almost at the same time when the rail link between howrah and kharagpur was opened railway company received offer for construction from two agencies m s martin company and m s babu nibaran chandra dutta the former against guaranteed return of while the latter without any guarantee although the offer of the latter was lucrative the dilemma of whether to offer the work of construction to a native or not forced the project to be abandoned after independence the requirement of rail link connecting panskura and durgachak came up primarily for the purpose of constructing haldia port the rail link between panskura durgachak via tamluk completed in which was later on extended to haldia in extension of rail link to digha from tamluk was sanctioned in and it took years to complete this project in two phases the first phase of linking tamluk and contai completed in november and the tourist destination digha got connected to howrah shalimar in december geographical location of kharagpur and its rail links with the rest of the country favoured construction of centralized workshop with facilities to carry out major repairs of all broad gauge stock in the work was sanctioned and the construction of the workshop completed in the need for a centralized hospital at khargpur was also felt in late th century and the hospital with complete medical facilities was established in dr arthur martin leake victorian cross winner was appointed as chief medical officer of kharagpur hospital in on th september freedom fighters in hijli jail were rejoicing the killing of sessions judge mr garley who had passed death penalty to famous freedom fighter shri dinesh gupta the jail authorities could not bear with this and killed the freedom fighters in their cell today the infamous hijli jail is located inside the iit campus area now the name of kharagpur is synonymous with iit the railway establishment bears testimony of its iit kharagpur s development in the initial years not to forget that the father of nation mahatma gandhi also served his term in the hijli jail along with khudiram bose one of the eminent freedom fighter of bengal

was russia and her citizens better off under the soviet regime than now just seems to me that while political freedom was not tolerated people at least still had some stability in their lives was capitialism a huge culture shock well i think you should ask russians this because we can only give opinions based upon our frames of reference assuming that i would say that the average russian not high enough or vocal enough to threaten anyone might have been better off in some respects and i agree their lives seemed more stable as proof of this i cite documentaries i have seen where some russians wish to return to the old ways when their futures if austere seemed more secure and russia the ussr anyway was a dominant world power that brought them pride however there were few consumer goods and those there were were usually reserved for party members one might stand in line for hours to buy bread or soap and wait five years for a car if one could afford one and based on the writings of the dissidents the more aware and intelligent one was the more one suffered it always seemed to me that they had traded one serfdom for another and possibly a worse one also i have read that the crime rate in russia has really escalated with fewer restraints and political attention to the problem conversely the younger generation seem to appreciate the increased access to the outer world and the availability of more consumer goods and evince no desire for the old days so who knows there do seem to be an awful lot of russian women seeking to be someones bride anywhere but russia  Bretton Woods system Inflation History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991) Soviet Union Russia Economy of Russia History of Russia History of post-Soviet Russia Free trade Foreign policy of Japan History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union Russian Revolution of 1917 People's Republic of China Democracy Jew Supply and demand German Confederation Capitalism Keynesian economics Tariff Microeconomics Communism Politics of Russia Autism rights movement Finnish Civil War Simone Weil Anti-communism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economy of Europe Russian Orthodox Church Collectivisation in the USSR Belarus Communist state History of the Soviet Union (1927-1953) Winter War History of the German Democratic Republic History of Poland (1945-1989) Liberalism International Monetary Fund Vladimir Lenin History of nuclear weapons Serfdom Cold War (1947-1953) and its origins Freedom of speech History of the Soviet Union History of the United States (1945-1964) World War I Motorcycle Privatization Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia Left-wing politics Annuity East Germany Napoleonic Wars Chernobyl accident Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23 Nuclear warfare Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Economy of Asia Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Brave New World Capital accumulation Overpopulation Publicly funded medicine Eastern Question Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe History of socialism Economy of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev Communist Party of the Soviet Union Plame affair Progressive tax Democratic Party (United States) Central Asia Neoliberalism Gold standard Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Economy of the United States World War II Enlargement of the European Union History of the United States (1918-1945) Russian history, 1892-1920 Independence Party (Iceland) History of Japan World government Kyoto Protocol Monetary policy Cold War (1962-1991) Superpower Islam as a political movement Dmitri Shostakovich History of Poland (1795-1918) Second Chechen War Total war Separation of church and state

could someone provide a description of what marriage was for first century jews and romans the apostle paul wrote of the virtues of marriage but what did the institution look like that he spoke of was it arranged was polygamy common was marriage something average people engaged in if someone can point me towards some scholarly research on this matter i'd love to read it marriage hasn't changed all that much over the course of two thousand years it is a union of two people usually with the goal of furthering the human race sometimes the two partners are genuinely in love most often it is more a matter of convenience arranged marriages were more common among the rich the well born for both jews and romans and neither of them embraced polygamy pauls views on mariage were influenced by his jewish upbringing but whereas jewish traditions encourages fun healthy sexuality paul imparted a freakish view that sex was foul evil an ugly nasty act one had to endure in order to produce children but yes the average person hoped for marriage and most settled into mundane married life here are links and a few words http victorian fortunecity com lion roman romarriage html unlike our contemporary society no specific civil ceremony was required for the creation of a marriage only mutual agreement and the fact that the couple must regard each other as husband and wife accordingly gardner although not a legal necessity some weddings usually the first marriage of elite couples was accompanied by much revelry and song as featured in one of catullus' poems it describes the celebration of the marriage with dancing singing and the brandishing of torches ribald jokes are shouted at the bride and nuts are scattered as she makes her way towards her husband's house the groom arrives before the bride so that he can personally invite her to come and share his home now married what does the couple expect to gain from the experience the young bride is most probably in her early teens as is the girl described in catullus' poem with the words young boy release the little girl's small smooth arm after marriage she will be transformed from a little girl into a respected wife elsewhere catullus assures his readers that young daughters are unloved by their parents until they are married if when she is ripe for marriage she enters into wedlock she is ever dearer to her husband and less hateful to her parents catullus poems http ancienthistory about com od marriage a romanmarriage htm motives for marriage in ancient rome if you planned to run for office you could increase your chances of winning by creating a political alliance through the marriage of your children parents arranged marriages to produce descendants to tend the ancestral spirits the name matrimonium with its root mater mother shows the principle objective of the institution the creation of children marriage could also improve social status and wealth some romans even married for love the legal status of marriage marriage was not a state affair at least until augustus made it his business it was private between husband and wife their families and between parents and their children nonetheless there were legal requirements it wasn't automatic people getting married had to have the right to marry the connubium connubium is defined by ulpian frag v to be uxoris jure ducendae facultas or the faculty by which a man may make a woman his lawful wife matrimonium who had the right to marry generally all roman citizens and some non citizen latins had connubium however there was no connubium between patricians and plebians until the lex canuleia b c the consent of both patres familias was required bride and groom must have reached puberty over time examination to determine puberty gave way to standardization at age for girls and for boys eunuchs who would never reach puberty were not permitted to marry monogamy was the rule so an existing marriage precluded connubium as did certain blood and legal relationships the betrothal dowry and engagement rings engagements and engagement parties were optional but if an engagement were made and then backed out of breach of contract would have had financial consequences the bride's family would give the engagement party and formal betrothal sponsalia between the groom and the bride to be who was now sponsa dowry to be paid after the marriage was decided on the groom might give his fiancee an iron ring anulus pronubis or some money arra how roman matrimonium differed from modern western marriage it's in terms of property ownership that roman marriage sounds most unfamiliar communal property was not part of marriage and the children were their father's if a wife died the husband was entitled to keep one fifth of her dowry for each child but the rest would be returned to her family a wife was treated as a daughter of the pater familias to whom she belonged whether that was her father or the family into which she married distinctions between confarreatio coemptio usus and sine manu who had control of the bride depended on the type of marriage a marriage in manum conferred the bride on the groom's family along with all her property one not in manum meant the bride was still under the control of her pater familias she was required to be faithful to her husband as long as she co habited with him however or face divorce laws regarding dowry were probably created to deal with such marriages a marriage in manum made her the equivalent of a daughter filiae loco in her husband's household there were three types of marriages in manum confarreatio confarreatio was an elaborate religious ceremony with ten witnesses the flamen dialis himself married confarreatio and pontifex maximus in attendance only the children of parents married confarreatio were eligible the grain far was baked into a special wedding cake farreum for the occasion hence the name confarreatio coemptio in coemptio the wife carried a dowry into the marriage but was ceremoniously bought by her husband in front of at least five witnesses she and her possessions belonged to her husband usus after a year's cohabitation the woman came under her husband's manum unless she stayed away for three nights trinoctium abesse since she wasn't living with her pater familias and since she wasn't under the hand of her husband she acquired some freedom sine manu not in manum marriages began in the third century b c and became the most popular by the first century a d there was also a marital arrangement for slaves contuberium and between freedmen and slaves concubinatus http ablemedia com ctcweb consortium ancientweddings html excitusque hilari die nuptialia concinens uoce carmina tinnula pelle humum

what did joseph stalin learn at the seminary i am really in need of an answer to this ecspecially what methods of control did joseph stalin learn so any answers would be great when a young joseph vissarionovich dzhugashvili entered seminary in his native georgia he confessed he was an atheist and that he enrolled because he couldn't afford to attend the university joseph who adopted the name stalin in later years studied the russian language and theology stalin learned the methods of control used by the russian church to keep the devout in tow the church was traditionally authoritarian and made saints into cults of personality the clergy used colorful icons smoke and lights to instill fear and obedience into uneducated peasants stalin would use such shows and intimidation to control his subjects as soviet leader stalin's disregard for human life and cruelty can be traced to his childhood joseph's father severely abused him and then abruptly left the family when he was eight the trauma of his early years certainly helped to mold him into a steel fisted stalin is russian for steel dictator stalin was ruthless as leader of the ussr he turned himself and his deceased comrade vladimir lenin into national icons this new cult of personality would replace the revolution with a fascist like nationalism stalin killed off all party cadres who were close to both him and lenin this ensured no one would be able to expose him for betraying the revolution and threaten his rule stalin the man of steel was portrayed as the soviet superhero stalin used the media often repeated mindless slogans and threats of exile to gulags or death for the smallest crimes he instigated purges compelling party members to betray their friends and family hoping they could avoid becoming victims as well fear and isolation kept the soviet union under control during the second world war stalin did briefly allow church services to raise the national spirits he learned the russian need for authority for their security which they found in those troubled years but following the war until his death in stalin nearly destroyed what was left of the russian orthodox church the benefactor of his education  Soviet Union Great Purge Vladimir Lenin Communism Russian Revolution of 1917 Workers' Party of Korea Animal Farm Leon Trotsky Anti-communism History of Russia Communist state Communist Party USA Eastern Orthodox Church Cultural Revolution Collectivisation in the USSR History of communism Trotskyism NKVD Cheng Feng History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991) Mao Zedong History of socialism Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact History of the Soviet Union (1927-1953) Maxim Gorky Eastern Front (World War II) Stalinism Nikita Khrushchev Fascism Grigory Zinoviev Propaganda George F.

crusades a real question ok this isnt a religious based reason im athesit so yea during school i was taught that the crusades were almost purely political although some might say that it was a purely defensive move i have to ask why then did they not just go against the ottoman turks the ones who were actually raiding their lands also then why did the europeans send a crapload of untrained soldiers begger theives and other unwanted people from the overcrowded cities of europe also from a political and economical standpoint you can clearly see why anyone would want to invade the middle east the middle east is in a gigantic trade route with cities like mecca jerusalem etc you could make a huge profit out of taxes of course political figures such as the pope could have reasoned that jerusalem was the home of christians and rightously belonged to them if i have these facts wrong say so and plz have multiple websites to prove your answer i still might be stubborn d is catholic your are mistaken in that catholics thought that jerusalem belonged to them remember that islam had control of jerusalem and middle eastern trade routes for centuries before the crusades it is not as if jerusalem was taken over and then the pope sent an army to take it back as for why did europe send a crapload of untrained soldiers that is because that is all there was in europe at the time europe especially at the start of the first crusade was a real backwater filled with minor kingdoms fighting each other there were no overcrowded cities of europe outside of italy and the ruined roman towns everything was small villages surrounding a keep or rudimentary castle of the feudal lord those people went because that was what could be sent if you want to talk about politics one of the major impulses of the vatican was to try to get the minor kingdoms to stop fighting each other the vatican was always interested in alliances and building peace in europe part of the crusades really was about uniting europe against a common cause which was the encroachment and harassment of the islamic caliphates on europe control of the trade routes was never a factor for the vatican it was interested in protecting people that went on the trade routes later crusades were attempts to protect the byzantine empire anyway any really good history book says what i said  Crusade Byzantine Empire First Crusade History of Islam History of Europe History of the Middle East Second Crusade Ottoman Empire Middle Ages Jerusalem Manuel I Comnenus History of Germany Kingdom of Jerusalem Late Middle Ages State Reconquista Armenian Quarter History of Ottoman Albania Damascus Bosniaks Mongol Empire Jew Crusade of 1101 Romania in the Middle Ages Jews in the Middle Ages History of early Arab Egypt Christianity High Middle Ages Greeks Franks Nur ad-Din Military history of France Religion in Israel Constantinople Islam Ottoman wars in Europe Cyprus in the Middle Ages Persian Empire Italian Renaissance Suleiman the Magnificent History of the Mediterranean region Medieval: Total War World War I Saladin Fall of Constantinople History of the Balkans Arab-Israeli conflict Skanderbeg Republic History of Slovakia Church of the Holy Sepulchre Jewish history Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor Siege of Belgrade Roman Catholicism's links with political authorities British monarchy Islam as a political movement Kievan Rus' Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Holy Roman Empire Islamic Golden Age Western world 1260s Vlad III Dracula Siege of Acre Serbia Separation of church and state Feudalism History of the Netherlands Principality of Antioch Crimean War Turkic peoples Population transfer History of Lebanon City-state Balkans Persecution of Christians East-West Schism Nationalism Cyprus Israel Christian denomination Eastern Orthodox Church Palestinian Diplomacy Seventh Crusade Maronite History of Christianity Western Roman Empire History of the Roman Catholic Church Icon Bulgaria

first in the americas we all know that it was not columbus who found the americas there is evidance that chinese egyptians vikings had landed far before who was the first then the native americans were there first and it's believed they crossed via the bering sea however there a number of contenders for the next wave of colonists the vikings did land in vinland newfoundland and probably got as far south as new york the chinese appear to have landed on the west coast in the 's more than likely in south central america there are other contenders too the welsh prince madog is supposedly to have traveled in the th century and landed near mobile bay alabama st brendan from ireland is also supposed to have made the same journey at about the same time however i think these are myths used by the english as a means of justifying the legitimacy of their claims to territories i doubt the egyptians managed to succeed however if you were to say the who was the first of the next wave of colonists to land on continental america i'd have to say it was john cabot like columbus he was looking for an alternate route to india columbus also never set foot on continental america he discovered the caribbean islands and theres fierce debate as to where kennewick man whose remains were discovered on the banks of the ohio river fit into the overall scheme of things since he appears to be of an earlier wave of colonisation than native americans the main thing with the success of colonisation is the technology gap the chinese vikings welsh etc had pretty much the same technology as the natives hand to hand weapons and bows so there was no real advantage had militarily however by the arrival of columbus and cabot weapons for them had progressed to firearms giving an increased stand off advantage  Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact Americas Newfoundland Vinland Christopher Columbus Age of Discovery Madoc Indigenous peoples of the Americas Norse colonization of the Americas British colonization of the Americas Atlantic Ocean Viking Age Viking Colonisation History of the Americas England Maritimes European colonization of the Americas British Empire Pre-Confederation history of Canada South America History of Canada French colonisation of the Americas French colonial empires North America Native Americans in the United States James Cook Vinland map Wales Frontier Roanoke Island Indigenous peoples in Brazil Military history of Japan Appalachian Mountains Languages in the United States History of the World Thirteen Colonies Canada History of Quebec Kensington Runestone New France Narrow gauge Midwestern United States History of Scandinavia Barbados Geography of Canada First Transcontinental Railroad Richard Amerike Anglo-Saxons History of Ireland Norman Conquest of England United States Lebor Gab__la __renn Columbus Day St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador USS Augusta (CA-31) Transcontinental nation Francisco Hern__ndez de C__rdoba (discoverer of Yucat__n) Hern__n Cort__s Newfoundland and Labrador Zheng He Early history of Ireland History of the United States International League Battle of Leyte Gulf History of the Southern United States History of the British Army Italian American Hernando de Soto (explorer) Imperialism in Asia Seven Years' War War of 1812 Population history of American indigenous peoples British Isles History of Africa Second Bloody Valentine War Massachusetts Bay Colony Economic history of Canada Historic regions of the United States Brian Boru Ohio History of Western Australia 2004 Atlantic hurricane season History of North America Patagonia Thanksgiving USS Vincennes (1826) Nationalism 1421 hypothesis

why might us policy makers miss their old adversary after the end of the cold war and the demise of the ussr because the grass is always greener on the other side containment and the red menace are romanticized today as a livable solution though when we lived with them we were terrified of the possibility for conflict today there is no definitive enemy except those old chaotic players that stand to disrupt the state like al qaeda who are very difficult to control in a world order where states deal with other states not fluid groups of dubious nature it's simply that we miss the predictability and simple worldview of that era much as i'm sure the brits missed their anti french stance in world affairs following the collapse of the french monarchy and then again following napolean's defeat the world you know is scary enough but you know what to expect based on experience today we're looking back at the scary world we knew and realizing it wasn't so scary and we're seeing the alternative in the glimpses of the world of tomorrow forming today i think most of us would rather have nikita banging his shoe as a gavel at the soviet or boasting that we will crush you rather than osama waving his pious hand applauding the brave fighters for allah who beheaded the captured infidels ahhh we miss gorby and his birthmark  Cold War Nikita Khrushchev Soviet Union Al-Qaeda World War I 2003 Invasion of Iraq Mikhail Gorbachev Nuclear warfare Osama bin Laden Background history of the September 11, 2001 attacks Winter War World War II Iraq War Liberalism Military history of the Soviet Union Red Army Prisoner of war New World Order (political) Chu-Han contention History of Afghanistan History of Russia Anti-communism Anti-aircraft warfare Polish September Campaign Communism History of the United States (1988-present) Democracy First Indochina War Battle of France Joseph Stalin Keynesian economics Vegeta Shaggy dog story Polish-Soviet War Taliban European Theatre of World War II Wu-Tang Clan affiliates Battle of Normandy 1957 World Series Operation Barbarossa Abu Musab al-Zarqawi Entropy Eastern Front (World War II) Hyperinflation Luftwaffe George F.

was abraham lincoln against segregation lincoln's support for segregation is not exactly what some try to make it out to be to begin with lincoln certainly did not think of blacks as 'less than human' more on that below and it is an absurd distortion of the emancipation proclamation to say that it didn't free any slaves or that lincoln didn't really care about their being freed he has left a long trail of evidence writings speeches and actions to the contrary now it is true that lincoln for most of his political career though not at the end was a proponent of a particular type of separation one that involved emancipation and colonization of the slave population but more as a solution to a difficult problem to rid the nation of the evil of slavery as well as to give former slaves a chance for a better life it is misleading to simply call this segregation without explanation of his purposes or attitude or without paying any attention to the context in which he lived and acted first note that when we think of segregation we think of animosity and often of a view of some whites that blacks are inferior perhaps not quite fully human and not possessing the same human rights as whites if you look at lincoln's full statements on these matters not just sentences and half sentences ripped out of context you find that from the early s on he argued on numerous occasions that blacks were part of the all men of the declaration of independence and were entitled to the rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that does not mean lincoln had enlightened views about race relations hardly anyone did in his day he appears to have shared the views of his countrymen in opposition for instance to racial intermarriage but the only time he said much about all this was during the lincoln douglas debates when he was seeking to blunt charges from douglas meant to wound him politically that is he was only responding to accusations not advocating his own program several times he disavowed plans to bring about social and political equality between the white and black races but he did not display animosity and in the next breath he would add i have made it equally plain that i think the negro is included in the word men used in the declaration of independence i believe the declaration that all men are created equal is the great fundamental principle upon which our free institutions rest that negro slavery is violative of that principle letter to j u brown oct http www gutenberg org files txt compare the following i have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the black races there is a physical difference between the two which in my judgment will probably forbid their ever living together upon the footing of perfect equality and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference i as well as judge douglas am in favor of the race to which i belong having the superior position i have never said anything to the contrary but i hold that notwithstanding all this there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the declaration of independence the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness i hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man i agree with judge douglas he is not my equal in many respects certainly not in color perhaps not in moral or intellectual endowments but in the right to eat the bread without leave of anybody else which his own hand earns he is my equal and the equal of judge douglas and the equal of every living man speech at columbus ohio september http www gutenberg org files txt in line with all this lincoln insisted that slavery was a moral evil though one that the constitution did not allow people including the president to simply do away with his solution was that slavery must be contained not allowed to spread in the expectation that this would cause it to die out in the south as it had in the north he also had the notion that if the border states would accept compensated emancipation with the freed slaves being colonized the states then in rebellion seeing this would be open to reconciliation and to a similar plan to bring slavery to an end all these plans however came to an end with the emancipation proclamation once it was finalized on january he never argued for colonization again over the next two years he fought fiercely to guarantee the freedom and basic rights of blacks would be maintained after the war esp by his efforts to gain passage of the th amendment which applied to the whole nation more than that by the end of the war he was advocating that at least some blacks have the right to vote in other words he was now arguing that they ought to have political equality this is a shift from his pre war position note that lincoln always sought a constitutional solution this is why the emancipation proclamation applied only in areas then in rebellion lincoln's only constitutional authority for emancipating slaves was as part of the president's war powers that is as a means to undermine the rebellion he had no authority to emancipate otherwise also the proclamation did free slaves first it secured the freedom of those who had already fled then that of slaves in any territory the union armies were able to prevail in by the end of the war when the th amendment was not yet ratified it had freed slaves in all the confederate states lincoln was concerned that given the evil legacy of slavery blacks could never enjoy equal treatment in the white society that had enslaved them indeed there was something to his concern as seen in the strong southern backlash against reconstruction from black codes to lynchings until it finally fell apart the north losing the political will to continue and freed blacks were forced to live under the jim crow regime to get some idea of why lincoln argued for colonization considering the following quotes if as the friends of colonization hope the present and coming generations of our countrymen shall by any means succeed in freeing our land from the dangerous presence of slavery and at the same time in restoring a captive people to their long lost father land with bright prospects for the future and this too so gradually that neither races nor individuals shall have suffered by the change it will indeed be a glorious consummation from his eulogy on henry clay july http www gutenberg org files txt your race are suffering in my judgment the greatest wrong inflicted on any people but even when you cease to be slaves you are yet far removed from being placed on an equality with the white race address on colonization to a deputation of colored men washington august http

according to john locke what is the purpose of government john locke is a very complicated philosopher and you should not rely upon a forum like this for any kind of complete answer this quote is from wikpedia where you should go for more details it is much too long to write here representative government it is a misconception that locke and his social contract demanded a democracy rather locke felt that a legitimate contract could exist between citizens and monarchies or oligarchies his ideas heavily influenced however both the american and french revolutions his notions of people's rights and the role of civil government provided strong support for the intellectual movements of both revolutions edit right of revolution locke believed that the relationship between the state and its citizens took the form of a 'contract ' whereby the governed agreed to surrender certain freedoms they enjoyed under the state of nature in exchange for the order and protection provided by a state exercised according to the rule of law however if the state oversteps its limits and begins to exercise arbitrary power it forfeits its 'side' of the contract and thus the contract becomes void the citizens not only have the right to overthrow the state but are indeed morally compelled to revolt and replace it a secondary view on locke's position of revolution argues that locke requires that the legislative power must be dissolved not by the actions of the common people which effectively puts people back into the state of nature this view would not suggest that people have the right to revolt but rather to resist an arbitrary power to dissolve itself in order to make way for a new political structure  Liberalism Civil rights Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Property (ownership right) Democracy American individualist anarchism Political philosophy State Two Treatises of Government Republicanism John Locke Social justice Separation of church and state Age of Enlightenment Libertarianism Politics of Canada Republic Constitution Social contract Coercion American Revolution Conservatism United States Constitution Constitution of the United Kingdom Constitutional monarchy Human rights American Conservatism Freedom of the press Treaty Objectivist philosophy Victor Cousin Freedom of speech Free trade Government Government of France Soviet Union Roe v.

which charecter according to you stood out and occupied an important position in the world between he she can be good or bad as you are giving me the option of good or bad i would say that hitler rightfully deserves that position after all the havoc he lashed upon the world here's my narrative of the life of hitler and then i am sure you'll agree with my view hitler the rise of evil the saga of the rise of hitler is that of a frenzied and preposterous ambition that plunged the entire world in brutal war for almost a decade only an army corporal in world war i hitler rose through the ranks and his thirst for power was only quenched after he ascended to the post of chancellor of germany years later his rambling and immensely emotional autobiography mein kampf reveals everything about his noticeably unstable early life hitler was born adolf g hitler in austria his father wanted him to study for a government job but the thought of slogging in an office made hitler sick he yearned to be an artist and practiced water colour painting but he achieved little later on he approached the vienna art academy but he was rejected and labeled untalented failure dogged him all these humbling experiences flamed his discontent for his patchwork country austria he looked across the border to magnificent germany flourishing with an unending flow of wealth and blooming with unhindered development hitler's hatred of poverty his rabid and radical devotion to his german heritage and his bigoted loathing of jews combined to form the seeds of his later successful political doctrine hitler left wretched vienna for munich a true german town there he drifted from job to job as carpenter architect's draftsman and watercolorist always he ranted about his political ideas during world war i he gave up his austrian citizenship and enlisted himself in the german army he was a remarkably brave soldier and his unflinching gallantry won him the iron cross unfortunately for him germany was defeated and he landed up in an infirmary temporarily blinded my mustard gas having renounced his austrian citizenship and yet to become a german citizen hitler was now a man without a country in the aftermath of the war munich was caught in a political tirade officers like hitler were used as political spies this marked the turning point of hitler s life on one such cold night of spying hitler guided by intuition ended up as the seventh member of a meeting around a broken gas lamp it consisted of a motley group of army officers painters artisans and crafts men who nursed one ambition ruling germany hitler soon took control of this faction this diverse group went on to become the distinguished nazi party with hitler as its leader the party began to garner supporters hitler s voice torn and hoarsened by mustard gas was hypnotic his audience just remained spell bound he indeed was an effective speaker sneering at the liberal generalities of the various bourgeois parties and hating the communists hitler shouted accusations against the jews and cried out to the germans to form an all powerful national state the flamboyant spirit of the growing nazi party now began to attract the varied restless men who were to become its core the party grew in strength in terms of followers it grew so politically powerful that it started thinking of overthrowing the government well this is precisely what hitler did he with the backing of the brutal nazis attacked a government meeting in a beer hall and tried to seize the reins of governance but he miserably failed accused of high treason and found guilty hitler was thrown in prison due to the immense public uproar his term of sentence was reduced to eight months it was during his time at prison that he wrote the epic mein kampf with the help of the loyal rudolf hess hitler emerged from prison to the roaring applause of the people it was blatantly apparent that he undeniably was a demi god for them after serving his term in captivity he remarked that it would take years for him to rekindle the flame of passion in the hearts of the people what he said was true at the time of his release germany was prospering and revolutions don t flourish in prosperity in a world wide depression hit germany poverty grief and hardship was staring the germans the nazis underwent regeneration they were back stronger than ever this time with the persistent support of the communalists and army personnel the blatant supremacy of the nazis was inevitable hitler was appointed the chancellor of germany and from then onwards he started striving towards his goal of global conquest his quest for power ultimately ended when he rose to become the dictator of germany chief instigator of world war ii hitler was also the master mind behind the mass genocide of jews called holocaust as all of us know germany was finally defeated in ww ii and hitler committed suicide ending a sort of legend in a very desolate fashion among germans during his time hitler was considered as a super man nazi propaganda had made of hitler a symbol of strength and national virtue his indecisions were cloaked as intuition despite his hours and even days of brooding inertia he was pictured as a man of intense action he became idolized by young germans covering his unsavory and cruel character propaganda built a legend of his ascetic habits and selfless devotion to germany after all that i have written above i can indubitably state that hitler through his life and times can be considered as an epitome of sinister malevolence and malicious wickedness though an excellent orator and courageous combatant i feel that hitler could have done much better had he channelized his talents in any other constructive field hitler through his life showed the world that even one man with a strong will can make a world of difference  Karl Haushofer Nazi architecture Ludwig Wittgenstein Democracy Anti-Semitism Albert Speer Marie

what was the black hole in the history of india the black hole of calcutta was a small dungeon where troops of the nawab of bengal siraj ud daulah held british prisoners of war after the capture of fort william on june john zephaniah holwell claimed that following the fall of the fort british and anglo indian soldiers and civilians were held overnight in conditions so cramped that a large proportion of those held died from suffocation heat exhaustion and crushing he claimed that prisoners died out of prisoners held doubt has been cast on both the numbers alleged and on whether the incident happened at all and some modern historians have suggested the incident was fabricated by holwell as a piece of propaganda to blacken the image of siraj the british established fort william to protect british east india company trade in the city of calcutta in the region of bengal in implicitly with a latent dream of colonizing bengal as well as all of india and explicitly in preparation for anticipated skirmishes with french forces the british began building up fort william's military strength and defences the nawab of bengal siraj ud daulah was unhappy with the british company's direct politico military interference with the internal affairs of his country and perceived a direct threat to the independence of bengal as the ruler of bengal he ordered an immediate stop to the fort's military enhancement but the company did not heed his order as such siraj organised his army and laid siege to the fort whose defenders took many casualties the garrison's commander organised an escape and left a token force in the military fort under the command of john zephaniah holwell a one time military surgeon who was a top east india company civil servant desertions by allied troops mainly dutch made even this temporary defence untenable and the fort was taken holwell wrote an account of the incident in which he claimed that of prisoners suffocated when imprisoned in the tiny room his version of events which was not challenged by other survivors was widely accepted at the time in britain indian soldiers took the surviving defenders prisoner who numbered from to together with an unknown number of anglo indian soldiers and other persons of mixed ancestry many of them civilians who had been sheltering in the fort during this period some prisoners were able to escape and others attacked their guards according to holwell the troops apparently acting on their own then packed the prisoners in a guard room measuring by ft by m and locked them in overnight prisoners begged for water or escape growing delirious from heat exhaustion as time passed men collapsed from heat stroke suffocation or trampling the prisoners were not released until morning when siraj ud daulah awoke by then certain modern historians believe some members of the garrison were dead or missing for other reasons but because so many non combatants were present in the fort when it fell the number that died cannot be stated with any precision the corpses were thrown into a ditch holwell and three others were sent as prisoners to murshidabad the rest of the survivors obtained their liberty after the victory of a relief expedition under robert clive the black hole was later used as a warehouse and an obelisk feet m high was erected in memory of the dead the following description from a encyclopedia portrays holwell's point of view vividly the dungeon was a strongly barred room and was not intended for the confinement of more than two or three men at a time there were only two windows and a projecting veranda outside and thick iron bars within impeded the ventilation while fires raging in different parts of the fort suggested an atmosphere of further oppressiveness the prisoners were packed so tightly that the door was difficult to close one of the soldiers stationed in the veranda was offered rupees to have them removed to a larger room he went away but returned saying it was impossible the bribe was then doubled and he made a second attempt with a like result the nawab was asleep and no one dared wake him by nine o'clock several had died and many more were delirious a frantic cry for water now became general and one of the guards more compassionate than his fellows caused some to be brought to the bars where mr holwell and two or three others received it in their hats and passed it on to the men behind in their impatience to secure it nearly all was spilt and the little they drank seemed only to increase their thirst self control was soon lost those in remote parts of the room struggled to reach the window and a fearful tumult ensued in which the weakest were trampled or pressed to death they raved fought prayed blasphemed and many then fell exhausted on the floor where suffocation put an end to their torments about o'clock the prisoners began to drop off fast at length at six in the morning siraj ud dowla awoke and ordered the door to be opened of the only including mr holwell from whose narrative published in the annual register for this account is partly derived remained alive and they were either stupefied or raving fresh air soon revived them and the commander was then taken before the nawab who expressed no regret for what had occurred and gave no other sign of sympathy than ordering the englishman a chair and a glass of water notwithstanding this indifference mr holwell and some others acquit him of any intention of causing the catastrophe and ascribe it to the malice of certain inferior officers but many think this opinion unfounded holwell's account included a summary of the alleged victims list of the smothered in the black hole prison exclusive of sixty nine consisting of dutch and english sergeants corporals

claims that one hundred and twenty three died of one hundred and forty six held while his account was not questioned in britain at the time other contemporary accounts claimed a larger number and

veracity arguing that holwell was an unreliable witness and his veracity is questionable little went so far as to label holwell's version a gigantic hoax other historians including indian scholar

why does asia dislike japan should japan apologize you already know the answers because of the war crimes done during ww ii my personal opinion is that japan or the countries whose armies made crimes should not apologize because that makes no difference instead they should try never to minimize the number of victims or disregard the nature of their sufferings that is so much better than saying we re sorry we won t do it again because you ll be bound to repeat it every once in a while just like in personal life and you ll have a feeling of collective guilt and hence a good soil for aggression in national corpus which leads to repeating crimes it s a circulus vitiosus but if you just learn about things done in past with a critical review of course you ll probably have some better feeling of being able and responsible not to allow such things to happen again  Responses of Germany and Japan to World War II crimes Comfort women Capital punishment Japanese war crimes Theory of conduct A Course In Miracles Expulsion of Germans after World War II Attack on Pearl Harbor Reparations for slavery Hideki Tojo Yusuf al-Qaradawi Scientology beliefs and practices Slander and libel Simone Weil Japanese history textbook controversies Socrates Anti-Japanese sentiment Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus International law National Kidney Foundation Singapore The Brothers Karamazov Narcissism Crime Aesthetic Realism Unlawful combatant Domestic violence Anschluss Evil Nanking Massacre Sadism and masochism Antisocial personality disorder Rape Paranoia Agent Holocaust denial Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Foreign policy of Japan Colonial Cambodia Novel Child sexual abuse Sin Christian apologetics Treaty of Versailles Transactional analysis Torture Diplomatic immunity Murder Criticism of libertarianism Yasukuni Shrine Theodicy Rhapsody in August Imperial Japanese Army Noam Chomsky Causes of World War II International Criminal Court Autism Plame affair World War II Moral objectivism Dyslexia Dennis Rader Philipp Melanchthon Presuppositional apologetics Domon Kasshu Surrender of Japan Strategic management John Lott Divorce Clinical depression Pacific War Objectivist philosophy Scenes from a Memory Intelligent design Sook Ching massacre Hearsay Racism Social justice Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Social rule Japanese language Involuntary commitment Plato Funeral Due process Infantilism Non-aggression principle British Army Shinto Political correctness Crime against peace Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway Dead Like Me Self-esteem Roper v.

what was the war truly about between the north and south dont be fooled they wanted one ceri ance money people then the slaves so maney ran north thats when they said it must end all slavery witch was a good thing for the people if you want the typical yahoo answers thoughtless dubious and undoubtedly wrong answer go with states rights slavery was not an issue lincoln said too many times to count that he would endorse slavery if it would end the war and jeff davis said he would have no problem with abolition if the confederacy was allowed to survive as a collection of independent nations if you are really interested you need to do some reading one hopes you can do that better than you can write start with some of the things the southern statesmen were saying to their northern brethren in when the new england states threatened to secede better still go back to the arguments pro and con of a single strong central government while the states were all independent nations under the articles of confederation during the drafting of the constitution and apply those thoughts to and beyond the civil war was a criminally stupid unnecessary bloodletting brought on by arrogant extremists and blundering politicians who could not resolve their differences by diplomatic means on the other hand the civil war was an inevitable consequence of the independence won by the colonies in with the treaty of versailles the southern colonies by all rights should have formed a separate and distinct nation or nations then however the bonds created by the common cause of the recent insurrection spawned a false unity between the colonies which culminated with the ratification of the constitution in and its implementation in the southern states especially virginia could live with detente with the north for the next or decades because most of the positions of power were held by southerners notably virginians as the north expanded westward and northern dollars diminished southern power and position things got more and more dicey until south carolina said enough is enough and pulled out of the union in december it took a few more months for lincoln to get inaugurated and for the shooting to start but once south carolina attempted to secede the north was committed to a fight to the death to keep the upstart states in the fold likewise the southern states having told new england in that they couldn't secede were going to fight to the death for their freedom and independence bear in mind that by in the southern states had more history as independent or quasi independent entities than they had had as a subject unit in a larger whole and couple that with the american spirit of independence an freedom they had thumbed their noses at the most powerful nation on the planet and gotten away with it largely by force of southern arms in the hands of southern troops under direction of southern leaders if king george couldn't beat them the wannabes in the north were sure as heck not going to tell them what they could and couldn't do the north on the other hand didn't want a potential enemy on its southern border who might ally with france or britain in an effort by the europeans to reclaim some of their lost ground in the mississippi basin and the north didn't want competition with its conquest of the west several western northern and border states would have joined in the confederate cause but geography and proximity to northern troops convinced them that discretion might better prevail the mentality of the war is nicely summed up by the case of robert e lee his views on slavery were not too dissimilar from lincoln's and he viewed his slaves as better off on his plantation than they would be in africa lincoln actually carried it a little further and said that as long as there were two races the weaker as a basic fact of life would be subjugated by the stronger lee opposed the secession of virginia from the union but he turned down command of the union army out of loyalty to virginia therein lies the basic difference between north and south and the simplified leading cause of the war southerners considered themselves citizens of their state while northerners and westerners thought of themselves as americans first that would be a product of the mobility of the industrial and mercantile north versus the multi generational residence of the southerners on their farms and plantations the world was passing the south by and the confederate oligarchs wanted to maintain an untenable status quo the hoi poloi bought into their rhetoric the north was more concerned with continuing the growth and expansion of a vibrant and virile new nation with aspirations to be an international power the immovable object was going to be hit sometime by the irresistible force the only question was when south carolina answered the question in december the arguments were old and stale in december they had been hashed and rehashed in in in in and in aaron burr tried putting the secessionist arguments into practice in but the virginia militia put down his attempt and arrested him the arguments continued with increasing rancor until the guns were drawn at fort sumter on april eventually after the war the us actually became united states as opposed to being independent states linked together by a piece of paper the pity is that the diplomats actually delayed the start of the war by at least years had it been fought in as it almost was the loss of life and property would have been far less severe the irony is that the southern traitors of were saying the same things that their grandfathers had said in while the northern patriots were disavowing those same treasonous ravings of their grandfathers both the war of and that of were insurrections fought by disloyal subjects against their rightful sovereign over bogus and manufactured grievances the difference is the southerners still believed the rationale of applied in

can someone tell the history of the yakuza from the crime library the origin of the yakuza is a matter of some debate some feel that its members are descendents of the th century kabuki mono crazy ones outlandish samurai who reveled in outlandish clothing and hair styles spoke in elaborate slang and carried unusually long swords in their belts the kabuki mono were also known as hatamoto yakko servants of the shogun during the tokugawa era an extended period of peace in japan the services of these samurai were no longer needed and so they became leaderless ronin wave men without the guidance of a strong hand they eventually shifted their focus from community service to theft and mayhem modern yakuza members refute this theory and instead proclaim themselves to be the descendents of the machi yokko servants of the town who protected their villages from the wayward hatamoto yakko the official yakuza history portrays the group's ancestors as underdog folk heroes who stood up for the poor and the defenseless just as robin hood helped the peasants of medieval england current yakuza members fall under three general categories tekiya street peddlers bakuto gamblers and gurentai hoodlums the peddlers and gamblers trace their roots back to the th century while the hoodlums came into existence after world war ii when the demand for black market goods created a booming industry traditionally the tekiya medieval japan's version of snake oil salesmen worked the fairs and markets while the bakuto worked the towns and highways the gurentai by contrast modeled themselves on american gangsters of the al capone era using threats and extortion to achieve their ends after world war ii in the governmental power void caused by the occupation the gurentai prospered and their ranks swelled they also brought organized crime in japan to a new level of violence replacing the traditional sword with modern firearms even though guns were now officially outlawed in the country as a result of the surrender the yakuza are proud to be outcasts and the word yakuza reflects the group's self image as society's rejects or you could try everything you always wanted to know about the japanese mafia http web telia com u yakuza htm  Tokugawa shogunate Forty-seven Ronin Samurai Jidaigeki Ninja Burakumin Katana History of Japan Kabuki Seppuku Shogun Characters of Naruto Edo period Japan Triad History of theater Mafia Gang German Empire Japanese war crimes Military history of Japan Samurai Deeper Kyo Emperor of Japan Muromachi period Meiji period Sento Oda Nobunaga Tokugawa Ieyasu Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia Love and Theft Toyotomi Hideyoshi Kamakura period Leadership Professional wrestling attacks Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mercantilism Imperial Japanese Navy Bushido Cowboy Bebop Libertarian socialism Anarchism and society Japanese literature Nagasaki Pornography in Japan Homosexuality in Japan Gangster Clothing Nanban trade period Japanese name Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Shinto Capital accumulation Trade union Superhero Jacobo Arenas Left-wing politics Foreign policy of Japan Militarism-Socialism in Showa Japan William Adams Tariff Unemployment Martial art ETA Keynesian economics Samurai Champloo Airsoft Economic history of Japan Bosniaks Imperial Japanese Army Criminal tattoo Inflation Music genre Aikido Wyatt Earp Rurouni Kenshin Dalit (outcaste) Waka Sohei Liberalism Early modern warfare Karaoke Free trade Globalization Organized crime Russian Mafia Yojimbo (film) Rastafari movement Jewish principles of faith Firearm

how do you feel about the magna carta what is your opinion it depends on which version you mean but none of them are legal documents given the circumstances under which john signed that being said i do have to express my admiration and respect for the barons who among other things proclaimed for all time that haberject would forever be measured at two ells within the selvedge wine and ale would be measured by the london quarter or that if one died in debt to a jew the debt would not accrue interest until the eldest heir came of age and likewise if his estate was insufficient to repay the debt his widow didn't have to pay it methinks the barons were goys or one was exempt from giving more than market value as knight's fees unless compelling circumstances justified more a real stroke for freedom and liberty was the fact that under the charter barons and earls could only be fined by earls and barons but at least no one else had to build a bridge unless he had an obligation already to do so it was really good that magna carte allowed knights serving abroad to skip their castle guard duties cut down on awols tremendously taking the weirs off the medway except along the coast was probably a good thing deforesting was probably something the sierra club would have bristled at but hey the barons didn't want the trees gloria steinem probably didn't like that fact that murder charges couldn't be brought by a woman unless the stiff was her old man it was kind of nice that john got to hang on the the lands that his daddy henry and his big brother richard stole from the welsh but at least llywelyn's son was released it was also pretty swell that all the foreign troops would be sent home after the war was done have you read the charter do you know the context in which it was signed what is one to think of it the barons won and runnymede was their reward they looked out for themselves pretty well as a document of individual freedom and liberty well it isn't and that was not the intent of the baron's who were holding their swords and lances to john's throat it is a specific document which addresses itself to specific issues and while it maintains the fealty of the peerage it also retains the primacy of the crown  British monarchy John of England Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus History of the British constitution Theory of conduct Babylonian law First Barons' War United States Constitution Edward I of England History of the Jews in England Richard III of England William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke Wars of the Roses Henry I of England Duke of Norfolk British Royal Family Peerage History of the Peerage Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Coronation of the British monarch Life peer Allodial title Monarchy in Canada Anne of Great Britain Earl of Derby Owain Glynd__r Parliament of the United Kingdom Francis Bacon Plame affair Hereditary peer Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles Szlachta History of Schleswig-Holstein Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Robert Walpole Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead Privilege of Peerage Freedom of speech Unreformed House of Commons Courtesy title American individualist anarchism Duke of Hamilton Insurance Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester Llywelyn the Great Baron Tax Edward VIII of the United Kingdom Right Knots Landing Merit Constitution Duke of Somerset United Kingdom corporation tax Separation of church and state George III of the United Kingdom Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Mortgage Bond Ranulph de Gernon, 2nd Earl of Chester Freedom of the press History of Poland (966-1385) Henry VIII of England Richard I of England Edward II of England Robert I of Scotland George IV of the United Kingdom Appeal Frederic Thesiger, 1st Baron Chelmsford Roman Catholic Church John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough History of the Isle of Man Due process Humphrey Bogart Contract William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham Louis XIV of France Usury Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Ten Commandments Constitution of Ireland Intellectual property Charles, Prince of Wales Earl of Albemarle Simone Weil Sampling (music) Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Pretender Roger de Mortimer, 1st Earl of March

i think that it is ironic that so many ppl demonize germany during ww germany invaded many european nations however many of these nations had done the exact same thing to many other nations as well such as france and england england did some real brutal things to many other nations in the past and right after ww was over france was trying to regain her colonies in algeria and vietnam yeah yeah i know all about the holocaust and all the horrible things that happend but i think its great that these other european nations that were attacked by germany it was time that they got what they deserved robert i already mentioned the holocaust you idiot that is not my point dumbass just look what the jews do today to the arabs very simaler to what the nazis did to them of course not the same nothing is ever the same but there are parallels to it robert robert robert at least learn something of language and history before going off on a quasi pedantic rant the nazis didn't start the war that was done by the treaty of versailles read a little of what woody wilson was saying at the time the treaty was negotiated the rest of europe and washington were not displeased with the nazi rise to power it stabilized germany and created a natural buffer against stalin and the soviets there was a reason that hitler was named man of the year in by time magazine your totals on the camps are woefully lacking the actual total is closer to million of them only about million were jews and only half of those died in the death camps do learn to distinguish between the death camps and the concentration camps by the way jasenovac had the highest body count of the death camps after only auschwitz ii birkenau and belzek jasenovac was not established to kill jews and the jews comprise a small minority of those who did die there the camp totals don't take into account the millions of russians serbs slavs poles and ukraines who were simply killed rather than marched off to processing centers the world didn't care what was going on with the jews at the time and the documentation is irrefutable that the world knew any number of pronouncements and actions from the capitals of europe and washington prove this beyond the shadow of a doubt the saddest part of the holocaust is that most of the victims are forgotten the nazis were not about killing jews to the exclusion of the rest of their targets and they did a much more complete job on the serbs and romas the millions of slavs who were scheduled for extinction were saved by joe stalin the red army the us wasn't particularly concerned about the nazis with full knowledge of what was going on the us congress decided to continue the draft by a single vote a few months before pearl harbor of course operation f had not been implemented at that time so the final solution was not an issue hitler was anti jewish that was a product of his education his upbringing and over years of dogma from the vatican and the ruling classes of europe dating from before the roman empire when you speak of anti semitic arabs though you kind of lose all credibility you pretty much lost any credibility when you couldn't even spell the word the jews constitute a minority of the semites in the world today they are far outnumbered by their arab cousins point of fact we know the present day palestinians have no historical claim to palestine as a traditional homeland because they in fact are semites while the palestinians who disappeared into babylon before persia took control of the region were not historic 'palestinians' where extinct before rome was founded as for the nukes i guess it's a good thing the german scientists who built the bomb decided to do it here isn't it but for hitler's jewish policy they may have stayed home and built it there as to the necessity justification legality and morality of dropping them i'll let dwight eisenhower chester nimitz douglas macarthur robert oppenheimer and curtis le may among others who were more privy to the facts and circumstances than me and than harry truman speak for me but i tend to agree with le may that if japan won he and harry truman would have been on the block for war crimes and i surely can't argue with chet ike and mac the commanders in the field as to the total pointlessness and lack of military purpose of the attacks the japanese surrender was a foregone conclusion and the invasion of japan would not have been necessary if there was military purpose to the bombings at least one of them would have been dropped on a militarily significant target and if saving us troop lives was an issue one would think japanese troop concentrations somewhere within miles of the intended invasion route would have been somewhat close to ground zero at least one of the next eleven planned drops would have been aimed at something of military significance wouldn't you think they weren't the way stalin and the soviets were plowing through manchuria signaled to truman that papa joe and mao needed an object lesson pity a couple generations of japanese babies born with all manner of birth defects since the war that provided the lesson along with the quarter million or so japanese civilians and to thousand american civilians and pows who were incinerated mengele if you are going to suggest that someone look something up it would expedite the research if you could spell the name correctly worked on live but condemned subjects truman went after the unborn however it should make you feel better to know that the firebombing of tokyo killed far more people mostly civilians than did either fat man or little boy and beyond dresden germany had its share of firebombings destroyed cities and dead civilians at least in germany the bombings killed far fewer american civilians and pows than were slaughtered by enola gay and bokscar at hiroshima and nagasaki the soviets did their part for you too don't be sad stalin did for you what patton couldn't if you need a bigger lift more german civilians died in the war than did german troops if you take the soviets and poland out of the mix more germans over half of whom were civilians died in the war than did the rest of europe combined this should really make your day germans deaths outnumbered japanese by about to even with the nukes finally if you are going to condemn a nation and a people for its barbarism and savagery take a good look at the usa heydrich and himmler did the modern world's first concentration camps were established in at ross's landing chattanooga tennessee fort payne alabama and fort cass charleston tennessee martin van buren called them emigration depots the cherokee didn't really care what they were called dead is dead by any name the term concentration camp wasn't coined until the british came up with it during the boer wars some years later heydrich and himmler were pretty impressed with the activities of the us bureau of indian affairs as well the didn't particularly like the tactics of billy sherman and nellie 'bearcoat' miles because that would cost too many bullets and allow the foe to make a pretense of fighting back but they did learn the lessons of feeding the starving captives rotted tainted meat and giving them smallpox infested blankets zyklon b was much more merciful fact they got more than a few of their ideas from uncle sam and the indians they said that not me to youyo you are of course correct insofar as your accusations of france and britain are concerned however the victor writes the history and it is so much easier to point fingers at others than to look at oneself since you fail to mention the us in your list of folks who have committed atrocities and since the us is the first modern nation to have engaged in a prolonged campaign of genocide over a period spanning generations you can see how well the propaganda works we'll leave the american slavery experiment out of the discussion for now but you really should compare american slavery to that of other nations so you can appreciate how truly egregious it was maybe that's why of the american population bought into georgie the younger's rap years ago that the invasions of afghanistan and iraq were moral legal and justified this in spite of all the treaties and agreements the us has signed which preclude a preemptive war and in spite of the condemnation of the world before the troops went in and in spite of the fact that neither iraq nor afghanistan posed any threat to us security or interests and in spite of the fact that the folks against whom the invasions were aimed had been us allies just a decade or so before the fact that history screamed out that neither war could be won and that the stated goals were not only out of reach but a sick joke simply makes that support all the more frightening but gives a wonderful object lesson on how a man like hitler can rise to power however to be consistent with your logic that hitler gave france and britain what they deserved i presume that you agree that was a justified attack on a deserving target after all bin ladin is but another spurned us ally just like saddam us support of butchers like shah pahlavi saddam marcos diem and nguyen van thieu to name but a few does not ingratiate uncle sam around the world aside to cychuck germany in terms of loss of life was third not second hardest hit by the war after the ussr and china poland trailed germany by less than a quarter million proportionately speaking poland was hit harder if you count soviet troops million as one group and soviet civilians million as another that pushes china to and germany to the us by comparison lost fewer than thousand and robert before you go off an another rant that the wehrmacht forces deserved it us troops were just following orders in nam and at my lai and panama and granada and afghanistan and iraq and gitmo too the troops don't make policy they follow orders or commit treason anyways stalin after joining the nazis in the invasion of poland was preparing his own invasion of germany so the european war would have happened with or without hitler or fall weiss and barbarossa

causes of the protestant reformation in the th century just give major points i can do the research so far i have corruption in the church simony selling of indulgences discontent among the merchant class toward the forbidden practice of paying interest on money what else am i missing the points you mention led the move to reformation although the earliest reformers simply wanted to reform the church not found a new denomination however as more people became educated and read the bible for themselves many began to question some of the official teachings of the church which actually seemed to be at odds with what was written in the scriptures the harsh penalties imposed by the inquisition on those who questioned the official teachings caused even more people to question eventually this led to protestantism this is a very simple summary of what was actually a very long hard fought process the protestant reformation eventually led to the enlightenment in which original thought study and research were encouraged and from that arose invention and scientific discovery and so forth  Protestant Reformation Protestantism Bible Church of Christ, Scientist Calvinism New Testament Abrahamic religion Biblical canon Evangelicalism Sola scriptura Christianity Trinity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Christian denomination Religious pluralism John Wycliffe Martin Luther Mennonite Jan Hus Divine grace Restorationism Sabbath Lutheranism Book of Mormon Apocrypha United States religious history Presbyterianism Ten Commandments Baptist Jewish principles of faith Judaism Catholic Religion Roman Catholic Church Indulgence History of the Roman Catholic Church Separation of church and state Evolutionary creationism Religious conversion Asceticism Purgatory Unitarianism Liberal Christianity Vestments controversy Christian theological controversy Church of Christ Blacks and Mormonism Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod Clergy Anabaptist Christian Capital punishment Education Second Vatican Council A Course In Miracles John Calvin History of Germany History of science Waldensians Church of Scotland Heresy Late Middle Ages Eucharist Galileo Galilei Afrikaner Calvinism History of the Latter Day Saint movement Community of Christ Intelligent design movement Buddhism Infantilism Creationism Fundamentalism Theodore Beza History of the British constitution Religious Society of Friends Modernism (Roman Catholicism) Evangelical Lutheran Church in America Huldrych Zwingli Franz Boas Leviathan (book) Academia Excommunication Culture of Lithuania Anglicanism Perseverance of the saints Historical persecution by Christians Theology

why did the u s go to war in kosovo this is a war about which i know very little and i bet i'm not alone did slobadon or whoever he was kill hundreds of thousands of people you have to understand how the usa's foreign policy works who runs the political streams in usa and how decisions are being made the system is run by lobbies military lobby petroleum lobby etc and the decisions are being made according to money and interests all these decisions need to be popular thus a powerful media is being used to control the mood of the masses through carefully filtered and biased information one example of this is the american ruder and fin a jewish marketing company which compared the serbs to the nazis when the attack over serbia was much needed you have to throw away everything you have learned about serbia so far believe in just a handful of sources one of them is noam chomsky as mentioned above serbia is leaned toward russia this could represent a local political threat to american interests in some potential future event the region itself is of no interest to usa but controlling it is stepping russia and some potential new loyal military force is not to be wasted the albanians have been investing constantly into the american lobby system influencing congressmen unlike the serbs who have started doing it only recently since much of the veins in albania and kosovo come from saudi arabia iran syria etc there has been certain compensation from usa in allowing their influence to coexist in the region a better example of this are the bosnian muslims whose country in which they control serbs and croats is purely artificial the war in kosovo has deep historical roots with a quite complex political background but what is relevant now is how it was influenced by usa at some point the albanian terrorists found mutual interests with usa against serbs thus conditions in kosovo started escalating to a point where it was just a matter of time when nato was to attack serbia and the way it happened through racak event and un security council disapproval tells by itself only after nato had attacked serbia creating a humanitarian catastrophe in kosovo and an escalation of attrocities which follow every war did the situation get out of control there was no such thing before the nato attack just before the nato attack the yugoslav army had taken control over much of the territory where the terrorists operated milosevic killing hundreds of thousands of people is an example of propaganda there is much guilt you could add to him but what guilt could you add to someone outspoking the hundreds of thousands number calling for a catastrophe to happen and pushing people into it there have been war crime acts in kosovo just like in every war where the human nature is released but should the judging of such event be given to those who create ground for such event to happen those who will end unpunished and ready to create another such catastrophe like inventing some nuclear weapons in iraq killing those who oppose iraq intervention kelly killed by blair in uk etc what you should know about the war of kosovo is that it is just another dirty war caused by usa where the serbs have been satanized by the western media throughout the entire yugoslav civil war through evil systems like cnn and devils like christine amanpour it is a war in which a powerful country crushed a small country going beyond international conventions and agreements which serve peaceful solutions since usa see's itself beyond international laws and conventions and ordinary people were pushed into a bloodshed by their leaders which is the saddest thing of every war covered with tons of depeleted uranium and cassette bombs not aimed at military personel right now the kosovo war is a war about international agreements against those who see themselves above international agreements it is about the meaning of international agreements why they exist in first place added thedoppest that get rid of the cancer theory has a bad flaw the bad thing about it is that there would be only wc relief not to degrade it p if a country gets rid of all political presure in an act of giving away own territory the reality of politics tells that this would only show that such country is weak and is offering everything it has and soon other territories would radicalize toward the same path kosovo would have taken if given such freedom of choice you really want to imply that if you cut your finger and give it to a vampire that the vampire wouldn't go for your entire body nice try lol there is one good thing about being not on the usa side as much as they have infiltered their dirty money into our political and economic structures and as much as they are constantly trying to get into every pore they can it is that we do not have to be their garbage disposal backyard genetic soy garden or rocketbase with nuclear warhead facing moscow i personally find some pleasure in not being that btw did they clean yet the tons of depleted uranium there i feel sorry for those radiated people there and i do understand why you never answer me anything about depleted uranium in context of that the price of a chance to independence through a bargain with usa has turned bloody expensive i think that a long run nonviolent politics leading toward extended autonomy and eu without the depleted uranium drawback would have been a much better choice the information you can dig through the internet on depleted uranium is horrifying cancer has not only risen in kosovo but in serbia and bosnia too children are the issue with several typical health problems hey check yourself what your friends have brought you http www motherjones com news special reports total coverage

why are the bell towers in italy in a separate structure from the cathedrals partially because they tended to collapse but primarily because they were often built at a different time than the rest of the church most of the oldest bell towers in italy are medieval and were built next to churches that were much older in many cases the older church was torn down and replaced so now the tower is older than the church it accompanies  York Minster Gothic architecture Notre Dame de Paris Russian architecture Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace Aberdeen Moscow Kremlin Cologne Cathedral Frankfurt St Albans Cathedral Colchester Spire Duomo di Siena Middle Ages Carillon Lincoln Cathedral Round tower Romanesque architecture Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin Florence Mission San Juan Capistrano Palace of Westminster Gothic Revival architecture Bell (instrument) St Andrews Glasgow Cathedral Stave church Verona Chester Rostov Radio masts and towers Novgorod Bishop Ely Cathedral Kremlin towers Cathedral of Magdeburg Places in the Wheel of Time series Canterbury Cathedral Separation of church and state Campanile Church University of Glasgow Trombone Basilica of St. John The Baptist Robert Lawson (architect) Oakland Cemetery Castle Oxford Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra Cathedral St Paul's Cathedral Old Post Office Building (Washington) World Trade Center Hanover Cathedral of Chartres Organ (music) St. James' Cathedral (Toronto) Ferrara Cathedral architecture Big Ben Potton Christopher Wren Benjamin Mountfort Carlisle Cathedral Baroque architecture Collapse of the World Trade Center Tallest structures in the United States Change ringing Cagliari Towcester Liverpool Cathedral Salisbury Cathedral Leicester City Centre CN Tower Cathedral diagram History of Europe Durham Cathedral Baptistery Lincoln, Lincolnshire Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santa Fe Tower Dresden Frauenkirche Church tabernacle Bologna Trento Washington National Cathedral Saint Petersburg Hagia Sophia Church of England Liverpool World's tallest structures Crane (machine) Berlin Medieval music Lightning rod Brooklyn Bridge Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Portsmouth Cathedral Toronto City Hall

what was so bad about jimmy carter please be specific as far as that whole iran hostage thing goes the iranian revolution was a result of an american foreign policy that went back to the truman eisenhower era when the democratically elected government of iran was overthrown by reza pahlavi the shah with american and british help every american president up to and including carter supported that tyrant people tend to rise up and overthrow such tyrants opportunistic people communist capitalist and religious often exploit situations like this to seize power neo cons tend to lay the blame entirely at carter feet carter was also blasted by the neo cons as are all democrats for advocating a weak military he was widely criticized for killing the b bomber program he felt and i agree that the long range strategic bomber was an obsolete concept he pushed for and got several new trident submarines built carter was probably one of the smartest and most fundamentally moral and ethical men to ever be president he was also one of the most ineffective during carter's administration we had one of the worst periods of stagflation that modern america has ever had a combination of high unemployment and high inflation carter was also unable to get much of the legislation that his administration backed passed congress and the iran hostage crisis put the last nails in the re election coffin this is his biography http www whitehouse gov history presidents jc html i personally think that carter was a good man with good intentions but he came into washington after the nixon ford administrations on a platform of being an outsider who had no connections to the corruption of the watergate era this was appealing to people who had grown weary of the nixon administration's scandals but unfortunately carter just didn't know how to get things done in the insider's maze that makes up our national government the career bureaucrats and politicians that carter had scorned just ate him and his people alive the carter administration had acquired a reputation for incompetence by the time the iran hostage crisis came along and carter's handling of this situation sealed that reputation  Iranian Revolution Iran hostage crisis Democratic Party (United States) Zbigniew Brzezinski Ronald Reagan History of the United States (1980-1988) History of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi Richard Nixon History of the United States Anti-communism U.S. presidential election, 1980 Reagan Administration Mohammed Mossadegh Gerald Ford 1970s Vietnam War Cold War (1962-1991) US health reform under Carter Republican Party (United States) Background history of the September 11, 2001 attacks Pahlavi dynasty Henry Kissinger Paul Wolfowitz The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power George H.

why was the code of conduct significant in the han dynasty the han empire began in bc when liu bang prince of the han defeated the qin army in the valley of the wei the defeat was part of a larger rebellion that began after the first emperor's death the people were dissatisfied with the tyranny of the qin leaders and their legalist form of government however while chinese history portrays the han as having implemented many changes to the government evidence shows that the han continued to rule in the tradition of the qin only gradually incorporating confucian ideals into their legalist form of government economic expansion changing relationships with the people of the steppes strengthening the palace at the expense of the civil service weakening the state''s hold on the peasantry and the rise of the rich and the gentry were all factors that led to the adoption of confucian ideals under this new form of legalism and confucianism rewards and punishments were still used for the common people however the administrators were judged according to confucian principles with the justification for these different sets of standards as they were educated as a last resort the ruler could use punishment for both the people and the officials it was believed that force alone was not sufficient enough to rule so the emperor needed the help of the confucians to guide him morally evidence of rulers using power to punish is found in records of beheaded officials the han dynasty actually consists of two separate dynasties it is considered as one dynasty by the chinese because the second dynasty was founded by a member of the former han dynasty who declared that he had restored the han dynasty the original han dynasty was overthrown when wealthy families gained more power than the emperor the families became allies through marriage and were responsible for the selection of officials the widow of emperor y andi succeeded in placing all of her relatives in government and ruled in place of her son her nephew wang mang eventually declared himself emperor of a new dynasty the xin new his rise as emperor is unusual because he gained much public support and began the ceremony where a seal of the precious stone was passed to the emperor from then on whoever held the seal was the official emperor wang was overthrown by a secret society of peasants known as the red eyebrows they painted their eyebrows red descendents of the han eventually joined in the uprising and it was the armies of these nobles under the leadership of liu xiu who killed wang in the year the fighting continued until the year when liu became emperor as emperor liu was called emperor guang wudi millions of people died during the fighting leaving land behind for peasants and often freedom from debt as lenders passed away  Chimei Yuan Dynasty Qin Shi Huang Ruzi Ying Emperor Ai of Han Xiao He Ming Dynasty Three Kingdoms L__lin Emperor Ling of Han Cao Cao Emperor Ping of Han Qing Dynasty Chinese nobility Taoism Emperor of Japan Emperor Cheng of Han Military history of China Liu Yan Romance of the Three Kingdoms Han Xin Guan Yu Warring States Period Traditional Chinese law Zhang Liang Joseon Dynasty Chinese surname Emperor Ming of Han Zhuge Liang Emperor of China Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period Liu Bei Cultural Revolution Emperor Zhao of Han Empress Dowager Cixi Spring and Autumn Period Han Zhao Chinese sovereign Buddhism in China Personages of the Three Kingdoms Empress Wang (Ping) Emperor Emperor An of Han L__ Clan Disturbance Qin (state) British monarchy History of Korea Emperor Huan of Han Mughal Empire Tokugawa shogunate Hongwu Emperor Yongle Emperor Edo period House of Bourbon Zhao Yun Emperor Wen of Han Empress Guo Shengtong Confucius Emperor Zhang of Han Taiping Rebellion Chinese art Ge Hong Huo Guang Consort Fu Fujian History of Poland (1795-1918) Emperor Hui of Han Emperor He of Han Jiangsu Empress Wu People's Republic of China Politics of the People's Republic of China Chiang Kai-shek Wu Hu Emperor Jing of Han Henry VIII of England Kamakura period Chinese Civil War Emperor Yi of Chu Muscovy

how long does a person have to be dead before it's no longer correct to refer to him as the late so and so i recently read a newspaper story that referred to the late robert f kennedy he's been dead for almost forty years could i say the late leonardo da vinci or the late genghis khan i don't think that it ever becomes inapropriate to call someone the late but usually it is only used as a title to avoid confusing the living with the dead it's like saying the former president bush but not the former president roosevelt or the former president adams when more than one person might be referred to by the same name a suffix or prefix is often added to distinguish them or one is known by his middle name as well hans holbein the younger john quincy adams especially if they were not father son to be distinguished by sr jr or i ii iii the word late is also used to let people know that someone has died so the reporter might think that someone hasn't picked up a newspaper in yrs and might need to be imformed that jfk is dead maybe they were in a coma i don't know if it is in this use it is usually just a polite way to correct someone who has misassumed that someone is still alive oh is that a photo of your wife my late wife yes  President of the United States Family name Japanese name Suffix (name) John Quincy Adams Famous last words Vice President of the United States Genghis Khan Gender-neutral language Spanish verbs Plame affair Family John F.

could someone tell me the real story about slavery sure as human beings began to enter organized and 'civilized' societies they realized that some indeed many of the people around them were less 'civilized' than themselves this discovery led them to turn on the people in their near vicinity and enslave them with threats of killing and beatings etc as time progressed societies continued to get more 'civilized ' they realized that if they went to a distant area and uprooted people and dragged them somewhere completely unfamiliar they would be helpless if they escaped so they started carrying people away from their homelands and enslaving them abroad to help coax them into working better and continued to beat and threaten to kill etc to encourage their slaves with the accumulated wealth from more efficient slavery societies continued to grow even more 'civilized ' they soon discovered that religion and or superstitions and promises of eternal torture etc were even more effective means of enslaving people and what worked even better was convincing them that they were free they also discovered that this could effectively do everything that uprooting slaves had done without the cost of transportation however they maintained their other means of 'encouraging' slaves so the term slave went obsolete in the most 'civilized' parts of the world and was replaced with words like vassal and surfs as the world continued becoming more 'civilized ' many of the lowest slaves began thinking about posterity and not necessarily wanting them to be slaves of this nature so the 'luxuries' afforded to the highest slaves in the past concubines also began to be afforded to the lower slaves as well and state sponsored rape became comon place as time went on and people continued getting more 'civilized' they started looking around and noticed that the slaves were very little different from their masters and were in fact often blood relatives however luckily for 'civilization's' sake this was around the time that people began exploring the broader world and wha la low and behold they found people who appeared a lot different and less civilized who also lacked sophisticated weapontry so they started uprooting them and affording to them the same 'luxuries' and 'encouragement' that they had been giving to the people they had called vassals and surfs etc as a special bonus they didn't want to dissolution these people with words that might conote even a slight amount of freedom so they started calling them slaves again as time wore on they found new and more creative forms of 'encouragement' that included more creative turtores and scientific proofs done in the presence of slaves of their own drastic inferiorty in an endeavor to disprove science slaves had the audacity to form close knit communities and verbal tradition and lore as well as music that proved that they could be as cultured if not as 'civilized ' as their masters grossly insulted science set out to prove that slaves did not posess the full range of emotion etc that was endowed to their masters these new discoveries enlightened the masters to a new form of population control whereby they continually broke up communities by selling and trading slaves numerous times in their lives eventually a few very cultured but not necessary 'civilized' people began to develope habits of getting exiled from their native countries by daring to commit the intellectual heresy of asserting the possibility that slaves were being abused and that they were very little different from other people appalled and outraged the 'civilized' world began pointing out the numerous advancements and profits that would be utterly impossible without slavery extending the life of this 'civilized' institution for perhaps another hundred years ultimately however the few people who had been getting exiled used their travel visas to their advantage and were able to become the majority of the people in many 'civilized' countries as several wars and rebellions had become popular ways of major movements to express themselves many governments in europe started sympothizing with these growing movements and with the people who were enslaved the western world began abolishing slavery throughout itself and its colonies somehow the southern united states didn't get the memo as it began to realize that it's policy was weakening the minority of americans decided to implement a policy that had a tendacy to work for majorities were voting wasn't quite state sanctioned rebellion not revolution because they sought to prevent change not cause it the north was more revolutionary i e progressive somehow this strategy didn't quite work when the numbers were against them either and the last strong hold of slavery eventually collapsed however time continued to tick and people continued to grow more 'civilized ' they continued to look for more and more ingenious ways to escape work many people found it in machines but some realized that even machines were not as capable as human beings and continued looking for entire groups of people to exploit they have found it in children and in much of the world today child slaves are subject to the exact sorts of treatment that the slaves before them have endured but generally endure the worst at a younger age even before they are capable of manual labor many children become sex slaves the real story is that slavery isn't history it has always been a systematic destruction of human lives that targets whoever has the least ability to protect him herself and it still continues  Racism Goldstein's book Liberalism Microeconomics Sociocultural evolution Goodness and value theory History of the United States Cultural

did some ancient civilizations have technology in advance to what we have today and is our civilization rediscovering some of this lost technology examples i have read about include models of delta wing aircraft found in the tombs of the pharoahs the mahabarata speaking of great battles in the sky with flying machines the lines at nazca in peru only visible from high heights but nazca is flat with no hills there are people who consider it possible that there have been advanced civilizations which somehow were obliterated from the earth and mankind had to begin all over again not an unreasonable theory in my opinion many years ago when my father was a young man he spent a lot of time in the middle east among the archaeological finds of ancient babylonia was a peculiar item that nobody could figure out my father who was an aeronautical engineer believed that it was an electroplating machine naturally his idea was poo pooed the machine was stored in a basement somewhere it was recently rediscovered and the experts now say that it is an electroplating machine they are at a loss to understand how it fit into the scheme of things but if in fact the babylonians were more advanced than is generally believed it is likely that they had other machinery which unfortunately has not survived plato wrote of the hyperboreans who flew in silver bird like contraptions the birds were fed on a special nectar eventually the nectar ran out and the birds flew no more plato was not considered to be a writer of fiction many ancient texts such as parts of the old testament and the epic of gilgamesh suggest that the writers of those works came into contact with things they did not understand and could not explain and some scholars believe these confusing writings may be the result of someone coming into contact with advanced technological creations you may draw your own conclusions from these things i've always believed that one should keep an open mind everything should be carefully considered evidence may be interpreted in different ways lack of evidence does not mean something did not exist or happen but where there is a lack of evidence we must not jump to conclusions i have studied history for more than years and during that time much history has had to be rewritten as new evidence comes to light i think your question is one of the most thought provoking to have appeared on this site keep studying  Unidentified flying object Plato Creationism Origin belief Extraterrestrial hypothesis Historicity of Jesus Socrates Noah's Ark Chronology of the Ancient Near East Book of Mormon Devil God Supernatural Biblical inerrancy History of creationism Flood geology Scientific method Trinity Archaeology Evolution Hipparchus (astronomer) Mythology Troy Religion The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Aristotle Bible Human Atomism Young Earth creationism Philosophy of language Maya civilization Geometry Gospel of Thomas Science Sexual orientation Leo Strauss Library of Alexandria Roswell UFO incident Berossus Nontrinitarianism Immortality Ancient Egypt Elam Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Abduction Phenomenon Urantia Abraham Stone Age History of astrology El (god) Gospel of John Resurrection of Jesus Western philosophy Soul Fermi paradox Bah__'__ Faith and Science Deconstruction Great Pyramid of Giza Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Kabbalah Nazca Lines Aryan invasion theory The Origin of Species Celt Franz Boas Ancient history Solar system Philosophy of mathematics David Hume Sumer Sociocultural evolution Luminiferous aether Anglo-Saxons Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Species New Chronology (Fomenko) Judaism Creation according to Genesis Jacob Neusner Acts of the Apostles Abrahamic religion Yeshu Martin Heidegger Penda of Mercia

do you know that napoleon was only ever beaten by two men on land wellington and whose the other man its strange you know that this other person is hardly ever mentioned in our history no telivision no films about him documentries or anything else but apparently after beating poor old nap the french appreciated him more than we did i know the name of man but not the storey anybody out there know both hi tom of course your right i had to go to the greenwich maritime museum last week on business and while waiting for my colleague on the st floor open display area by the cafe' i read up on admiral william sydney smith it went on further to say that smith was the only other person beside wellington to beat napoleon on land may be they meant the only other englishmen to beat napolean on land do you know anything about admiral smith he was beaten at the battle of aspern essling in by the austrians commanded by archduke charles he was also defeated at the battle of vyazma in by count mikhail andreyevich miloradovich's russian army and at the battle of leipzig in by von blucher also instrumental at waterloo so that's plus wellington and you could even argue that blucher not wellington was the real victor at waterloo since wellington's stratergy was to hold until the prussians arrived which other man were you referring to update smith was quite a character unpopular with his superiors but a very distinguished navel commander served in many different places but his land victory was at the battle of maida in when he attempted to help the spanish re capture naples he was never allowed to follow up on his victory though as he was recalled immediately after the battle and resumed his navel career he was also a diplomatic ambassador of some distinction and he was involved in the aftermath of waterloo he was also a major figure in the cause of abolition of slavery update interestingly wellington never lost a battle in his career though he himself felt waterloo was far from his finest hour  Napoleonic Wars Battle of Waterloo Archduke Charles Napoleon I of France Sidney Smith (admiral) Napoleon's Invasion of Russia Gebhard Leberecht von Bl__cher Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington Peninsular War World War I Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson Battle of Quatre Bras Hundred Days War of the Austrian Succession Battle of Aspern-Essling Battle of Wagram Battle of Ligny History of Austria Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult War of the Spanish Succession John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough Mikhail Andreyevich Miloradovich Battle of Warsaw (1920) French Revolutionary Wars Napoleon III of France Battle of France War of the League of Cambrai Horatio Hornblower Battle of Austerlitz Battle of Leipzig Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II First French Empire Tolstoy French Directory Italian unification Battle of Wavre Scots Guards Alexander Suvorov Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies August von Gneisenau Jacobite Rising History of Germany History of Poland (1795-1918) Andr__ Mass__na The Duke of Wellington's Regiment Military history of France Battle of the Somme (1916) Polish-Soviet War Alexander I of Russia Scots Guards (1805) War of 1812 House of Bourbon Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette Polish-Muscovite War (1605-1618) 29th Regiment of Foot New York Giants Battle of Trafalgar Ravi Shastri Hohenlohe Joseph Radetzky von Radetz Wellington FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan Heinrich Friedrich Karl, Reichsfreiherr vom und zum Stein 33rd Regiment of Foot Isaac Brock Austro-Prussian War Battle of Marengo (1800) Battle of Sedan English Civil War Vyazma Battle of Cape Finisterre (1805) Frederick II of Prussia Otto von Bismarck Edward Gibbon Wakefield 8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot Ulysses S.

in the uk we have been marking the year anniversary of the abolition of slavery it was abolished in britain years before it was abolished in america we have had calls for britain to apologise for the slavery we have even had people in the street chaining themselves up wearing sorry placards britains stance on this is that even though slavery was a terrible evil and a dark period in britains history we cannot apologise for this because there is not one person alive in britain today who has any direct association with the slave trade if that were the case then the germans french normans danes vikings and italians romans would have to apologise to us for invading the uk many years ago what is the american view of this given that the us and uk were basically partners in this appaling trade i would agree with your comments and further state that history shows that there has been slavery in every recorded civilization before the modern ones including all those in africa and asia i have no idea if that is true of the australian aborigines but it applies to everybody else seems to be a very recurring human failing  Slavery Reparations for slavery Abolitionism Black (people) History of slavery in the United States American Civil War History of the United States Blacks and Mormonism African slave trade Trafficking in human beings Compromise of 1850 Homosexuality and Christianity History of Europe Sexual slavery Football African American Middle Ages History of Germany Prostitution History of Denmark Anglo-Saxons History of China Nation of Islam Colonisation Racism West Africa Robert E.

do you like or hate marie antoinette i just wrote a page research paper on why should not have been executed and that she is one of the most misuderstood figures in history just wondering what people's thoughts of her were in the present day thanks thanks your answers are excellent i just wanted to clear up the whole let them eat cake thing the original the french is qu'ils mangent de la brioche it has been suggested that the speaker's intention wasn't as cynical as is generally supposed french law required bakers to sell loaves at fixed prices and fancy loaves had to be sold at the same price as basic breads this was aimed at preventing bakers from selling just the more profitable expensive products the let them eat brioche a form of cake made of flour butter and eggs would have been a sensible suggestion in the face of a flour shortage as it would have allowed the poor to eat what would otherwise have been unaffordable it's rather a mouthful so to speak but if the phrase had been reported as 'let them buy cake at the same price as bread' we might now think better of the french nobility i believe that marie antoinette was near oblivious to the times surrounding her she was infatuated with having the best clothing the best mansions the best everything and she had her husband wrapped around her finger doing everything to please her you combine that with very violent and overly militant army of starving peasants anyone will obviously see why she was killed however i think that her actions though neglecting the interest of the common public did not merit death the militant peasants were much more violent and almost oppressive than were our american forefathers in the american revolution the french sought utter domination and retribution our forefathers sought independance and separation they had swung all the way from a monarchy to a mobocracy marie antoinettes should have been held prisoner and sentenced by a jury of her peers that would have been just to her and would have fulfilled what the french were looking for in their revolution to protect the rights of man  Marie Antoinette French Revolution Microeconomics Capital punishment Cultural Revolution Plame affair British monarchy Democracy Experiment Pizza Freedom of speech Finnish Civil War Sharon Tate Parliament of the United Kingdom Supply and demand Salic law 613 mitzvot Property (ownership right) Aztec Domestic violence Famine Grammatical mood Russian Revolution of 1917 Wal-Mart Chocolate Karl Marx Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Anarchism First Amendment to the United States Constitution Gettysburg Address Theory of conduct IBM PC compatible Libertarian socialism British House of Commons French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Royal Assent Japanese cuisine EastEnders Hiberno-English House of Lords Honor__ Mirabeau Jewish cuisine Divorce Breakfast American Revolution Capitalism Gold standard Pancake Shewbread Free trade Capital accumulation Trademark Head of state Babylonian law Origins of the American Civil War Political correctness Bagel Anne Boleyn Intellectual property Louis XV of France History of the British constitution Jacques-Louis David Communist Romania American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Palestinian National Authority Bengali cuisine Women in Islam Father Divine Grammatical aspect Decapitation Potato Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Socrates History of the Netherlands Dim sum Anarchism in Spain Two Treatises of Government Arab-Israeli conflict Parliament of Canada Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Shit American individualist anarchism Second Sudanese Civil War Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Public good

why did roosevelt gave half of europe to stalin in after wilson created the base for ww with the peace threaty of versailles in the usa and western allies tried to be more practical with its peace threaty in creating an ally in germany instead of an enemy that was good but why in the world was stalin already a threat given the means to be a super power was it the same reason islamic terror states like saudi arabia nd pakistan are supported by bush to make sure we can justify a trillion a year military roosevelt promised stalin already in half of europe against advice of churchill the the allies waited on the rhine for month until the russians made it into berlin that's a great analogy fdr did give away half of europe at yalta in about months before the bomb was operational at potsdam in truman mentioned to stalin that the us had a secret weapon that would bring the pacific war to a close stalin replied use it well comrade indeed we should have used it on the ussr after defeating japan truman should not have honored fdr's agreement the ussr was in ruins and had yet to acquire even the jet airplane we held all the cards and we could've saved eastern europe four decades of misery i believe fdr wanted a swift victory in europe and was willing to go more than half way to satisfy stalin the conspiracy theory that the division was used to start an arms build up to profit the defense industry is plausable again your analogy between fdr and bush both willing to satisfy our enemies at a high price is a good one bush is prudent to assist pakistan but he's too close to saudi arabia for our good  Franklin D.

was jack the ripper a member of the royal family what became of him hmmm why does everyone think that jack was part of the royals it's quite disappointing to see so many people tricked by the foolery the media portrays the theory you are possibly thinking of is the royal masonic conspiracy and is one of many theories the idea of the 'ripper' being of royal blood or had dealings with royals is absurd the idea and basis of the theory for those who do not know is that prince albert victor and the story goes that he impregnated an 'unfortunate' a woman a prostitute this infatuation would bring albert to ruin and the child being bred from royal blood would legally gain heirship to the throne this couldn t be done so the royals along with the freemasons would contrive to rid the truth they employed the royal doctor sir william gull as albert was unable to perform the murders himself due to illness to murder those who knew of the truth the infatuation and the child these just happened to be polly nichols annie chapman liz stride catherine eddowes and mary kelly now with the theory explained let me get to the logical bias of this theory first of all the idea of william gull making his way through the streets of whitechapel alone can be dismissed as that as his stature promotes wouldn t have known about the layouts pf the east end the ripper' however clearly knew whitechapel east end and its slums so why not have sir william travel by carriage with an accomplice by the name of netley logically wouldn t someone have heard the loud noise of wheels rolling on cobblestones in the claustrophobic streets of whitechapel yet no one noticed these sounds or made mention of them at the time of the murders another interesting thing to note is that at the time of dark annie's murder a woman saw miss chapman outside hanbury street the place she was killed negotiating with a man most likely the 'ripper' in case you haven t caught on yet the witness saw one man not two she also saw no carriage would it help if i mentioned that the man she saw didn t match any of the royals okay another thing is that if the theory was correct all of the victims knew each other and had a regular friendship it is a known fact that none of the victims knew each other doesn t this throw the theory into shaky realism so why do so many movies such as the comic book adaptation from hell and the earlier tv miniseries 'jack the ripper' base there story and plot on this theory simply because it has the most dramatic interesting and playful affect they make the theory their movie because of the plot value not for truth and accuracy there was never a grape vine found at the scene of the murders mary kelly did in fact die inspector abberline did not know mary kelly no mention or evidence of laudanum or opium was found if i were you i'd do as much research as you can and find a much more worthy and reliable suspect i found one he goes by the name of francis tumblety tumblety the first and earliest notion of this subject came from one of the police officials on the case a mr littlechild who later wrote a letter describing his thoughts and theory and presenting his idea of who the murderer was this letter was only discovered in the twentieth century when a literature collector and librarian was cleaning out his books ridding of any to be sold he came across the letter and dismissed it as another hoax however when he sent it to a ripper collector and ripperologist stephen evans who later sent it for analysis which found the ink and paper to be authentic this letter later became known as the 'littlechild letter' and is the absolute basis of this theory tumblety himself and american doctor or 'quack' as referred to in the letter was known to be a hater of women a misogynist this man made regular visits to london one of which was in at the time of the murders known to have disguised himself on various occasions now for the interesting parts strong evidence against him was that tumblty collected uteruses preserving them and such annie chapman's uterus was taken more interesting to note is that on the night of the double murders of stride and eddowes upon tumblety's returning to his lodge house the lodging lady discovered that his clothes had visible bloodstains on them he was arrested on november th on charges of gross indecency and indecent assault with force and arms against four men between july th and november these eight charges were euphemisms for homosexual activities tumblety was then charged on suspicion of the whitechapel murders on the th suggested he was free to kill kelly between the th and th tumblety was bailed on november th a hearing was held on november th at the old bailey and the trial postponed until december th tumblety then fled to france under the alias frank townsend on the th and from there took the steamer la bretagne to new york city tumblety fits many requirements of what we now know as the serial killer profile he had a supposed hatred of women and prostitutes the abortion with the prostitute dumas his alleged failed marriage to an ex prostitute his collection of uteri etc tumblety was in london at the time and may indeed have been the infamous batty street lodger he therefore may have had fair knowledge of the east end environs tumblety may have had some anatomical knowledge as inferred by his collection of wombs his medical practice and his short term work with dr lispenard in rochester he was arrested in the midst of the autumn of terror on suspicion of having committed the murders there were no more murders after he fled england on the th november if one counts only the canonical five murders chief inspector littlechild a top name in scotland yard believed him a very likely suspect and he was not alone in his convictions tumblety was fond of using aliases disappearing without a trace and was the subject of police enquiries before his arrest scotland yard and the american police had been in touch numerous times concerning tumblety s flight from france to new york one of the three detectives inspectors assigned to the case was sent to new york at the same time perhaps to pursue tumblety tumblety evaded capture in new york city once again tumblety had the wealth necessary for frequent travel and could afford to change his clothes frequently should they have become bloodstained he was an eccentric but shrewd he had a tendency toward violence at times and his career may have included other offences both at home and abroad several acquaintances of his in america believed it likely that he was the ripper when interviewed in as a sidenote i have to mention that patricia cornwell's sickert theory is rediculous she bakes up many ideas that she forgets to support and base them and make truth out of them do not beleive it anyways i'll leave it here before i make this a ripper book hope it helps in any way cheers  2005 trial of Michael Jackson Constitution of

if the world war i and ii never occured what kind of world would we have today would it be better or worse would we have advanced to information and atomic age today when do you believe the world war would occur what causes it then without the great war there would have been no nazi movement in germany or fascist control in italy so it's safe to say that without the first world war the second would not have taken place at least not as it did i would argue that had the wars not taken place the world would be a much more dangerous place we're assuming that atomic energy jet propulsion and the like were only reached because of the large amount of money and science devoted to military endeavors during the war but the largest breakthroughs came in the pre and post war period science with or without the wars marched on let's not forget that the great age of industrialization was just before the first world war if anything the first world war coupled with the great depression changed the united states from an rural to an increasingly urban society but this war probably slowed economic and industrial development in italy and france and certainly had a devestating effect on the progression of industry in germany and austria hungary not to mention russia fascists would not have won support in italy as the government had so badly bankrupted the country and thrown away the lives of some italian soldiers in a practical stalemate with austria without the fascist movement in italy nazism would not have the effect on a humiliated german public mr hitler would have led a normal life as would have had millions but this assumes that the triggers of world war i would never occur i doubt this if not these triggers elsewhere the growing web of super alliances would have pulled all of europe into a war if it wasn't the serbs to assassinate archduke ferdinand then perhaps a young czech or croat would have five years later perhaps had tsar nicholas remained in power in russia a like minded anarchist would have killed him as they had his grandfather russia was in a state nearing the collapse of the state prior to the war there is no telling how much longer that system would have held fast germany had far outgrown the limits of her borders and vied with great britain for industrial dominance by the turn of the th century without the first world war i think it would be only a matter of time before germany and france warred over the territories lost in the franco prussian war italy and austria would have fought over the south tyrol polish nationalism would have pushed for a new revival as the serbians had americans may have went to war with mexico again with no terrible war in hindsight to bring out a respect for pacifism world war i changed the way we view ourselves and our nations before hitler's obsession with levels of racial purity we evaluated each other by hundreds of races a sicilian race a scottish race and an anglo one without the war would ireland have successfully won its independence or would london have resorted to bloodshed to keep it before the war a country's strength was judged by its population citizens were very much disposable in the case of a national emergency such as a war that was primarily because such a massive loss of life in ridiculously futile trench warfare hadn't created the respect for individual life that we have today among the nations of europe the great war wasn't the first world war several could be called such it was just the one that caused the greatest loss of life i don't think anything could be done to prevent such wars from occuring we'll certainly experience them again for whatever reason whatever just ness is behind the war i think the general trends would have still occured had we not had these great and altering wars perhaps medicine would have lagged in the surgical arena but the constant search for innovation would have propelled it in other areas maybe flight would have still been only a novelty in the s and s but certainly the globalization taking place would have led the aviation industry to realize the potential for travel in the skies a nucleur age maybe not but if not a nucleur weapon definately a bigger and worse weapon that could deter one's enemies i just think the destructive nature's of the wars and in a sense their futility led us into an age where we see war as the last resort rather than as an effective diplomatic tool without the wars we'd see the worldview with our great grandfathers' eyes  Appeasement Austria-Hungary Nazism History of Europe

what was the boston tea party the boston tea party was an act of protest by the american colonists against great britain in which they destroyed many crates of tea bricks on ships in boston harbor the incident which took place on thursday december has been seen as helping to spark the american revolution the stamp act of and the townshend acts of angered colonists regarding british decisions on taxing the colonies despite a lack of representation in the westminster parliament one of the protesters was john hancock in hancock's ship liberty was seized by customs officials and he was charged with smuggling he was defended by john adams and the charges were eventually dropped however hancock later faced several hundred more indictments hancock organized a boycott of tea from china sold by the british east india company whose sales in the colonies then fell from pounds kg to pounds kg by the company had large debts huge stocks of tea in its warehouses and no prospect of selling it because smugglers such as hancock were importing tea without paying import taxes the british government passed the tea act which allowed the east india company to sell tea to the colonies directly and without payment of any customs or duties whatsoever in britain instead paying the much lower american duty this tax break allowed the east india company to sell for lower prices than those offered by the colonial merchants and smugglers american colonists particularly the wealthy smugglers resented this favored treatment of a major company which employed lobbyists and wielded great influence in parliament protests resulted in both philadelphia and new york but it was those in boston that made their mark in history still reeling from the hutchinson letters bostonians suspected the new tea tax was simply another attempt by the british parliament to squash american freedom samuel adams wealthy smugglers and others who had profited from the smuggled tea called for agents and consignees of the east india company tea to abandon their positions consignees who hesitated were terrorized through attacks on their warehouses and even their homes the first of many ships carrying the east india company tea was hms dartmouth arriving in late november a standoff ensued between the port authorities and the sons of liberty samuel adams whipped up the growing crowd by demanding a series of protest meetings coming from both the city and outlying areas thousands attended these meetings every meeting larger than the one before the crowds shouted defiance not only at the british parliament the east india company and hms dartmouth but at governor thomas hutchinson as well who was still struggling to have the tea landed on the night of december the protest meeting held at boston's old south meeting house was the largest yet seen an estimated people were said to have attended on thursday december the evening before the tea was due to be landed the sons of liberty thinly disguised as mohawk indians left the massive protest meeting and headed toward griffin's wharf where lay dartmouth and the newly arrived beaver and eleanour swiftly and efficiently casks of tea were brought up from the hold to the deck reasonable proof that some of the indians were in fact longshoremen the casks were opened and the tea dumped overboard the work lasting well into the night was quick thorough and efficient by dawn lbs tons of tea worth an estimated had been consigned to waters of boston harbor nothing else had been damaged or stolen except a single padlock accidentally broken and anonymously replaced not long thereafter tea washed up on the shores around boston for weeks this act brought criticism from both colonial and british officials for instance benjamin franklin stated that the destroyed tea must be repaid and he offered to repay with his own money the british government responded by closing the port of boston and put in place other laws that were known as the intolerable acts also called the coercive acts or punitive acts however a number of colonists were inspired to carry out similar acts such as the burning of the peggy stewart the boston tea party eventually proved to be one of the many causes that led to the american revolution at the very least the boston tea party and the reaction that followed served to rally support for revolutionaries in the thirteen colonies who were eventually successful in their fight for independence as far as tea drinking itself was concerned many colonists in boston and elsewhere in the country pledged to keep away from the drink as a protest turning instead to balsamic hyperion made from raspberry leaves other herbal infusions and coffee this social protest movement away from tea drinking was not however long lived the boston tea party is known around the world and has been inspirational to other rebels for example erik h erikson records in his book gandhi's truths that when mahatma gandhi met with

what effects did cataclysmic events like the black death hundred years war and great schism have on europe both in the arts and in cultural development each of these events had a different effect if you take the black death when one third of europe's population died it was a political economic and social change today we have the benefit of hindsight we know as fourteenth century people suspected that the mortality caused by the bubonic plague of the black death was the worst demographic disaster in the history of the world we also know that the mortality came to an end in the first outbreak soon after contemporaries could not have known this would happen so far as they were concerned everyone might well die some treated each day as if it were their last moral and sexual codes were broken while the marriage market was revitalised by those who had lost partners in the plague the sustained onslaught of plague on english population and society over a period of more than years inevitably affected society and the economy evidence of the effects can be measured and responses traced not only in social and economic political and religious terms but also in changes in art and architecture the effects of the black death in all these matters were disputed by contemporaries and are still hotly disputed today which makes the topic so endlessly fascinating 'the effects of the black death are still hotly disputed today ' it has been argued that the black death brought about the end of feudalism this was the system of service in return for a grant of land burdening the peasant with many obligations to his lord for example payments were due on entering a land holding upon marriage and death and on many other occasions the black death did not start the process of the commutation substitution of a money payment for labour and other services however there is no doubt that the plague speeded up the process by reducing dramatically the numbers of peasants and artisans by how much commutation accelerated is still a matter of fierce debate government and landlords tried to keep the lid on rising wages and changing social aspirations lords and peasants alike were indicted for taking higher wages in a sumptuary law was brought through parliament this measure decreed not only the quality and colour of cloth that lay people at different levels of society below the nobility should use in their attire but also sought to limit the common diet to basics such legislation could only occur when the government had observed upwardly mobile dress among the lower orders such legislation was virtually impossible to enforce but indicates that among those who survived the plague there was additional wealth from higher wages and from accumulated holdings of lands formerly held by plague victims http www bbc co uk history british middle ages black impact shtml now you need to do same work on the year war and the great schism  Famine Capitalism Unemployment Democracy Feudalism Inflation Microeconomics Wealth Tax History of British society Late Middle Ages Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia Deflation (economics) Minimum wage Gold standard Mercantilism Free trade Appeal Capital accumulation Keynesian economics Divorce History of economic thought Serfdom American individualist anarchism Economics History of Europe Anarchism and capitalism President of Germany Libertarian socialism Conscription Parliament of the United Kingdom Manorialism Economic inequality Affirmative action Labour economics Population history of American indigenous peoples Trade union Labor theory of value Social class Marriage Italian Renaissance Intellectual property Annuity Surplus value Voter turnout Israeli Arab Property (ownership right) Socialist economics Life insurance Bubonic plague Political economy Economy of Russia Social Security debate (United States) Working class History of Russia Bretton Woods system Education in the People's Republic of China Globalization Cancer Abortion debate France in the Middle Ages Russian Revolution of 1905 Marxism Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Origins of the American Civil War New Deal Szlachta History of the United States Peasants' War Euroscepticism Economy of Africa State American Revolution Max Weber Roman Catholic Church Great Depression Medieval demography Constitution of Ireland Parliament Act Middle class Insurance Fathers' rights Conservatism Global warming Renaissance Article One of the United States Constitution

what's the difference between puritans and protestants if i may add there were puritans in england before the pilgrims and the anglican church was calvinistic not lutheran after the schism with the catholic church that was effected by henry viii the protestants in england were divided in different trends with the puritans having a stricter approach on religion and wanting to break off completely from catholicism while anglicanism was at first a sort of catholicism without the pope it then evolved into protestantism but not as strict as that of the puritans the puritans were very strong in the house of commons and often opposed the english monarchs elizabeth i but more especially james i and of course charles i edit there is a major influence of calvin on the anglican church cranmer was a calvinist for instance it may not be calvinistic in the strict sense but it certainly is not lutheran  Puritan Anglicanism Protestant Reformation Protestantism Calvinism Christian denomination Great Apostasy Charles I of England Book of Common Prayer Bishop Divine grace King James Version of the Bible History of the Church of England High church Scotland Baptist Religion in the United Kingdom History of Christianity Catholic Church in Great Britain James II of England Evangelicalism Henry VIII of England British monarchy Separation of church and state Wars of the Three Kingdoms Dissolution of the Monasteries Colonial America James I of England United States religious history Church of England English Civil War 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith Eucharist Catholicism Charles II of England Biblical canon Church of Ireland Catholic Roman Catholic Church Christian Arminianism Edward VI of England Mary, the mother of Jesus Elizabeth I of England Mary I of England Anglican Communion Geneva Bible Unitarianism Ordination of women Counter-Reformation Westminster Confession of Faith Oliver Cromwell Vestments controversy History of Europe Holy Orders Baptism Reformation in Switzerland Lollardy Pacifism 16th century John Foxe Religion in Canada Massachusetts History of Scotland Marian exiles The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism Philip II of Spain Christian anarchism Timeline of Christianity Ecumenical council Pietism Christianity John Henry Cardinal Newman History of the English Bible Huguenot Christian theological controversy Thirty Years' War Unionists (Ireland) John Calvin A Tale of a Tub Transubstantiation History of England Mennonite Restorationism Theology Asceticism Birth control Archbishop of Canterbury Anglican Church of Canada Lord Chancellor William III of England Prime Minister of the United Kingdom John Owen (theologian) Episcopalian church governance Methodism Fundamentalist Christianity

what is position of akbar's religion 'deen e elahi' in present times is there any the din i ilahi was essentially an ethical system prohibiting such sins as lust sensuality slander and pride and enjoining the virtues of piety prudence abstinence and kindness the soul was encouraged to purify itself through yearning for god a tenet of sufism islamic mysticism celibacy was condoned as in catholicism and the slaughter of animals was forbidden as in jainism there were no sacred scriptures or a priestly hierarchy in the din i ilahi in its ritual it borrowed heavily from zoroastrianism making light sun and fire an object of divine worship and reciting as in hinduism the sanskrit names of the sun in practice however the din i ilahi functioned as a personality cult contrived by akbar around his own person members of the religion were handpicked by akbar according to their devotion to him because the emperor styled himself a reformer of islam arriving on earth almost years after the prophet muhammad there was some suggestion that he wished to be acknowledged as a prophet also the ambiguous use of formula prayers common among the sufis such as allahu akbar god is most great or perhaps god is akbar hinted at a divine association as well akbar is recorded by various conflicting sources as having affirmed allegiance to islam and as having broken with islam his religion was generally regarded by his contemporaries as a muslim innovation or a heretical doctrine only two sources from his own time both hostile accuse him of trying to found a new religion the influence and appeal of the din i ilahi were limited and did not survive akbar but they did trigger a strong orthodox reaction in indian islam akbar removed the tax on hindus despite the traditional mandate in islam to tithe non believers and invited scores of religious scholars including hindus jews and christians to debate him personally in his private chambers often late into the night akbar's wives were also of different religious backgrounds each marriage was thus a strategic union that would allow the adherents of india's many faiths to feel that they too were apart of the royal household over time akbar's fascination with religion grew to almost an obsession when he fashioned his own faith called din ilahi din ilahi was an eclectic mix of the other religions akbar had studied during those late night theological debates he borrowed what he saw as the best components of each and blended them into the melange that became din ilahi the new faith however never caught on among the hindus and muslims outside of his court but despite this failure akbar continued to support religious tolerance among his people i don't hear anyactivity of this lovely religion now a days  Love Theology Al-Ghazali Monotheism Sant Mat Vegetarianism History of Buddhism Great Apostasy Hindu philosophy Muslim music Fasting Marriage Satanism Reincarnation Devil Meditation Baptist Mormonism and Christianity Islam in Turkey Mantra New Testament Sin Opus Dei Mahatma Gandhi Religion in Israel Jewish views of religious pluralism Divisions of Islam Sacrifice Church of Christ Bah__'__ Faith Sharia Atheism Prophet Eschatology Soul Angel Filioque clause Persecution of Christians Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Abdul Qadir Jilani History of Hinduism Shi'a Islam United States religious history Philipp Melanchthon Criticism of Islam Apostasy Advaita Vedanta Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Indian caste system Demon Abraham Jainism Mary, the mother of Jesus Icon Protestant Reformation Islam in Indonesia Islam in Bangladesh Islam and anti-Semitism Nation of Islam Baptism

confederate flag i'm curious as to why the confederate flag is equated with slavery and racism slavery only became illegal after the civil war many northern statesmen owned slaves right through the war also the civil war was never fought about slavery look it up it was fought over state's rights and taxation without representation slavery only became an issue towards the end of the war i don't get it any iseas i would tend to agree with you and as an englishman i guess i can be termed as a nuetral party on the subject i don't think the issue is about what the civil war was fought over i just think that many people feel that due to the confederacy's pro slavery stance war or no war the battle flag represents a racist view in the same way as a nazi swastika personally i don't agree i believe that southerners still fly the flag because they still hold a sense of identity and independance and i believe they should have this right just as texas still flies the lonestar flag which represents their status as a republic and the hawaiian flag that still carries a union jack in the upper right canton wasn't the united states founded on among other things a principle of freedom of expression the battle flag should be looked on as an expression of that many a crime has been commited under the british flag and no one thinks twice about it the same with the us flag but for instance many a native american will fly 'old glory' with pride flags represent nations as a whole not the actions of a nation  Confederate States of America Slavery Mexican-American War Flags of the Confederate States of America American Civil War Nazism African American Southern United States History of the United States Democratic Party (United States) United States History of slavery in the United States United States Senate Libertarianism Republican Party (United States) History of the Southern United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Union Jack Flag of the United States Civil rights Abolitionism United States House of Representatives Robert E.

german wwii education this odd question popped into my head a few days ago and now i seriously want to know how do the german's approach thier history in textbooks in reference to world war ii whatever one may say about the germans they are straight people and the allied troops that discovered the camps where shocked so shocked in fact that they created the first tribunal for war crimes in nuremberg in germany till the 's nobody ever talked about hitler but by then the younger generation was asking question and debating what had happened and realized how ugly it had been under mr hitler the greatest con artist probably of all times so i don't know about their history school books but they feel ashamed by what happened especially since it's their parents who made the mistake and the new generation had to suffer they didn't like that and made sure it won't happen again stanley milgram psychologist at yale made an experiment in and wrote a book about it the experiment consisted in punishing students by giving electric shocks for wrong answers the shocks rated from let's say to x x could kill all were volunteer students the punishers went thru the electric shocks so they would know the pain they were inflicting for wrong answers the punished were taught how to scream in pain with each levels of shock since there was no electricity involved and guess what the first student who refused to get higher than the benign punishment and got out of the experiment was a german woman and she told ingram that she had known enough of such stupidity in germany and wasn't ready to start it all over again a colleague of ingram defended the so called torturers at abu ghraib there's an article about this in the n y times dated around wednesday april also there is a difference between historiology and history  Milgram experiment Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Torture The Holocaust World War II Gestapo Schutzstaffel Erich von Manstein Theory of conduct Human rights in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq Scientology beliefs and practices Polish September Campaign God Emperor of Dune Operation Market Garden Cindy Sheehan Unlawful combatant A Course In Miracles Eastern Front (World War II) Continuation War Milton H.

edward viii duke of windsor was he really a nazi sympathizer does the evidence suggest that ex king edward viii was more pro german than pro british in ww there is evidence both ways the duke himself admitted that he admired the germans although he described hitler as a ridiculous figure and he also denied that he was pro nazi after the war the allies were sufficiently worried about him for churchill to threaten him with court martial if he didn't return to british soil in the early part of the war and it is widely held that his governorship of the bahamas was mainly to put him somewhere out of the way roosevelt also ensured that the duke and his wife were under covert surveillance when they visited florida it may be that he favoured fascism over communism and was merely seeking appeasement rather than war after his experiences of the horrors of ww  Edward VIII of the United Kingdom Wallis, Duchess of Windsor Appeasement Abdication Crisis of Edward VIII David Irving Henry VIII of England Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh George V of the United Kingdom Neville Chamberlain World War II Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon Buckingham Palace Continuation War Fatherland (novel) European Theatre of World War II Edward VII of the United Kingdom Carl Eduard, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha Nazism Anne of Great Britain Prince George, Duke of Kent Franklin D.

spanish civil war guernica who was to blame nationalists or condor legion a who decided that guernica was a legitimate military target b was guernica just an experiment in the effectiveness of terror bombing i don't think it was a dry run on terror bombing at all but mainly a raid that did not have proper reconaissance beforehand and one which did not have effective enough leadership to bomb the correct target the bridge behind the town the town was a possible target both for the armaments factory outside the town and for the possible retreat route for republican forces in the area so i believe that the bombing raid was just not given enough time and expertise to carry out properly and as a result many civilian deaths occurred though not the claimed at the time but more like total though planned and carried out by german and italian forces the raid was probably ordered by franco or more likely the nationalist general in the area emilio mola  Bombing of Guernica Spanish Civil War Aerial bombing of cities Terror bombing Gernika-Lumo Luftwaffe Legi__n C__ndor Shock and Awe Guerrilla warfare Siege of Warsaw (1939) Strategic bombing during World War II Guernica (painting) Francisco Franco Aerial warfare Corpo Truppe Volontarie RAF Bomber Command 11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings ETA World War II Second Spanish Republic Terrorism against Israel Korean War Al-Aqsa Intifada Iraq War State terrorism International Brigades Guadalajara offensive Battle of Britain Weapons of mass destruction History of Chechnya Emilio Mola Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia Blitzkrieg Area bombardment Participants in World War II Battle of Berlin (air) Anarchism in Spain Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II European Theatre of World War II Military history of the Soviet Union U.S. invasion of Afghanistan Pablo Picasso Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Lebanese Civil War Bombing of Hamburg in World War II Military description of the Warsaw Uprising History of Spain Iraqi insurgency Battle of France Kosovo War Israel Defense Forces Nuclear weapon 1982 Lebanon War The Blitz Operation Chastise Curtis LeMay Nuclear warfare United States Air Force Terrorism Second Chechen War Operation El Dorado Canyon Anglo-Irish War Chinese Civil War Palestinian National Authority 7 July 2005 London bombings Qibya massacre Greek Civil War Politics of Spain Operation Days of Penitence Civil Air Patrol Suicide bombing Heinkel He 112 Irish Republican Army (1922-1969) 2003 Invasion of Iraq 1948 Arab-Israeli War Bomb Abu Musab al-Zarqawi Fallujah Junkers Battle of the Bulge Asymmetric warfare Palestine Liberation Organization Algerian War of Independence Al-Qaeda Israeli Air Force Royal Navy Battle of El Mazuco Just War theory Madrid Franco-Prussian War Japanese American internment Operation Condor Post-invasion Iraq, 2003___2005 Bombing of Tokyo in World War II

the execution of major andr a blot on washington s reputation george washington's character was is admired on both sides of the atlantic yet washington insisted on hanging major john andr as a spy despite appeals to at least give him a gentleman's death by shooting and despite the fact that the british did not execute american officers for spying so was washington showing a vicious vindictive streak or did he have good reasons for insisting that andr must hang dutch is quite correct about nathan hale of course i apologize but hale was executed summarily no court martial within hours of arrest and in the course of a hunt for saboteurs due to the new york fires of days previously andre was executed after lengthy due process and washington certainly had ample time to reflect on the pros and cons of hanging versus firing squad versus clemency in times of war tough decisions have to be made yes this was a very controversial one but in hindsight perhaps this is also a classic example of how american historians just delight in destroying the reputations of americans while neglecting similar criticisms of other foreign leaders who do identical things truly was the execution of andre' any different at all than the execution of nathan hale has anyone ever bothered to even discuss the disgusting brutality of the british in north and south carolina these are events that are forgotten major john andre' was a spy and was partially responsible for the traitorous acts of benedict arnold it was a time of war yes he deserved to be executed it's one of the risks that a person in his shoes had to undertake the fact that he is honored in britain today is completely irrelevant in they were the enemy and that the enemy would honor one of their own doesn't mean anything to us today it's what enemies do  John Andr__ Plame affair Treason Capital punishment Claudius Smith Benedict Arnold Anne Boleyn Anglo-Irish War Characters in the Southern Victory series Breaker Morant Appeal Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Marie Antoinette Joseph Addison American Revolutionary War Yi Sun-sin Execution by firing squad 2004 Republican National Convention Peleliu Indian rebellion of 1857 Slander and libel Capital punishment in the United Kingdom John Kerry military service controversy Vietnam Veterans Against the War Isaac Brock Robert Novak Hanging Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Days of our Lives George Washington The Death Gate Cycle John Wilkes Booth Red Scare Patrice Lumumba Lodge Committee Provisional Irish Republican Army Humphrey Bogart Capital punishment in the United States President of the United States Ann Coulter English Civil War Tax protester Nathan Hale MI5 Polish September Campaign Hogan's Heroes NKVD Vichy France Speaker of the British House of Commons Saratoga Campaign Espionage Pursuit of Nazi collaborators Acting President of the United States Royal Assent Seppuku Fair Game (Scientology) Fox News New York Giants Anti-Defamation League Conservatism Cicero First Battle of the Atlantic Oliver Cromwell Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Nanking Massacre God Emperor of Dune Separation of powers under the United States Constitution Gordon Drummond Palpatine Fallacy Sydney Riot of 1879 Daniel Morgan Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004 Cleveland Browns James II of England Politics of Hong Kong Louis Riel Same-sex marriage in Canada Abraham Lincoln United States Army Karl Rove Anarchism in Spain Mumia Abu-Jamal Same-sex marriage in the United States Opus Dei Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Codename: Kids Next Door Contract The resolution of the Dreyfus Affair Emma Hale Smith USS Liberty incident Biblical inerrancy

is'nt it about time the turks gave constantinople istambul back to greece i mean come on at the end of the crusades they got a foothold for their religion in the baltic countries and eastern europe on top of that the christians gave back the islamic settlements that they had garrisoned do they still even allow christians to practice their religion in istanbul mertev i know it was first roughly uninhabited then helenized by the macedonians then the romans what i meant with my theory was that since greece is essentially the remnants of the eastern roman empire if it were to be returned the country modernly known as greece should inherit it suggestion the writer who comments that istambul was never greek ought to read some pre islamic history constantinople was greek but they knew it as byzantium it's name from the classicasl period until the reign of constantine the great who changed its name to flatter himself i suppose that next you'll be trying to tell me that jerusalem wasn't jewish learn your history before shooting your mouth off  Byzantine Empire Constantinople Greece __stanbul History of Greek and Roman Egypt Greeks Ottoman Empire Byzantine art Crusade Fall of Constantinople Icon Manuel I Comnenus History of Europe Ancient Greece Thessaloniki Middle Ages Jerusalem History of Greece Western world Persian Empire Jew Iconoclasm Christianity Roman Empire Separation of church and state Second Crusade Balkans Byzantine architecture Jews in the Middle Ages East-West Schism Khazars History of Islam Sephardi Jews Nicaea Roman and Byzantine Greece History of Christianity Emperor Names of the Greeks Ashkenazi Jews History of Modern Greece Bulgarian Orthodox Church Eastern Orthodox Church History of the Middle East Constantine I (emperor) History of Palestine Viking Age Patriarch of Constantinople History of Buddhism Roman Emperor Saint Nicholas Turkic peoples Religious conversion Ottoman Greece Bosniaks Late Antiquity Macedonia (region) Philosophy Palestinian Filioque clause Europe Jewish history Coptic Christianity Kievan Rus' Cyprus Roman Greece Catholicism Theodosius I Trinity History of early Arab Egypt Corinth Russia Serbia Greek language History of the Roman Catholic Church Kemal Atat__rk Kingdom of Jerusalem Religion in Israel Julian calendar Judaism Sabbath History of the First Bulgarian Empire Justinian I Bulgaria History of West Eurasia Vlad III Dracula Ancient Rome Medieval art Paul of Tarsus Hippodrome of Constantinople

when did europe plung into the dark ages im not good in this area of history some say after the fall of the western roman empire others im one of them might say that it was some time after rome conquered most of europe and people abandoned the need to think like the philosophers did severals decades before the romans had many great achievements like their architecture but they got much of that from conquering the etruscans didnt they they didnt add on to many of their current knowledge because they felt they didnt need to and therefore the emire fell to barbarians when and how did europe plung into the dark ages the romans got all their knowledge from the greeks they added very little to that except for invading europe of course the dark ages started with the fall of the roman empire it was crumbling and could not hold all the restive native tribes fed up with the far away ruler who took their money but did nothing to protect them against invaders neither hold back the invading hordes they fell and pandemonium followed everyone trying to carve his piece of kingdom out of what was left and waves after waves of invasions it was a time when a sword was much more important than a pen most of the writings saved during that time were saved by the churches and abbeys and mostly by the arabs who kept them to be rediscovered later by europe in the later middle age however that period did not last a thousand years charlemagne was reknown because he brought peace to europe gave it back a new legal frame and allowed it to rebuild itself and that was in between and the official end of the middle ages in the famous dark ages europe knew a rebirth there were up and downs but it was still a thriving vibrant society just to give you an example look up the cathedrals built during that time visit medieval museums and look at the beautiful jewelry and statuary and those famous crusades in all couldn't have happened if they hadn't had the money for them crusades were hugely expensive and needed a huge logistic there was money in the middle ages merchants had thriving businesses and sent their merchandises all over europe there was a banking system like the one created by the templars to allow people to travel without carrying all that money on their person there were dark side to that of course serfdom is one it ended around the th century to become peasants taxes and duties there were also famines plagues the terrible black plague wars but those happened throughout history however when the renaissance happened they turned back and pointed at the middle ages and said look at those barbarians who didn't venerate the ancient greeks and romans like we do a truly dark age the name stuck it is only lately that people have started to look further than the name a few things made and created during the black ages the screw glasses to read universities bologna paris oxford in salamanca vienna  Middle Ages Byzantine Empire Italian Renaissance History of Europe Crusade Late Middle Ages Western Roman Empire High Middle Ages Jews in the Middle Ages History of Toulouse Sassanid dynasty Ancient Greece History of the Middle East Bologna Celt Renaissance History of Greek and Roman Egypt History of Germany 1270s State Persian Empire History of Rome Bosniaks Reconquista Greco-Bactrian Kingdom Italy in the Middle Ages History of Palestine Black Death History of Greece Rome: Total War Dark Ages Military history of France Chariot racing Western world Military history of the Roman Empire Makuria 1280s Verona France in the Middle Ages Serfdom British monarchy History of Slovakia History of the Netherlands Roman Empire Protestant Reformation Constantinople Roman Britain Roman Republic Jewish history Reims History of Albania Jew Feudalism Sicilian Baroque Parthia Muscovy Ancient warfare Culture of Lithuania Mongol Empire Palermo Eastern Orthodox Church Islamic Golden Age Romania in the Middle Ages History of the World Kievan Rus' Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Academia Avignon Papacy Germanic tribes Hispania Paris History of Russia Holy Roman Empire Byzantine art Ancient Rome Roman law History of Portugal Islamic conquest of South Asia Names of the Greeks Medieval: Total War Gothic architecture History of Finland Aleppo Alans P__cs Novel School of Salamanca

why do they call it history what if its about a female is it herstory herstory is a neologism coined in the late s as part of a feminist critique of conventional historiography in feminist discourse the term refers to history ironically restated as his story written from a feminist perspective emphasizing the role of women or told from a woman's point of view the word history from the ancient greek or istoria meaning a learning or knowing by inquiry is etymologically unrelated to the possessive pronoun his the word has been used in feminist literature since its inception at present herstory is considered an economical way to describe feminist efforts against a male centered canon the oxford english dictionary credits robin morgan with coining the term in her book sisterhood is powerful concerning the feminist organization witch morgan writes the end of herstory kay s hymowitz email respond print when you ask young women today if they think of themselves as feminists more often than not they will pause for a moment then they will answer something like well i believe in equal pay for equal work or yes i do believe women should have choices or of course i believe women should have equal rights http www city journal org html the end of html what is herstory every story has sides if history is written by men than 'herstory' is the other side to that story it would probably include a lot more details and focus on how people felt so as you see feminists have already coined this phrase over years ago and there are many historical feminist journals who write herstory  Feminism Feminist movement Woman Gender-neutral language Andrea Dworkin Philosophy of language God and gender Radical feminism Historiography Gender role Masculism History Jacob Neusner Historian Literature Deconstruction Effeminacy Homophobia Transfeminism Neologism Chinese language Economics Gaze Robin Morgan Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints History of feminism Capitalism Theology Girl Mary Wollstonecraft Creation according to Genesis Bernard Williams Linguistics Sexual orientation Biblical canon Profanity New Testament Dictionary Metaphor History of women in the United States HTML Democracy Finnish language Sociology Internet troll Tarot Ethics Socrates Postmodernity Androgen insensitivity syndrome Heteronormativity Dark Ages Walter J.

i just came up with a theory im not racist but i was thinking what if when they freed the slaves there were some slave owners that didnt tell the slaves and kept them as if nothing happened they had them working and breeding to this day and the slaves just think thats the way it is do you think thats possible if it is what do you think would happen if the slaveholder got caught if the hypothetical slaveowners are careful to never expose their slaves to tv radio flyers with pictures of liberated happy african americans or any other media not to mention people that could raise the slaves' suspicions then possibly and that's a big if then there's the problem of breeding the slaves marriages with relatives which is bound to happen due to the number of people we're talking about which is extremely small usually result in genetically defective offspring according to some this is happening in some religious communities the amish already where inbreeding as a consequence of cousins marrying cousins occurs naturally if the slaves are sickly and weak they can't do much work and are thus unprofitable then it wouldn't make much sense to keep the slaves would it additionally the slaveowners we're talking about have to be able to ensure that nobody finds out and that nobody tattles to the authorities or has any reason to i e if one of them gets angry at the other and wants revenge and if the world ever found out there'd be a huge uproar the african american community among others would demand severe consequences if not a hefty fine for the owner then community service and or prison for many many years frankly none of this is ever likely to happen in the context you have described it's not worth all that trouble to keep slaves for the exclusive purpose of say cotton picking do they still do that by hand though that's not to say that slavery does not exist anymore to this day human rights organizations are battling slavery most identifiable in the form of the sex trade wage slaves or people who work for next to nothing exist in even greater numbers when you think about quality of life and the number of people who are still sunk in the depths of abject poverty and this happens in north america too you realize that there's a lot of problems out there that still need to be fixed we've gotten pretty far but there's still a long way to go  Slavery Theory of conduct Abortion debate American individualist anarchism The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Uncle Tom's Cabin African American Two Treatises of Government Abolitionism Incest Capitalism Social justice Dog Sexual slavery Causality Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theodicy Capital accumulation Microeconomics History of the Southern United States Human rights Southern United States Babylonian law Property (ownership right) Democracy Species Sexual orientation African slave trade Origins of the American Civil War Public-key cryptography Utilitarianism Economy of Africa Inflation Debugging Human sexual behavior Anarchism and capitalism Exploitation Thomas Jefferson Fair use EastEnders Grimke Sisters Free trade Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette Plant breeding African American culture Simone Weil Labor theory of value Polygamy Mixed-breed dog Zambo Crittenden Compromise Marriage Ecology Reproduction Inbreeding Intellectual property African American literature Atlantic slave trade Supply and demand Nation of Islam African American Vernacular English Family name Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Athenian democracy Homosexuality and Christianity Surplus product Colonial America Androgen insensitivity syndrome Human Civil rights Nature versus nurture Minimum wage Racism in the United States Rastafari movement Slave narrative Amish Empire of Brazil Miss Saigon Avenue Q Immigration to the United States Unemployment Gravity Exchange value Morrill tariff Bah__'__ Faith and Science Poker jargon Afro-Latin American Hearing impairment Dred Scott v.

what kind of man was william tecumseh sherman since he used scorched earth policies and total war against the south i get the idea that he was rough and maybe a cold person that understood war could only be grueling for everyone on every side so what kind of person was he i dont have the history channel sherman was full of contradictions he spent a good deal of time in deep south he was president of what became lsu he actually sympathized with the complaints of southerners in their disputes with the federal government he was prone to depression and had to go home for rest to recover his men loved him called him uncle will his campaign to destroy the will to fight by ripping georgia was brutal but very effective his strategy was also brilliant the confederates tried to hold him back by doing such things a blowing up tunnels and bridges on the railroads they thought they had held him out of atlanta by these tactics not long after the southerners arrived in atlanta and they expected some rest they heard a trail whistle one soldier was exasperated he said sherman carries extra tunnels with him he was simply as soldier who was told to win and he did he also saved abraham lincoln in the election of news of the fall of atlanta came just before the election and probably made the difference in the election if lincoln had lost then the presidency would have gone over to the dems who were prepared to negotiate peace  William Tecumseh Sherman Atlanta Campaign Abraham Lincoln Vicksburg Campaign Ulysses S.

what were some of the reasons for the rwanda genocide of well basically i want to know what the reasons for the rwanda genocide were if anyone knows what happened then please help me out your generosity will be rewarded with the best answer being chosen at the end giving you some points i am not sure but i think that the tutsi tribe oppressed the hutu tribe and eventually the hutu rebelled however im not sure so please help the tutsi and the hutus had always a rivalry but this was exacerbated by their coloniser belgium and to a lesser extent germany the belgians saw the tutsis as a superior people and so gave them favourable treatment over the hutu majority many tutsis formed a sort of african aristocracy in the colony the better jobs and education provided for tutsi fostered resentment among the hutus which sparked riots and rebellions in many tutsis were killed and many fled to neighbouring countries the puppet monarchy of rwanda which had a tutsi king was overthrown rwanda was decolonised in and the majority hutus took power playing on the resentment built up over the years the hutu government would routinely use the tutsis as scapegoats and this wasespecially true for the economic crisis that occurred prior to the genocide the hutu government also prevented the tutsis who had fled in from returning to their homeland this tutsi dispora formed a militia the rwanda patriotic front based in neighboring uganda to fight for their right to return president habyarimana used the threat of the rpf as a pretext to harass tutsis as potential collaborators the popular magazine kangura played up this threat as well as producing more anti tutsi racist propaganda the radio station radio t l vision libre des mille collines though nominally independent was materially supported by the government also spewed sensationalist popaganda that help create a charged racist atmosphere all that was needed was a trigger that came when the hutu president of rwanda juv nal habyarimana was assasinated when his private jet was shot down hutus blamed the rpf and this led to a wave of reprisals by hutus troops and paramilitaries this soon gathered pace and became the rwandan genocide  United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda History of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Rom__o Dallaire Burundi Refugee Zaire Africa Pasteur Bizimungu Arusha Accords Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo Consequences of the Rwandan Genocide Initial events of the Rwandan Genocide Democratic Republic of the Congo Agathe Uwilingiyimana Mobutu Sese Seko Butare Analysis of the causes of the Rwandan Genocide Economy of Rwanda Darfur conflict History of Africa Genocides in history Death squad Protais Zigiranyirazo Cyprien Ntaryamira Racism Hamitic Sabena Caste Banyamulenge Laurent-D__sir__ Kabila Kosovo War Politics of Burundi Th__odore Sindikubwabo Ethnic cleansing Criticisms of Christianity Abkhazia Congolese Rally for Democracy Michel Micombero Hotel Rwanda Ruanda-Urundi Th__oneste Bagosora Bibliography of the Rwandan Genocide World War II History of the Netherlands Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda Charles de Gaulle History of Modern Greece Bukavu World War I History of Lithuania International Criminal Court Anti-communism Yugoslavia Francophobia Adolf Hitler Ituri Conflict Belgium Weimar Republic Lord's Resistance Army British Empire History of Sudan Foreign relations of the Democratic Republic of the Congo William Perry Democracy Second Sudanese Civil War Christopher Black Military history of Canada Texas Revolution Vietnam War Economy of Africa History of Poland (1795-1918) Decolonization History of Lebanon Arab-Israeli conflict 2003 Invasion of Iraq Saddam Hussein American Revolution Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Robert Mugabe Kurdish people

how did the japanese treated singaporeans during world war about as well as they treated every one else in the philipines china burma they treated all asians as second class citizens to them and were considered inferior to the japanese they were very arrogant and acted as if they were shoguns and samurai and most were not they just wanted to be and took their racist hate out on these poor peoples all over the pacific isles in the war the japanse soldiers esp officers thought that surrender was a sign of humiliation and disgrace that is was better to kill yourself than to be allowed to be captured by the enemy that was their edict in the war only japanese treated well were germans italians their two axis allies what about the lessons of pearl harbor and sneak attacks what about non geneva convention rules followed how about the bridge over the river kwai how about the invasion of poland and france or germany starting two world wars oh then the invasion of manchuria during that particular time period japanese and german nazis were very cruel and rutheless period this question has nothing to do with today's generations of japanese and germans so before you want to give lessons learn some too hiroshima nagasaki never would have happened if guess what japan had not bombed pearl harbor and then dresden never would have happened for hitler would not have declared war on us he did due to his partnership with japan it was the last thing they wanted was the usa in the war now today everyone wants to look at the usa as the bully well had you all left us alone in the 's as we asked you may have gotten your wish we were dragged into that war just like everyone else we just happened to emerge the victors sure the usa has made its mistakes especially with native americans being part native myself however the contribution the native american code talkers gave to the usa was so huge that the japanese never broke their code sitting bull and jeronimo were not exactly non violent men so what is your point he asked a simple ww history question and you want to turn it into a human rights issue i think you have the wrong category i love going to germany and have dozens of german friends and am even a sensei of shotokan and okinawan kenpo so i certainly have no misgivings towards today's generation of germans and japanese but history cannot forget any of the atrocities be it from the axis or the allies sure the allies had their atrocities too but in comparison to the axis it is barely noticeable until you reach modern days i am part native american but i am usa bread and born no matter my ethnic background  Participants in World War II European Theatre of World War II Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Axis Powers Second Sino-Japanese War Polish September Campaign Pacific War History of Japan Japanese war crimes Military history of the United States Imperial Japanese Navy Timeline of World War II Eastern Front (World War II) Russo-Japanese War Burma Campaign Korean War Attack on Pearl Harbor Battle of the Bulge Aerial bombing of cities War Bombing of Dresden in World War II History of Europe Martial art Joachim von Ribbentrop Allies of World War II Military history of Egypt during World War II Strategic bombing Franklin D.

iran sided with the nazi's in wwll did the palestinians and other arab nations side with the nazi's also within weeks of adolf hitler s ascendance to power mufti of jerusalem haj amin al husseini contacted the german counsel general in palestine with exception of funding anti semitic riots germans rejected the arab s overtures until when adolf eichmann and herbert hagen were sent to palestine to establish a framework to provide husseini with military and financial aid by nazi germany and fascist italy by then the mufti had already proven his anti jewish credentials to the germans by organizing a three year long riots and massacres on april a crowd of arabs stumbled upon jews in the town of jaffa having been incited by mufti spread rumors that zionists were killing muslims the crowd decided to kill three of the jews they met six days later the arab higher committee was created with al husseini presiding over the new body the committee openly endorsed past violence and began organizing future disobedience on may the british colonial authorities warned al husseini against committing illegal acts but did not appear particularly decisive within weeks massive violence broke out by october nearly people were killed and another wounded colonial forces arrested a few pawns and one major leader but took no action against the mufti the new york times reported on june that al husseini had succeeded in convincing experienced high british civil servants that he is working for the government s interests and that it was in the interest of the government that he should also be president of the new arab high committee so that haj amin el husseini enjoys the government s complete confidence as its unofficial adviser on the arab side of the situation the government believes that he and only he is in a position to appease the moslem masses therefore it gives him every support while at the same time playing into his hands http frontpagemag com articles read aspx guid f b e a d b bfe ccf e in fact many arab nationalist leaders from morocco in the west to iraq in the east not only sympathized with the nazis but cooperated with german agents before and during world war the most outstanding arab nazi collaborator however was the leader of the palestinian arabs haj muhammud amin el husseini mufti of jerusalem husseini spent most of world war in the axis domain in europe he conferred officially with mussolini and hitler in a petition he submitted together with other arab leaders husseini urged the fuehrer in the name of the arab nation to recognize the arab right to solve the jewish question in the arab countries later he helped the germans recruit an ss division among the bosnian muslims exerting his influence over their imams later on inspiring them during their service one researcher tells us the mufti worked closely with the nazi machinery responsible for exterminating jews this apparatus was part of the ss headed by his friend himmler husseini made energetic efforts to further the mass murder process by preventing the emigration of jews from the axis domain he petitioned the governments of axis croatia hungary rumania and bulgaria as well as their patrons in germany and italy and neutral turkey to prevent jews from leaving the axis zone towards the end of the war when the axis satellite states of eastern europe could see the looming nazi defeat they made plans to release jews especially children from their territory in return for various considerations or perhaps in order to clear themselves with allied public opinion the mufti hearing of these plans exerted his considerable diplomatic influence among the germans and their satellites to stop these children and adults from escaping their fate under the nazis for instance husseini wrote to the prime minister of bulgaria an axis partner urging bulgaria to send jewish children to poland where they would be under stringent control in his words letter of june these children he asserted presented a degree of danger to bulgaria whether they be kept in bulgaria or be permitted to depart from that country http www freerepublic com focus f news posts the arab embrace of nazism husseini represents the prevalent pro nazi posture among the arab muslim world before during and even after the holocaust the nazi arab connection existed even when adolf hitler first seized power in germany in news of the nazi takeover was welcomed by the arab masses with great enthusiasm as the first congratulatory telegrams hitler received upon being appointed chancellor came from the german consul in jerusalem followed by those from several arab capitals soon afterwards parties that imitated the national socialists were founded in many arab lands like the hisb el qaumi el suri pps or social nationalist party in syria its leader anton sa'ada styled himself the f hrer of the syrian nation and hitler became known as abu ali in egypt his name was muhammed haidar the banner of the pps displayed the swastika on a black white background later a lebanese branch of the pps which still receives its orders from damascus was involved in the assassination of lebanese president pierre gemayel the most influential party that emulated the nazis was young egypt which was founded in october they had storm troopers torch processions http christianactionforisrael org antiholo arabnazi

do you have a favourite poem this is one of mine did you take the trouble to read it elegy written in a country church yard the curfew tolls the knell of parting day the lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea the ploughman homeward plods his weary way and leaves the world to darkness and to me now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight and all the air a solemn stillness holds save where the beetle wheels his droning flight and drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds save that from yonder ivy mantled tower the moping owl does to the moon complain of such as wandering near her secret bower molest her ancient solitary reign beneath those rugged elms that yew tree's shade where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap each in his narrow cell for ever laid the rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep the breezy call of incense breathing morn the swallow twittering from the straw built shed the cock's shrill clarion or the echoing horn no more shall rouse them from their lowly bed for them no more the blazing hearth shall burn or busy housewife ply her evening care no children run to lisp their sire's return or climb his knees the envied kiss to share oft did the harvest to their sickle yield their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke how jocund did they drive their team afield how bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke let not ambition mock their useful toil their homely joys and destiny obscure nor grandeur hear with a disdainful smile the short and simple annals of the poor the boast of heraldry the pomp of power and all that beauty all that wealth e'er gave awaits alike th' inevitable hour the paths of glory lead but to the grave nor you ye proud impute to these the fault if memory o'er their tomb no trophies raise where through the long drawn aisle and fretted vault the pealing anthem swells the note of praise can storied urn or animated bust back to its mansion call the fleeting breath can honour's voice provoke the silent dust or flattery soothe the dull cold ear of death perhaps in this neglected spot is laid some heart once pregnant with celestial fire hands that the rod of empire might have sway'd or waked to ecstasy the living lyre but knowledge to their eyes her ample page rich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll chill penury repress'd their noble rage and froze the genial current of the soul full many a gem of purest ray serene the dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear full many a flower is born to blush unseen and waste its sweetness on the desert air some village hampden that with dauntless breast the little tyrant of his fields withstood some mute inglorious milton here may rest some cromwell guiltless of his country's blood th' applause of list'ning senates to command the threats of pain and ruin to despise to scatter plenty o'er a smiling land and read their history in a nation's eyes their lot forbad nor circumscribed alone their growing virtues but their crimes confined forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne and shut the gates of mercy on mankind the struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide to quench the blushes of ingenuous shame or heap the shrine of luxury and pride with incense kindled at the muse's flame far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife their sober wishes never learn'd to stray along the cool sequester'd vale of life they kept the noiseless tenour of their way yet e'en these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh their name their years spelt by th' unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die for who to dumb forgetfulness a prey this pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd left the warm precincts of the cheerful day nor cast one longing lingering look behind on some fond breast the parting soul relies some pious drops the closing eye requires e'en from the tomb the voice of nature cries e'en in our ashes live their wonted fires for thee who mindful of th' unhonour'd dead dost in these lines their artless tale relate if chance by lonely contemplation led some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate haply some hoary headed swain may say oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn brushing with hasty steps the dews away to meet the sun upon the upland lawn 'there at the foot of yonder nodding beech that wreathes its old fantastic roots so high his listless length at noontide would he stretch and pore upon the brook that babbles by 'hard by yon wood now smiling as in scorn muttering his wayward fancies he would rove now drooping woeful wan like one forlorn or crazed with care or cross'd in hopeless love 'one morn i miss'd him on the custom'd hill along the heath and near his favourite tree another came nor yet beside the rill nor up the lawn nor at the wood was he 'the next with dirges due in sad array slow through the church way path we saw him borne approach and read for thou canst read the lay graved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn ' the epitaph here rests his head upon the lap of earth a youth to fortune and to fame unknown fair science frowned not on his humble birth and melacholy marked him for her own large was his bounty and his soul sincere heaven did a recompense as largely send he gave to misery all he had a tear he gained from heaven 'twas all he wish'd a friend no farther seek his merits to disclose or draw his frailties from their dread abode there they alike in trembling hope repose the bosom of his father and his god by thomas gray yahoo has deleted the short name for cockerel in the poem thanx to everyone for sharing yours and for the stars love lady of shallot not so familiar with ulysses but know it a bit love what i know love j newton's amazing grace ncgal you seen the film yet it wasn't letting me put it in the poetry category for some bizarre reason i did read it but as it was a very long poem it turned into browsing which is not a great way of reading poetry i will have to try it another time i will tell my favorite poem lullaby though it is called wynken blynken and nod and was written by eugene field as a child it was my favorite bedtime story my mother read it quite often so often that she can still quote passages plus years later after i gave up that obsession so that gives you a picture of how important it was to me i have also read it to my preschool children though i must admit it is very out of date for children of this age but the rhythm is a timeless beauty  Torquato

for those who think the civil war was fought over states rights what rights did the southern states want in besides the right to secede the federal government was not nearly as intrusive in the 's as it is today i am looking for specifics rights or laws or issues what federal law about slavery i think most wars are about power and money but i am willing to listen to other points of view if anyone has facts and details the civil war isn't something that just sprung up overnight the first issue that started the crisis over state's rights was the issue of nullification the south felt that individual states should have the power to nullify federal laws that they disagreed with the nullification crisis occured during the presidency of andrew jackson and came to ahead over the tariff of the south lost the battle over nullification and began to feel that their interests were not being represented by the government the abolitionist movement became increasingly important and influential in the north during the s and s which increased the south's feeling of alienation they began to feel that the government would not leave them alone and let them tend to their own lives but was planning on interfering and running everything less government was very important back then and too much government interference in day to day activities was not at all desired immediately were following were a number of crises concerning new states being admitted into the own upsetting the delicate balance between slave and non slave states with the election of lincoln in they felt that they had lost any chance of being allowed to go their own way and live out their lives in the culture and society they had created however all of this feeling was over years in the making and their concern over state's rights was quite a valid concern for that time period  American Civil War History of the United States (1789-1849) Democratic Party (United States) Origins of the American Civil War Nullification Crisis History of slavery in the United States John C.

how did they use pigeons to communicate long ago well a friend told me that a pigeon is only trained to send letters parcels to one area so they only know the way to and fro post office pigeon home and another place but how did they do it anyone can get me a good link or tell me all about it hi mac hull is correct so i can only elaborate in modern times pigeons were placed in the sealed compartments of trucks planes and trains to see if their homing instincts could be fooled no matter what was done the pigeons always found their way back home in ancient times and probably today birds of every type were taught to go between specific destinations by being raised and fed in those two destinations alternately being a bird means your metabolism is real high maintenance and food is the primary reason for and sole means of flight power when a bird of any type learns that there is a reliable source of food to be had in a specific and safe spot they will return to it reliably for the rest of their lives and or for as long as the safe and yummy food continues to present itself why fly away from home well both places are technically home the birds are released at one spot they long for the sky so they usually option to fly to the next destination some birds are duds smile they don't leave the nest literally but those ones usually ended up on the dinner table most birds though will follow their brethren so chicks fledged in one of these arrangements will learn to fly the same route it's a myth to assume that a bird will randomly find someone or someplace to deliver a message some birds do recognize a specific person as their food provider and they will go to them if they see that person in the field this is usually limited to the raptor family though as pigeons are not famous for their eyesight or their learning curve not that raptors are all that smart i kept catching the same owls in the same trap when i was doing cataloging and relocation for the park services the owls were fierce and pissed and it was not an experience you or i would get over quickly but the owls forgot everything within minutes of being released hope this helps  Bird United States Postal Service Falconry Mail Airport Bird migration Dog training Rock Dove Kakapo Seabird Albatross Scientology beliefs and practices Animal communication The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases TGV Global Positioning System Hypoglycemia Gerald Durrell Bird of prey F/A-22 Raptor USS Seadragon (SS-194) Tai shogi Heinkel He 112 Homing pigeon Parachuting Ethernet Peregrine Falcon New York Giants Morse Code Capercaillie B-47 Stratojet Ocean's Twelve Ron Weasley Gliding Surveillance Incarnations of Immortality Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Chicken Link (Legend of Zelda) Anchor Dog Worms weapons and tools Killian documents The Amber Spyglass Hamster The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Biblical inerrancy Computer The Family from One End Street Friends Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act College Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Renewable energy Spacecraft propulsion C plus plus Bird flight Bald Eagle Weight training Public-key cryptography Combine (Half-Life 2) Creatures in Bionicle Post office Kain (Legacy of Kain) Fight Club Redundant array of independent disks Vehicular cycling Richard Feynman Tag Naval mine Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Piccolo Junior Saga The Death Gate Cycle Nutrition Son Gohan Cleveland Browns United Parcel Service New Testament Gmail Snowy Owl Wright brothers Evolutionary creationism USS West Virginia (BB-48) The Amazing Race E-mail Paragliding Windows Vista Broadband Internet access Clyde Pangborn Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!

golden age of india which period is called as 'golden age for india that is only gupta period specialy time of chandagupta ii the gupta dynasty history there were many important monarchical states during the period between the fall of the kushanas and the rise of the guptas such as kingdom of nagas ahicchatra ayodhya kausambi vakatakas mukharis and guptas east panjab uttar pradesh and rajasthan were ruled by the yahudeyas who were quite powerful licchavis were the powerful republic at that time this republic existed even during the life time of buddha a matrimonial alliance with a licchavi princess kumaradevi brought strength and prestige to chadragupta i the original of the gupta dynasty is however still in obscurity too many conflicting representations in the available dramas and inscriptions makes it further tough unless and until a solid evidence is found same holds good to the original territory of the guptas some writers are under the opinion that magadha was their homeland but some views that it is not sri gupta ad the poona copper inscription of prabhavati gupta describes that sri gupta as the adhiraja of gupta dynasty portion of northern or central bengal might have been the home of guptas then though no much evidence is available from the available records it is understood that sri gupta could be the first king of the gupta lineage ghatotkacha ad ghatotkacha became the successor of sri gupta in two records of prabhavati gupta daughter of chandragupta ii ghatotkacha is described as the gupta king neither much evidence is found to clearly regard ghatotkacha as the first king nor much is known about him chandragupta ad the title maharajadiraja itself explains that chandragupta i was a powerful gupta king the conquests might have been the strong reasons for the title the coins of chandragupta i associates licchavis with his sovereignty with the results of marriage of chandragupta i with kumaradevi the gupta dynasty came into prominence it is certain now that chandragupta was raised by his licchavi connection from the rank of local chief to a dignity that justified him to assume the title maharajadiraja samudragupta parakramanka ad samudragupta was the son of chandragupta i and mahadevi kumaradevi the grandson of ghatotkacha he was considered to be worthy for succession and hence was put on the throne by his father he gained the name indian napoleon due to his conquests in many directions and in various kinds the empire of samudragupta wa far the greatest that had seen in india since ashoka's days after completion of conquests samudragupta performed horse sacrifice and coins representing asvamedha yagna were distributed to brahmins his coins gives us a lot of useful information about him there are as many as eight different types like archer battle axe tiger slayer kacha asvamedha lyrist etc some of his coins such as battle axe and archer types shows the advancement of the indianization of the gupta coinage rama gupta ad though no inscriptions or coins explains rama gupta well there are materials such as natyadarpan and the historical drama devichandraguptam which described rama gupta as son and successor of samudragupta according to devichandraguptam in shringararupakam rama gupta sustains a humiliating defeat at the hands of saka king in order to secure the security of his people rama gupta agrees to surrender his queen to the sakas which provokes his brother chandragupta ii chandragupta ii in disguise of queen dhruvadevi enters enemies camp and kills the saka king to restore the huge empire queen and the dynasty this incident raises chandragupta in the eyes of people and dhruvadevi the conduct of rama gupta gets betrayed by the brother and rama gupta kills him and sits on the throne he then marries the widow of his brother chandragupta ii ad with the aid of mathura and bilsad pillar inscriptions it is clear that chandragupta ruled between ad until ad chandragupta is also known as vikramaditya narendrachandra simhachandra narendra simha vikrama devaraja devagupta and devasri he was selected by his father as a successor to the throne he had two wives with kuveranga of naga family he was blessed with a daughter prabhadevi prabhadevi was later married to the vakataka king rudrasena ii prabhadevi was the de facto ruler of vakataka kingdom between and ad the geographical location of the vakataka kingdom allowed chandragupta to take an opportunity to crush western kshatraps once for all the greatest of his military achievements was his advance to the arabian sea and the subjugation of the peninsula of saurashtra kathiawar the annexation of saurashtra and malwa brought him huge wealth and soon made him to open up trade through sea ports it is believed that pataliputra continued to be the capital of his huge empire chandragupta ii was a strong and well qualified ruler he was a staunch vaishnava and was tolerant to other sects too according to the chinese visitor of the time fahien the city of gaya was completely empty and desolate the holy places of bodhgaya was surrounded by jungle kapilavastu and kusinagara were waste except for ashoka's palace near sanchi stupa which was still in existence this shows that the hinduism was predominant during gupta rule kumaragupta ad like his father kumaragupta i ruled for forty years he had two sons purugupta son of anantadevi and skandagupta son of devaki kumaragupta i was known by several names such as shri mahendra ajita mahendra sima mahendra asvamedha mahendra mahendra karma mahendra kalpa shri mahendra simha mahendra kumar mahendra aditya etc it is stated that he ruled the whole earth bounded on the north by sumeru and kailasa mountains the vindhya forests on the south and two oceans on the east and west people worshipped different gods and goddesses and the religion tolerance was seen stronger his administration and personality kept the entire kingdom intact and integrated for forty years the repulsion of hunas immediate after his death proves the integrity of his subjects skandagupta ad succession after kumaragupta is a matter of uncertainty different theories propose different lines of thoughts on succession by skandagupta purugupta budhagupta an kumaragupta ii bhitari pillar inscription mentions most about skandagupta and the huna wars the kahaum pillar inscription boasts on skanda's achievements he is stated to have slain hundreds of kings and equated to indra at zenith of his power he ruled entire northern indian from kathiawar in the west to bengal in the east the empire included saurashtra gujarat and malwa too skanda followed a policy of religion toleration he himself was a bhagavatha but did not interfere with the religion of his officers or subjects puru gupta ad with the death of skandagupta gupta empire began to decline his brother purugupta appears to have been the immediate successor to skanda gupta purugupta was the son of kumaragupta i by his queen ananthadevi and was old by the time he ascended the throne a short rule of years probably explains why so narasimhagupta baladitya ad nothing much is known on baladitya but it is certain that he was the son of purugupta by the queen shri vinayadevi kumaragupta ii ad narasimha baladitya was succeeded by his sonkumaragupta ii kramaditya the rule seems to have ended about the year ad it is obvious that kumaragupta ii narasimha baladitya and purugupta altogether could rule only for about ten years budha gupta ad budha gupta ruled for nearly years from ad to ad a large number of inscriptions refer to budha gupta from the inscriptions we understand that his empire was still intact according to the life of hiuen tsang budha gupta was succeeded by tathagata gupta kumaragupta iii probably krishnagupta and harshagupta succeeded budhagupta in ruling the empire budhagupta and harshagupta was succeeded by jivitagupta i kumaragupta iii succeeded jivitagupta i but soon had to facemany difficulties mukharis became powerful gowdas started revolting in west bengal king of andhras were another threat to him somehow he claimed victories over them the next successor damodaragupta mahasenagupta madhavagupta and devagupta ii reigned with much great difficulties all what we know about later guptas is the name of rulers like adityasena devagupta iii and the last king jivagupta iii gowdas destroyed the fame of guptas though many inscriptions talk about guptas rule even during th to th century ad it is true that only petty kings of gupta family continued ruling part of the original empire that they could retain

what was the view of the death penalty in the th century in brief the death penalty was commonly used for people who were a substantial threat to society murderers and rapists could count on it horse thieves and rustlers could also count on it in many communities however minor crimes like gambling whoring and such were more often punished with exile not killing they ran them out of town after the railroads reached towns it was said they ran them out of town on a rail because the town bought them a railroad ticket and made sure they got on the train local communities were not set up to have long term prisoners if they couldn't sentence them for less than a week the solution was either run them out of town or kill them depending on the severity of their crime the decline of capital punishment came along with the establishment of state and federal prisons the decline of exile as a punishment came about because towns could no longer just export their problems to their neighbors  Capital punishment Life imprisonment Rape Capital punishment in the United States Capital punishment in the United Kingdom Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution Crime in Australia Roper v.

most ancient archaeological site in india the stone age in india begins with the paleolithic and terminates after the mesolithic middle stone age the paleolithic dates back to the geological era of middle pleistocene paleolithic sites abound in peninsular india and are found more prominently at pallavaram in tamil nadu hunsgi in karnataka kuliana in orissa didwana in rajasthan and bhimbetka in madhya pradesh the mesolithic sites far outnumber the paleolithic ones and are located all over the country synonymous with the advanced hunting fishing and food gathering economy mesolithic usually corresponds to the immediate post pleistocene or early holocene about years ago period the beginning of the disposal of dead and the formation of band level society also characterised this period the early rock paintings depicting hunting and ritual scenes are the period s most remarkable legacies the neolithic chalcolithic age the neolithic chalcolithic phase that followed the mesolithic culture was marked by remarkable progress in the techniques of agriculture and domestication of animals thus laying down a firm foundation for india s rural life wattle dab houses mushroomed over several village settlements during the rd and nd millennium b c inamgaon and walki in maharashtra navdatoli in madhya pradesh ahar balathal and gilund in eastern rajasthan budhihal sangankalur maski and brahmagiri in karnataka utnur in western andhra pradesh golbai in orissa pandu rajar dhibi in west bengal chirand in bihar and burzoham in kashmir have revealed a distinct neolithic chalcolithic phase in india the ongoing excavation at balathal near udaipur in rajasthan has surprisingly yielded the earliest known village in india so far radiocarbon dated b c indus valley civilisation while the neolithic chalcolithic sites of india were not matured enough to be labelled as civilisations around the same time over the indus and ghaggar river valleys in northwest india bordering pakistan and in kutch and saurashtra in gujarat flourished a civilisation that is referred to today as the indusvalley civilisation it extended over an area that was much larger than any of the other civilisations that were its contemporaries some well known indus cities in india include dholavira kalibangan lothal surkotda and rakhigari its marvelous planning the most outstanding feature of the indus valley civilisation was its unique town planning with well regulated streets oriented almost invariably along the cardinal directions the houses were made of either mud bricks or kiln fired bricks of regulated sizes an average house consisted of a courtyard around which rooms were constructed to live in and carry out various household activities the construction of towns an indus town consisted of two parts the citadel and the lower town each with their respective fortifications the citadel had monumental buildings like the great bath the granary and the assembly hall evidence of civilized economy agro pastoralism was the mainstay of the civilisation s economy besides coastal communities also exploited a wide range of marine life for their subsistence ample evidence to this effect has been found in kuntasi in gujarat the indus valley civilisation was also very well versed in the craft of bead making ceramics and shell its flourishing trade the indus valley civilisation was known for its trade both domestic and foreign its system of weights and measures its written script and religious beliefs the civilisation declined by b c and led to the growth of several fragmented settlements in north india in the upper plains of the river ganges collectively termed as the painted gray ware culture some of its important settlements have been excavated at ahichchatra hastinapura both in western uttar pradesh and purana quila in delhi the excavations were aimed at identifying areas mentioned in the great hindu epics the mahabharata and the ramayana megalithic phase at the time of the painted gray ware settlements in the north south india saw the predominance of the megalithic culture simple monoliths a cluster of stone circles or dolmens usually characterise a megalithic site agro pastoral communities erected these either to commemorate a burial or to depict an actual burial site in kerala the megaliths are mushroom shaped stone objects known as topikal or kodekal excavations conducted in a number of megalithic sites have revealed a substantial amount of artifacts indicative of a pastoral economy warfare and rudimentary trade and exchange between settlements some prominent megalithic sites of south india are found at brahmagiri maski and rajan kalur in karnataka bhagimari in maharashtraand the north and south arcot districts in tamil nadu interestingly the megalithic tradition has continued in certain tribal areas especially among the gadabas of orissa gonds of bastar and the bodosof northeast india who still erect menhirs monoliths as commemorative

bandra is a possible corrupt pronunciation of 'vandre' a marathi name there are other views on the origin of the name that it is derived from a portuguese princess for one and another more plausible one that it is a corruption of bandar gah in hindi which means port vandre in marathi and bandar in hindi both mean port and come from the same sanskrit root word this area was under shilahar dynasty in th century it is referred to as bandora as seen on gravestones in the cemetry of st andrew's church and in the writings of mountstuart elphinstone of the english east india company which describe

sion in the jesuits built a college and a church in bandra which was called st anne's college or 'santa anna' church in the mid th century the traveller john fryer records that the jesuit church which stood near the sea shore was still in use the portuguese built several churches in bandra including the famous st andrew's church which has the distinctive portuguese style facade bandra has the unique distinction of having the most roman catholic churches anywhere in the world six churches with their own separate parishes and also the world famous basilica of our lady of the mount affiliated to the parish of st andrew's bandra in when the kunbi farmers migrated to this island from bombay because the fish manure they used was banned they founded st andrew's church which is still standing

herculaneum and pompeii which is greater and which is more richer why herculaneum is not famous as pompeii do and why people always mention about pompeii and seldom talk about herculaneum as the two city suffer the same disaster i don't know i think it is because it was discovered later by archeologists with vesuvius brooding on the horizon any visit to the bay of naples area should include a visit to herculaneum it is unjustly less famous than its bigger brother pompeii as the state of preservation of the buildings are generally much superior it was lost to sight during the same series of eruptions that destroyed pompeii but was possibly destroyed by a pyroclastic flow as much of the timber has survived in a charred condition giving a much better idea of what a roman town may have looked like  Mount Vesuvius Naples Pliny the Elder Volcano Pliny the Younger Lost city Roman villa Roman Empire Johann Joachim Winckelmann Library of Alexandria Titus Roman Republic Campania 1st century Mount Pinatubo Pompeii worm Up Pompeii Antique furniture Herculaneum, Missouri Mount St. Helens Natural disaster 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Graffiti Neoclassicism Johannes Wiedewelt Jacques-Louis David Mount Etna Decade Volcanoes Santorini Timeline of ancient Rome Sorrento, Italy Vulgar Latin Heinrich Schliemann Pizza Epicurus Pan (mythology) Rail gauge Mount Tambora Mount Rainier Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Blackadder Protoss Tsunami Villa of the Papyri Crater Lake National Park Hipparchus (astronomer) Mount Mazama Maritime archaeology Zerg Erotic art Tile Nola StarCraft universe Disaster StarCraft Episode VI Fayum mummy portraits USS The Sullivans (DD-537) Fresco Lisbon Sicilian Baroque Marcus Licinius Crassus History of Western philosophy Mount Merapi Manawatu-Wanganui Tuff Lava Neoclassical architecture Minoan civilization Magdeburg Lake Nyos Ancient history USS Augusta (CA-31) The Doctor Dances Bad Wolf Theory of conduct Long Valley Caldera Great Lakes Mount Unzen Cinema of Italy Igneous rock Mount Adams Gladius Religion Sarah Kerrigan Martyrology StarCraft Episode III Volcanic ash Debrecen StarCraft storyline Epigram Chersonesos Italian Renaissance Osijek Torquay United F.C.

why do conservatives get blamed for slavery really i can't believe the rap conservatives take for this everything i have ever read and have been taught tells me that the democrats were the main slaveholders republicans stemmed from the whig party right before the civil war and the abolitionists for crying out loud abe lincoln was a republican and he certainly never held any slaves and felt it was a scourge on our society frederick douglas was invited to the white house when lincoln was president to discuss the problems the blacks faced and did everything he could to help them douglas said he was very nervous to go the first time he was invited because he didn't know the reception he would receive because at that time in history the blacks were considered inferior to whites in a majority of society but when he went he said he could not believe the warm welcome he recieved from lincoln and said he believed lincoln was one of the nicest people he had ever met who treated him with respect and honor most of the republicans at that time wanted slavery abolished in the sixties civil rights movement you still could not go down south and be served in a restaurant if you were black and the south was mostly democrat at that time what is the other side of the story that i am not hearing i'm not sure conservatives get hit as hard as whites in general regardless of their political views the thing that you have to remember is that both political parties have evolved over the years i'm not sure why slavery is still an issue and more over i'm not sure why people blacks especially are seeking revenge for it while slavery is an atrocity in and of itself i feel no personal responsibility for any of it and i'm about as white as they come do i condone slavery no am i glad that its over absolutely nevertheless i've never done anything to anyone slavery nor any other sort of racist actions and therefore i don't believe i should have to apologize for nor should i have to explain the actions of those who lived hundereds of years ago i realize that the hardcore black leftists like to pin everything bad on republicans simply because the republican party has become the quasi embodiement of the 'white devil' but at the sametime i think thats why nobody takes them seriously now its one thing to have black activists and leaders educating and raising awareness about those unbelievably horrible atrocities that took place hundered years ago which is fine understanding the mistakes of history is the best way to prevent them from happening again furthermore those days of old were not only a defining time for black history but american history itself it really proved that we are a superior country because we did in fact not only realize that slavery is wrong but we indeed took the steps necessary to end it lastly we have to understand that the 'white devils' werent soley responsible for slavery we also have to note the african leaders at the time who sold their own people to slaver traders but for some reason that part of history always gets left by the wayside people like to make it seem like george washington blew over to africa single handedly abducted thousands of people and brought them back to america with absolutely no help from the african people give me a god d mn break in short the whole finger pointing at whites and conservatives for slavery is really just a bunch of bullocks most intelligent people that i deal with are progressive thinking conservatives who think that the entire religious right and republican party is just as corrupt if not more so than the meandering liberals it just goes to prove that broad generalization strikes again j  Slavery Democratic Party (United States) Abraham Lincoln Republican Party (United States) Nation of Islam Southern United States Origins of the American Civil War Plame affair Reparations for slavery African American Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Racism History of slavery in the United States Religious Society of Friends Supreme Court of the United States Dred Scott v.

were there guns and or fireworks in the th century help me settle a debate my daughters and i were watching sleeping beauty when my year old said that it was stupid for them to depict fireworks in the movie because they weren't invented yet i think that is incorrect which is it when was the gun and or fireworks invented before during or after the th century thanks guns are a bit later but fireworks were around check out this excerpt on the history of fireworks fireworks originated in china some years ago the most prevalent legend has it that fireworks were discovered or invented by accident by a chinese cook working in a field kitchen who happened to mix charcoal sulphur and saltpeter all commonly found in the kitchen in those days the mixture burned and when compressed in an enclosure a bamboo tube the mixture exploded some sources say that the discovery of fireworks occurred about years ago and other sources place the discovery sometime during the th century during the song dynasty although this could be confusion between the discovery of gunpowder by the cook and the invention of the firecracker some sources suggest that fireworks may have originated in india but in the october online edition of the hindu an indian national newspaper the chinese are credited with the discovery of gunpowder a chinese monk named li tian who lived near the city of liu yang in hunan province is credited with the invention of firecrackers about years ago the chinese people celebrate the invention of the firecracker every april by offering sacrifices to li tian during the song dynasty the local people established a temple to worship li tian  Black powder Fireworks Diwali China Ice cream Chinese New Year Tofu Silk Road Xuanzang Gunpowder Taoism Mid-Autumn Festival Chinese language Chinese tea Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period Steel Greco-Bactrian Kingdom Confucianism Chinese in Singapore Henan T___t Yuezhi Tea Paper Greco-Buddhist art Nakhi Gupta Empire Chu-Han contention South India Charles Goodyear Hand grenade Personages of the Three Kingdoms Green tea Xiang Yu Buddhist art Empress Wu Culture of China Sulfur Daylight saving time Guan Yu History of Buddhism Southeast Asia Beijing Qiang Cannon Buddhism in China History of India Giant Panda Firework Gunpowder Plot Silk Road transmission of Buddhism Dragon boat End of Han Dynasty I Ching Internal combustion engine I-Kuan Tao New Year's Eve Bodhidharma Standard Mandarin China at the 2004 Summer Olympics History of tea in China Culture of Korea Mao Zedong Buddhism in Bangladesh Fire extinguisher Zhuang Chiang Mai Rocket fuel Xiongnu Kushan Empire Cartridge (firearms) Rocket Emperor Huan of Han Hmong Liu Bei History of Vietnam Emperor Guangwu of Han Hindu Indo-Greek Kingdom Zhang Qian Chinese calendar Hunan Babri Mosque Zhoushan Shanghai Bonfires of Saint John Changsha Stove Taiwanese aborigines History of China Joseon Dynasty Jammu The Legend of the Condor Heroes Qin Dynasty

why is julius ceasar such a critical figure in roman history discuss his accomplishments actually the 'accomplishments' of julius ceasar were few it was his 'private life' his 'affair' with cleopatra and his 'assassination' by brutus that makes him so 'famous' or infamous 'life' in rome was actually very 'set' by the 'powers that be' from before him and perhaps the 'biggest accomplishment' of his reign was the fact that he was so 'do nothing' that it was his 'assassination' that changed the romans whether for 'good' or for 'bad' is up to the people who 'came after' and who will 'come after' into our 'future history' because good caesar or bad caesar julius is the 'best known' of all of them and he really 'didn't do much' as a ruler at all  Julius Caesar Caesar Augustus Julius Caesar (play) Roman Kingdom Roman Emperor Roman Republic Cleopatra VII of Egypt Marcus Junius Brutus Asterix Emperor Ancient Rome Second Triumvirate 44 BC Timeline of ancient Rome Ptolemaic dynasty Caligula Tiberius Cato the Younger Praetorian Guard Pompey Imperator Vespasian Western Roman Empire 1st century BC History of Greek and Roman Egypt Roman calendar Claudius Roman Republican civil wars Cleopatra (film) Antony and Cleopatra Pothinus Conspiracy Rome: Total War Roman Empire Military history of the Roman Empire Lucius Julius Caesar Henry VIII of England John Wilkes Booth Capitoline Hill Tacitus Battle of Alesia Sextus Pompeius Marius Assassination Library of Alexandria Livia Asterix and Cleopatra Loeb Classical Library Nero Roman Emperor (Late Empire) Battle of Munda Philip the Arab Eunuch House of Julii Gaius Cassius Longinus Roman Senate Shakespeare on screen Germanicus Atrebates Hispania Herod the Great Year of the Four Emperors Julia Caesaris Roman dictator Julius Caesar Scaliger Ptolemy XIII of Egypt Masters of Rome Paul of Tarsus Dacia Roman conquest of Britain Romulus Augustus Julian calendar Battle of Pharsalus Parthia Women in Rome Imperial cult Pomerium Rome (TV series) Pontifex Maximus Roman Britain Eponym Alexandria Cassivellaunus Constantine I (emperor) Pharnaces II of Pontus Dictator Fulvia Isis Roman Navy Catuvellauni President for Life Diocletian Byzantine Empire Consul Virgil

why do the americans not acknowledge that they committed genocide the systematic destruction of culture and religion and widespread premeditated murder of american indian peoples by the united states and yes i realise other countries did the same before them but on a much smaller scale has no other description than genocide or holocaust since it resulted in the near extinction of an entire race of indiginous people germany educates its people about the crimes commited by their nation yet the united states does not nor does it without very lengthy legal process compensate the families of those wronged why do the american government and people still believe in manifest destiny or do they just feel they are beyond reproach or maybe they just like to pretend it didnt happen loryntoo thankyou for the history lesson i have a degree in american indian studies and i'll think you'll find that the indians were told to give up there land or be deemed hostile the ones that gave up were rounded up and put onto crappy land and told to farm the ones that didnt were fired upon on sight who wouldnt fight for their land if it was being stolen loryntoo also most of you are misunderstanding or avoiding the main part of the question i'm not disputing that it is taught to varying degrees in schools or that americans are aware of the issue my point is that america does not seem to recognignise it as genocide and so far not all but most of you aren't either is it or isnt it and if it is why are you as a nation with a high jewish population so unwilling to admit that it was genocide they don't because of the laws here there is no statute of limitations on murder if the govt actually admitted to murdering any indian it would open the flood gates to prosecution and yes they can prosecute the govt as an entity weather or not the individual that signed the policy is dead or not because it's the office of the president that signs not the man this is also the reason the usa will never join the world court they would be charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity edit i could be wrong but i think he means america as in the assholes in dc running the show  Genocide Murder Population transfer Population history of American indigenous peoples United States International Criminal Court Hate crime Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Capital punishment Racism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Jew Politics of the United States The Holocaust Appeal Japanese war crimes Plame affair Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Holocaust denial Bangladesh Liberation War Theory of conduct Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Nuremberg Trials Unlawful combatant Human sexual behavior Srebrenica massacre Government of India Slobodan Milo__evi__ Bombing of Dresden in World War II Contract International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement Human rights Anti-Defamation League Ward Churchill Political subdivisions of New York State Supernatural Israeli settlement Benny Morris Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Polygamy European Union American Revolution Education World War II Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Mein Kampf College John Lott Jewish principles of faith Lawyer Reparations for slavery Ethics Accession of Turkey to the European Union Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Holodomor Education in the United States Israel Gun politics in the United States Patent Anschluss International Court of Justice Serial killer Evil Extradition State Treaty Abortion debate Stolen Generation Genocides in history Public domain Law Indigenous peoples Separation of church and state Due process Israeli Arab Jean Kambanda Schutzstaffel Zionism and racism First Amendment to the United States Constitution Conspiracy Beltway sniper attacks Sabra and Shatila massacre Manifest Destiny Age of consent Criminal law Patriotism

common complication of childbirth in the early 's another research question as it seems my skills are still lacking today i need to know some common complications of childbirth in the early 's that would lead to maternal mortality again could you please provide links to verifiable sources thank you so much for your help first the political side of childbirth medicalization has its benefits but it also has created many problems for women during birth in the hospital much of the dignity was taken from childbirth women also cannot control their own health and body in a hospital women are shaved and sliced for reasons that have no real support for instance episiotomies are often performed so that a woman won't tear during birth it's like burning down your own house so someone else won't in studies women heal better and faster without episiotomies have less pain during sex months later and have more comfort in the few weeks after childbirth they are also covered up and draped so that the doctor would only see a vagina instead of the entire woman pregnant women became subjects to the patriarchal world that we live in where medicine rules over nature traditionally women have given birth squatting or standing due to the medicalization of childbirth women now are forced to give birth laying down with their feet in the air a position made popular by a rich and powerful man years ago because he wanted to stand behind a curtain and get a good look at his wife birthing their child this position allows the doctor to stand or sit without having to put much physical effort into the birth by bending his her back but the position actually makes going through the labor and childbirth more difficult for women she must push her baby in an uphill fashion going against gravity in the hospital women are usually attached to machines and monitors this is a sort of bondage for women her body is working extremely hard and she is stuck to the bed in what could be an uncomfortable position for her when women have the chance they usually prefer to walk move bathe and bend during labor and birth the reason that so many women today still have children in hospitals is because there is a lack of options the idea that a woman won't be able to take the pain and that our culture does not support home births there are fewer midwives available today and most of us still think that all births should be under a doctor's close watch in actuality midwives are just as reliable if not more for low risk women let me repeat for low risk women they spend an average of hours with women before the actual delivery while doctors spend an average of midwives are about to of the cost of doctors they perform less c sections episiotomies and other surgeries hollywood portrays only the most painful and difficult of childbirth and therefore women begin to think that they will not be able to take the pain the pain may be intense but many women today want to be alert enough to remember their delivery with the ability to sit in warm water and move around more women can deliver their children without drugs the medicalization of pregnancy is only one of the many aspects of women's health that has been turned into an illness and something that a woman can no longer control http www everything com index pl node id mostly women died from septic causes the major causes of maternal death are bacterial infection toxemia obstetrical hemorrhage ectopic pregnancy puerperal sepsis amniotic fluid embolus the substitution of doctors for midwives and of hospital delivery for home delivery did little in themselves to reduce mortality rates for mothers it was not until around when antibiotics and transfusions were introduced that a sharp reduction in the maternal mortality rate occurred in maternal mortality was about times higher than it is today and not much lower than it had been in the mid nineteenth century by world war ii however death in childbirth had been cut to its present low level http www digitalhistory uh edu historyonline childbirth cfm here you have numbers http www beverlylahayeinstitute org images content dd pdf  Urinary incontinence Pneumonia Herpes simplex virus Abortion debate Cytomegalovirus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Traumatic brain injury Publicly funded medicine Chronic fatigue syndrome Gonorrhoea Psoriasis Abortion in the United States Intravenous therapy Medical analysis of circumcision Epidural Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder In vitro fertilisation Cancer Menstrual cup Fecal incontinence Prenatal care Oral sex Fertility awareness Acute respiratory distress syndrome Androgen insensitivity syndrome Stomach cancer Menstrual cycle Hypoglycemia Decompression sickness Unemployment Medicare (Canada) Bipolar disorder Sickle-cell disease Obesity Oral contraceptive Equine conformation Malaria Condom Group A streptococcal infection Strap-on dildo Prenatal diagnosis Twin Cephalic disorder HIV Roe v.

why is it that americans seem to think that they won wwi and wwii all by themselves the americans generally seem to believe that they won wwi and wwii alone without anyone elses involvement when in fact they were inactive in the first instance until and didnt actually engage in battle until a few months before the end of the war and in the second instance were quite willing to let britain face the nazis alone with little more than a milititia for almost two years except for some but very little financial help these decisions would be fine if it wasn't for the constant bleating by us citizens about how they saved the world they seem to forget that unlike the rest of europe britain was still unconquered i'm not denying britain needed help but why do americans insist on trying to make everyone believe they did it alone is this just a lack of education or arrogance on the part of a people with an invincibility complex carlmoles you are a prime example of what i'm talking about the rest of you yanks who say theyve never heared anyone say anything please read his comment it the sort of thing we brits get all the time and is disrespectful to the sacrifice of many thousands of british servicemen and woman not to mention thousands of innocent civilians maybe we just get to see the uneducated imbeciles point of view over here to everybody else thankyou for your honest answers and beleive me i am not anti us quite the opposite in fact though bush no comment it infuriates me and i'm an american there's an extremely vile and dangerous conservative element at work in the american culture right now started in the ' 's that wants to re write history and fire people up the people who actually lived during wwi and wwii weren't like that they did their duty and that's all there was to it scares the hell out of me never would i have thought back in the ' 's when i was a kid that americans could behave so abysmally the people behind this radical conservatism are straight from hell they are also poorly educated and sadly misinformed agree with wounded duck's sarcasm re montgomery if he was your best general thank god for eisenhower bradley and george c marshall  World War II The Manchester Regiment World War I Appeasement Battle of the Bulge Operation Market Garden Conservatism Irish Guards Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II George Galloway Western Front (World War II) Battle of France Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Barry Goldwater Supernatural Polish September Campaign Conservative Party (UK) Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Laura Schlessinger Red Scare Theory of conduct Islam as a political movement Fahrenheit 9/11 Franco-Prussian War Western betrayal The King's Regiment (Liverpool) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Plame affair History of the British Army George S.

why did the bantus move in the first millenium far more than a migration it was an expansion both physically and linguistically it is very likely that many bantu speakers descend from non bantus who adopted bantu languages beyond that the climate of northern and central africa was going through a pattern of increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation from the second millennium bc onward so central africa was becoming unfitted for the bantus agriculture and animal husbandry particularly among those on the southern range of their original territory it became advantageous to move southward toward better territory they had reached modern zimbabwe by about and they continued their expansion afterward  Bantu Africa Bantu languages South Africa Early Congolese History Iron Age History of Africa History of South Africa Economic history of Africa Adamawa Province Neolithic Europe Magyars Khoisan Europe Bird migration Portuguese Creole Democratic Republic of the Congo Swahili language Namibia Indigenous peoples Luo history Human migration Sesotho language Agriculture Semitic African languages Indo-European languages Mozambique Geography of Chile Kurgan hypothesis Uganda before 1900 Geography of Russia Ndebele language Zambia Geography of Brazil Rocky Mountains Click consonant Middle Ages Centre Province, Cameroon Equatorial Guinea Johannesburg Dravidian people North Province, Cameroon Beti-Pahuin Afrocentrism Prehistoric Europe Niger-Congo languages Semitic languages Somalia Elis Prefecture Proto-Indo-Europeans Xhosa Geography of Algeria Japan Climate of the United Kingdom Zulu language Esperanto as an international language Regional accents of English speakers Celt Kalmykia Germanic languages Climate change Sikkim Greek language Shona language East Province, Cameroon Malawi Prehistoric Britain Effects of global warming Geography of Spain Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Guns, Germs, and Steel Creole language Luhya United States South Korea Geography of Mexico History of Finland Khoisan languages Gbe languages Geography of China Germanic tribes South Slavic languages Bamileke Appalachian Mountains Hamitic Little Ice Age Yuezhi African Jew Languages of Uganda Tbilisi Climate of India Costa Rica Economy of Africa Geography of Albania British Empire Geography of Africa Emperor of Japan Pacific Ocean

what is the purpose of hte indian caste system i'm doing a project and i need to know what the purpose of the caste system was the purpose or the reason the caste system is there to begin with the purpose is to keep people in their places within the rigid hierarchical structure that most of india still follows to keep untouchables doing the grunt work all their lives with no chance of finding good work in their lifetimes it is sad really that people are born into a body that determines whether or not they have a chance to make something of themselves the brahmans get educated have money and therefore get the good jobs like doctor lawyer scientist computer expert etc the lower classes are born into debt and remain in debt their whole lives the reason for that is because they do not make enough money to pay back the debt only to survive barely essentially the lowest class the untouchables are slaves religiously the caste system has to do with the belief in reincarnation if someone performs good deeds in their life they can be reborn into a more noble caste in their next life once they reincarnate as brahma the highest caste if they are good in that life they will go to nirvana basically heaven to them but much different however if you are a bad person in this life you could end up as a sheep or cow or even worse an insect in your next life the idea is that every living thing has a soul and these souls never die they just go from vessel to vessel body to body in between lifetimes only the highest souls can ascend to nirvana and not bear the suffering of inhabiting an earthly form  Reincarnation Soul Indian caste system Brahmanism Heaven Karma in Hinduism Hinduism Immortality Dalit (outcaste) Brahman Advaita Vedanta Afterlife God Simone Weil Karma Bhagavad Gita Philo Religion Hell Max Weber Christian eschatology Trimurti Summa Theologiae Theosophy Adi Shankara Meaning of life Ascended master Capitalism Sri Aurobindo Lord of Light Scientology beliefs and practices Theodicy Eastern philosophy Jainism Social class Vishnu Samsara Sant Thakar Singh Pitaten Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Nicomachean Ethics Sikhism Ramanuja B.

the world would be a better place if the confederacy would have won i have several reasons for my line of thinking if the confederate states of america would have won the u s federal goverment would be far less powerful than it is today therefore reducing terrorism warfare worldwide issues because if the us had a bitter enemy pushed right up against them in one small continent they would be far less apt to interfere in world affairs the shearing away of americans rights and freedoms would be much less today because of the impacts of the two american nations alliances i e the usa germany the csa england perhaps france the history of the world wars may have been far more in balance and far less destructive just to silence the critics slavery would have died a slower but far less tumulutous death anyway probably before what are your opinions on these points and this subject i am a military historian and not not not a racist btw i've always believed that had the csa won the war sooner or later the southern and northern states would reunite threats to american territories in the west by mexico and british canada would demand an alliance of some form reunification would be achieved by concessions to the states and a revised articles of confederation after a confederate victory northern states would have demanded consessions from the federal government and a weaker central authority would emerge newly admitted states would have more autonomy but i can't envision the divide between north and south surviving long i think the csa would have abolished slavery within years after the war the slave based agrarian economy was no longer profitable alternative sources of cotton sugar and indigo chiefly from british possessions would soon make slavery obsolete the issue would be their fate under the new constitutional regime some would be compelled to settle african colonies like liberia and sierra leone others would form semi independent mini states still others would assimilate and integrate into anglo society over time a confederate victory would have changed the course of world history my reunified america would be less entangled in foreign affairs spanish power in cuba and the philippines would be unchecked would we have purchased alaska from russia would british claims in the northwest be thwarted i think the territory of the states would be diminished due to a weaker central government i disagree that a usa german and csa england alliance would have resulted in less destructive world wars russia and austro hungary would still have initiated the first conflict if germany and england took their historical positions a new american schism would have erupted into another war  American Civil War History of the United States United States Slavery History of slavery in the United States History of Europe History of the Southern United States German Confederation History of United States imperialism History of the United States (1865-1918) Federation Timeline-191 British Empire Soviet Union Imperialism in Asia Texas Revolution World War I Germany Racism World War II Napoleonic Wars Decolonization Africa History of Austria American Revolution Austria-Hungary Otto von Bismarck French colonial empires United States Constitution Jew State History of the United States Constitution Canada Southern United States History of the United States (1776-1789) History of Malaysia Nigeria Freedom Party (Harry Turtledove) Yugoslavia War of the Spanish Succession Libertarian socialism Spain Liberalism Military history of the United States History of Germany Timeline of United States diplomatic history Military history of the Soviet Union History of Germany since 1945 Arab-Israeli conflict Louisiana Purchase Democratic Party (United States) Western United States History of Poland (1795-1918) Dominion History of Hungary Louis XIV of France Penda of Mercia Transcontinental nation Switzerland Political status of Taiwan Liberia Iraq disarmament crisis East Germany Mexican-American War Liberal Party of Canada History of the European Union Anglo-Saxons German reunification Reconstruction Abkhazia Empire of Brazil Cyprus dispute Tariff History of Romania History of Lithuania History of Brazil Politics of the United States Colombia Freedom of the press Anarchism Abolitionism Franks Kurdish people Racism in the United States

what choices did america make to conclude ww and what impact did it have in the the obvious answer is whether to use the atomic bomb or invade japan plans were well advanced for the invasion the landings were planned for kyushu estimates of wounded and dead were very high perhaps as many as a million japanese were expected to die in the invasion these estimates were based on the invasion of okinawa the first home island that the u s invaded and captured the japanese had planned suicide attacks by women and children armed with rocks and sticks the concept was to make the americans sustain such heavy losses that they would back off from the landings and seek some kind of negotiated peace the emperor would have remained a deity and the sacred soil of japan would have remained unsullied by foreigners truman had little choice if he was to save the u s casualties for the invasion he actually saved japan and the u s from even worse carnage to boot japan would probably had to deal with a soviet occupation probably all of hokkaido the 's would likely have seen a partitioned japan with communist government in hokkaido and north honshu the korean war probably would not have happened the north koreans could have invaded s korea and had the whole thing wrapped up before the u s could act the repelling of the n koreans and later the chinese was possbile with the help of the japanese japan earned its return to independence with their eager assistance to the korean war conduct perhaps five years before it would otherwise have had to wait  Korean War Operation Downfall Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan Vietnam War Surrender of Japan USS Missouri (BB-63) Polish September Campaign Operation August Storm USS Yorktown (CV-10) Battle of Okinawa Participants in World War II Korea First Indochina War USS Wilkes-Barre (CL-103) 2003 Invasion of Iraq Military history of Japan USS Uhlmann (DD-687) Chinese Civil War Second Sino-Japanese War USS Taussig (DD-746) Post-invasion Iraq, 2003___2005 USS Wedderburn (DD-684) USS Walker (DD-517) History of Korea (1900___1950) History of the Soviet Union (1927-1953) Eastern Front (World War II) Demographics of Japan Peleliu Continuation War USS Taylor (DD-468) USS Thompson (DD-627) Harry S.

why do we care hitler's music collection turns up in dead russian soldier's attic berlin adolf hitler the most notorious champion of richard wagner and racially pure german music banished jewish and russian musicians from the concert halls of the third reich but apparently listened secretly to their work new light has been shed on the nazi leader s musical tastes by the discovery of what are said to be a hundred of his gramophone records found in the attic of a former soviet intelligence officer lev besymenski there were classical recordings performed by the best orchestras of europe and germany with the best soloists of the age mr besymenski said in a document explaining how the records came into his possession the year old who helped to interrogate captured nazi generals died this summer the document and the record collection have now been made available to der spiegel magazine because it shows us that everyone even hateful old hitler is all too human susceptible to the grasping tentacles of hypocrisy we make him out to be a villain and he truly is but tend to downplay the fact that he's not completely the disgusting bigoted man he's portrayed which certainly doesn't lessen the horribleness of his actions and crimes we can however take away from this article a very important lesson at his essence every man is the same prey to the same desires and demons as his fellows there are some things we can't forgive but as a compensation not to mention precaution we can always try to understand why something happened that's why we analyze history so much knowing the motives for an individual nation's actions helps us make better decisions when interacting with someone else under similar circumstances clearly hitler did not believe in the falsehoods he and the propaganda arm of his government was propagating that tells us he's not much different from the next man and not completely mad from this we can infer that he would also suffer from the same weaknesses as the next man greed for power fame etc and so on and so forth cheers  Adolf Hitler Heinrich M__ller Nazi Germany Propaganda Gestapo Holocaust denial President of Germany The Holocaust Richard Wagner Eastern Front (World War II) Waffen-SS Nazism National Socialist German Workers Party Schutzstaffel Max Planck World War II Fatherland (novel) Nazi architecture Parsifal Hogan's Heroes Operation Barbarossa Andreas Hillgruber Battle of the Bulge History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union Red Army Anschluss Joachim von Ribbentrop Weimar Republic Pope Pius XII Battle of Berlin History of the Jews in Germany Rudolf Hess Continuation War Beer Hall Putsch Anti-Semitism Wehrmacht Heinrich Himmler Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact Ernst Z__ndel Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler Hitler's death Erich von Manstein Appeasement David Irving Magda Goebbels The Bunker Historical revisionism (political) Richard Strauss Patriotism Karl D__nitz Racial policy of Nazi Germany Paul von Hindenburg Anton Bruckner End of World War II in Europe War Neo-Nazism Expulsion of Germans after World War II Martin Heidegger Mystique (comics) Joseph Goebbels Germany Occupation of Czechoslovakia Grammy Award Friedrich Nietzsche Daniel Barenboim Albert Speer Racism Adolf Eichmann Alfred Rosenberg Mein Kampf Arnold Schoenberg Music New anti-Semitism Polish September Campaign Music of Germany Central Intelligence Agency Ethnic cleansing Hitler in popular culture Pursuit of Nazi collaborators Axis Powers Military history of the Soviet Union Hitler's political beliefs Goodness and value theory ODESSA Hermann G__ring History of Germany Grunge music Sant Thakar Singh The Great Dictator British Free Corps

who wishes guy fawkes had succeeded i would hope that nobody living in the modern world would have wanted his success he was a fanatic who wanted a catholic absolute king of england rather than a protestant who had a parliament to guide him my own belief is that success of the gunpowder plot would have led to civil war in england which would have ultimately resulted in a loss for fawkes and his supporters and would probably have led to repression of catholics on a scale previously unknown in england all the exploration and mercantile advances that were accomplished in the jacobean and carolean reigns would not have happened and the enlightenment that allowed the advance of science and engineering would not have occurred when it did if at all even though i follow the catholic faith i am glad that this misguided fanatic failed just as i hope all fanatics everywhere fail in their conspiracies  James I of England Guy Fawkes Gunpowder Plot History of the British constitution James II of England Anti-Catholicism Palace of Westminster Philip II of Spain Charles I of England Jews in the Middle Ages British monarchy French Wars of Religion Early Modern France Late Middle Ages Guy Fawkes Night House of Bourbon Confederate Ireland Pacifism Parliament of the United Kingdom Anne of Great Britain History of England William III of England Reactionary Henry VIII of England Separation of church and state Elizabeth I of England Protestant Reformation English Civil War Williamite war in Ireland Mid-nineteenth century Spain Roman Catholic Church Irish Republicanism Mary II of England Wars of the Three Kingdoms French Revolution Anglicanism Joseph Soloveitchik Catholic Church in Great Britain Wars of the Roses Enlightenment Spain Charles II of England Prime Minister of the United Kingdom History of Scotland Religion Polish-Muscovite War (1605-1618) William the Silent Battle of the Boyne History of Germany George I of Great Britain Renaissance Edward VI of England Mary I of England Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford Coup d'__tat George II of Great Britain Age of Enlightenment Foundation of Modern Sweden Scottish Civil War History of Austria Catholicism Jewish Polish history origins to 1600s Irish Rebellion of 1641 Appeal Fundamentalism Emperor Guangwu of Han Henry IV of France Atheism Ancient Greece History of Modern Greece Puritan Oliver Cromwell Henry Grattan Henry Garnet Plantations of Ireland History of Europe History of the Jews in England Mercantilism History of Spain George Fox Technocracy (World of Darkness) Mary I of Scotland War United States religious history German Empire War of the Spanish Succession Scotland Third English Civil War Jewish views of religious pluralism Lewes Henry VI of England Robert I of Scotland History of Poland (1795-1918) Fireworks Transhumanism Thomas More Maximilien Robespierre Succession to the British Throne

why did constantine found constantinople constantine was declared emperor in britain why would he shift his capital to the east founding roma nova constantinople instead of just taking the throne in rome like everyone else i couldn't find an adequate explanation for this i know there was already the city of byzantium there but he made it the imperial capital even though he was western and the sole emperor of the roman empire because by the time constantine assumed power rome's importance was spiritual not political since at least the reign of the antonines marcus aurelius trajan the imperial court had been moved from rome to mediolanum which today we know as milan the vast geographic expanse of the empire called for it and milan was in a much better position geographically than rome to recieve information from places like gaul or hispania in the th century ce emperor honorius moved the capital to ravenna because ravenna is surrounded by swamplands and is thus much more easily defensible than milan some emperors went their entire reign without stepping foot in rome it was during the reign of diocletian that the empire was split into two administrative halves the western empire and the eastern empire diocletian envisioned the tetrarchy where two augustus would reign over each administrative halve and an official caesar would be appointed his heir this was because the empire had become so bureaucratized and inefficient that for anything meaningful to happen such as a military expedition usually the emperor himself had to be involved so emperors in the two halves could deal with the two trouble spots on the frontiers the rhine river which separated roman gaul from barbarian germany and the eastern frontier which separated rome from the sassanid persian empire in theory it would have solved two problems the problem of imperial succession which plagued the empire throughout the rd century and the military situation which was eating away at the edged of the empire in reality the tetrarchy collapsed as soon as diocletian retired not only did the wars of succession continue constantine spent nearly half his reign as a usurper but the barbarian migrations continued the enfeebled western half was unable to hold them along the rhine and the eastern half was too pre occupied with the persians to stop them from penetrating over the danube the administrative capitals established by diocletian were milan and byzantium the eastern half benefitted greatly from trade from the middle and far east and egypt was the most prosperous province in the empire meanwhile the western half was extremely poor and africa was the only province still making money constantine probably saw the signs that the west was doomed so he made his capital the capital of the east byzantium renaming it as you pointed out nova roma or new rome but for its citizens they had a nickname for it constantinopolis the city of constantine over time the nickname stuck more than its official name and constantinopolis was eventually shortened to constantinople  Ancient Rome Roman Britain Justinian I Praetorian Guard Timeline of Portuguese history (Lusitania and Gallaecia) Roman Governor History of Rome Lugdunum Western world Constantine III (usurper) Marcus Aurelius Italia (Roman province) Crisis of the Third Century Alaric I Theodosius I Hadrian Ostrogoth Franks Parthia Sassanid dynasty Roman Emperor (Late Empire) Roman usurper Roman Navy Trajan History of the Balkans History of West Eurasia Dacia Military history of the Roman Empire History of Germany Flavius Augustus Honorius Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy __stanbul Mark Antony Seleucid Empire Phocas Heraclius Middle Ages Governor Aurelian Persian Empire Year of the Four Emperors Ravenna Valentinian I Tiberius Roman Emperor (Crisis of the Third Century) Roman legion Crispus Ancient history East-West Schism Claudius Ottoman Empire War of the League of Cambrai Military history of France History of Slovakia Rome: Total War Ricimer Byzantine army History of the Middle East Migration Period Qing Dynasty End of Han Dynasty War of the Spanish Succession Arch of Constantine Three Kingdoms History of Italy during Roman times Filioque clause Exarchate of Ravenna Marius Greece Ataulf Late Antiquity Papal States Visigoth Arianism

what about traditions what is that thing which make us getaway or forget and ignore our traditions it is important to us it is the only evidence to our history traditions are a very important thing i think one of the big problems is the new generations they are completely different from the older generations as far as how they are motivated and what gets them going of course we still have the same rebelliousness that the older generations had but its a little different now the new generations seem more self absorbed they dont seem to have too much of a care for the past or traditions if its not what they want to do then they are not going to do it and as this may seem like the right way to be there are certain things that even though we dont want to we should do upholding traditions is one of them sure it might not be the funnest but its your heritage your culture we will not succeed in the future unless we learn from the mistakes of our past in order to not repeat those mistakes traditions also aid in this in that if you have a better understanding of your traditions you have a better understanding of the past and im not saying its just my generations or even the next one that is starting out i feel it came even from my parents generation maybe we can break the chain of apathy before the next generation gets hit too hard with it we will see  David Hume Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Causality Socrates The nature of God in Western theology Clinical depression Domestic violence Music genre Sociocultural evolution Children of Dune Philosophy Nicomachean Ethics Software engineering Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Strategic management Transactional analysis Asperger syndrome Hearing impairment Theory of conduct Engineering Ranma __ characters Anthropology Second language acquisition Black (people) Phoebe Halliwell Past teachings of Prem Rawat Franz Boas Chinese character Atomic Kitten Free will Pok__mon Live!

my lai massacre what is so significant about the my lai massacre on the outcome of vietnam war the vietnam war was a complex event not fought too ably by american politicians although our opponent was north vietnam for inexplicable reasons we mainly bombed south vietnam and fought there against the viet cong when we did take the war to north vietnam we should have bombed it to bits and flooded its rice farms we instead subjected the south to most of the fighting this did cause some unrest from the south vietnamese and of course there were large numbers of viet cong there sometimes it was hard for u s soldiers to tell friend from foe lt william calley apparently did kill some south vietnamese civilians at the time not considering the impossible position we put our u s soldiers calley's actions were decried as horribly inhumane unfortunately soldiers get terribly abused by civilian leadership today our military is carrying out police duty in baghdad and being senseless maimed as a result some soldiers have had five tours of duty in afghanistan and iraq regardless of all the specifics the fact remains lt william calley was put in a very bad situation and this has to be considered  Vietnam War National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam My Lai Massacre Winter Soldier Investigation South Vietnam Tet Offensive Platoon (film) Army of the Republic of Vietnam U.S. invasion of Afghanistan Opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Suicide bombing Phoenix Program John Kerry military service controversy John Kerry Iraq War Prisoner-of-war camp Pol Pot First Indochina War Military use of children Korean War Casualties of the conflict in Iraq since 2003 Mosin-Nagant Battle of Ap Bac Vietnam Veterans Against the War Vietnam War Massacre at Hue Post-invasion Iraq, 2003___2005 Multinational force in Iraq Strategic bombing USS Valley Forge (CV-45) M16 (rifle) Karabiner 98k Land mine Crime against humanity Indochina Wars United States Air Force 1982 Lebanon War USS Turner Joy (DD-951) State terrorism Battle of Long Tan Peace movement Sniper Aerial bombing of cities War on Terrorism Vietnam veteran Jane Fonda Kosovo War History of the Australian Army Seymour Hersh Medal of Honor Conscientious objector Human rights in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq Vietnamese people Terrorism History of Vietnam Japanese war crimes Abu Musab al-Zarqawi Military history of the Soviet Union USS Enterprise (CVN-65) Arlington National Cemetery USS Towers (DDG-9) Al-Qaeda in Iraq Vo Nguyen Giap 2003 Invasion of Iraq David H.

why there were no clearing process by ancient romans after the disaster in pompeii i wonder why the roman emperor didn't sent out troops and workers to clear and rebuilt the city instead of leaving it untouched for century if the mountain kept erupt then why there are people who willing to live there today much the same 'problem' exists on the big island of hawai'i where an on going eruption has forced the abandoment of thousands of acres entire sub dvisions of homes destroyed never to be rebuilt there was pleny of land the population of the earth was low so no one needed to rebuilt pompeii besides it was a grave and who wants to build on a grave well they did but that will cost you another pts the romans merely moved down the coast a ways and built a new city in time that city encroached upon the old city and that is when the old city was dug up mined for its treasures and turned intr a tourist mecca and pompeii was not a 'roman' city it retain many of its own customs and language and thus when it was destroyed the romans didn't weeo in fact pompeii was forgotton becoming legend much like atlantis unlike atlantis it was rediscovered http www mnsu edu emuseum archaeology sites europe pompeii html rome's control over pompeii was distant the city was allowed to retain its own language and culture but was required to admit itself subject to rome without benefiting from the status of roman citizenship pompeii reluctantly accepted this situation for centuries finally when the social war began in b c they saw a chance at freedom and joined forces with other roman allies against the city that oppressed them the rebels and rome fought for two years but one of rome's most brilliant generals sulla eventually defeated the campanians he took pompeii and herculaneum in b c though the allies were defeated they were awarded the status of roman citizenship in order to quell any further uprisings however their former liberties were taken away and rome established colonies of army veterans to help keep the order eventually sulla established the cornelia veneria colony in campania which began the romanization of the region over the years the memory of pompeii and the surrounding cities faded into a vague legend about the lost treasure of la citta the city interest in recovery of the ancient sites did not return until the fourteenth century when the renaissance brought a renewed fascination with all things antique ancient writers such as pliny the younger perotto sannazzaro and dion cassius mentioned pompeii and the disaster that had befallen it tantalizing hints as to what lay beneath the campanian soil were also unearthed based on artifacts discovered by people who lived on the land scholar humanists hypothesized that the ancient objects they found came from the famous la citta excavations did not occur however until the eighteenth century when herculaneum was rediscovered by a peasant digging a well pompeii itself was found during an excavation that began on march from that date on excavations at pompeii have continued sporadically portions of the site remain uncovered and excavation and research teams are still attempting to reveal this mysterious city's secrets peace  Mount Vesuvius Roman Republic Archaeology Roman Empire Capua Julius Caesar Troy Ancient Greece Library of Alexandria Naples Heinrich Schliemann Roman Britain Pompey Ancient Egypt Marius Neoclassicism Carthage Atlantis Timeline of ancient Rome Campania History of Slovakia __zmir Lost city Burial Spear of Destiny Military history of the Roman Empire Roman currency Western Roman Empire Lucius Cornelius Sulla Napoleonic Wars Hannibal Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Roman law Palestrina Pliny the Elder Ancient history Byzantine Empire Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II First Punic War War of the Spanish Succession Pliny the Younger Italian Renaissance History of China History of Europe Taranto Stargate SG-1 Antioch, Pisidia Battle of the Teutoburg Forest History of Catalonia Biblical archaeology Mausoleum of Maussollos Franco-Prussian War Property (ownership right) Hellenistic Greece Sylvanus Morley French Revolutionary Wars Franks Oak Island American Revolutionary War Erotic art in Pompeii History of Greek and Roman Egypt Sith Philippi Burma Campaign Temple Mount Mithraism Scythia Past and present anarchist communities History of Denmark Sparta Democracy Hadrian Art in Ancient Greece Military history of France History of Germany Caesar Augustus World War II War of the League of Cambrai Tutankhamun Transformers: Cybertron Holy Roman Empire StarCraft Episode VI Italian unification Deluge (mythology) Bratislava Castle Ur Military history of Japan Cultural Revolution Elam Jamestown, Virginia

did bobby pendragon really save eelong when the traveler died pendragon series the story begins when bobby arrives on quillan in the flume straight from zadaa where in the sixth book he helped loor save zadaa and mysteriously raised her from the dead bobby appears in a huge empty warehouse and is promptly attacked by quigs saint dane's assassins which on quillan turn out to be giant spiders the size of kittens after killing a quig he finds that it's a robot upon escaping the quigs he finds his way out of the warehouse and discovers a huge arcade filled with games he soon learns that games of quillan are much more serious than on second earth because the losers are often killed he also puts on a silver bracelet called a loop which he soon finds out is a tracking device that is nearly impossible to slip off after being chased by and escaping from robot policmen called dados he finds himself in the middle of a city he later finds out to be called rune he notices that the word blok seems to be posted everywhere but he has no idea what the word means while he is trying to be inconspicuous and escape from the dados he notices a strange incident two people who grab their left biceps as a strange gesture however he is soon distracted by a game being played on the big screens he sees two challengers playing a game called tato together he notices that one of the challengers is wearing a traveler ring unfortunately the traveler loses and dies which makes bobby angry and determined to avenge this death however bobby is soon captured by the android dados who drive him to a castle bobby soon realizes that the bright red shirt he is wearing sets him apart as a challenger a contestant of the games bobby is greeted by the siblings laberge and veego who are very hospitable to bobby bobby however is not friendly to them and spends his first evening in his new room in the castle writing his journals and reflecting on how he doesn't have any idea what's wrong with quillan and how saint dane fits into the mix soon bobby learns of how much challengers are forced to play games he immediately has to beat a game called hook just to get to dinner and then promptly afterwards he is rushed into another game called tock to prove his competetiveness and worth after he managed to win the game he meets nevva winter a blok assistant later he is introduced to nevva and learns she is really the traveler from quillan while the traveller who died playing tato was named remudi and was the traveler from the territory of ibara unfortunately before nevva can explain more she has to leave bobby stranded in the strange territory trapped with laberge and veego in the challenger's castle with no idea what to do next bobby spends a few weeks at the castle and learns a lot about challengers and games unfortunately he still doesn't come close to finding saint dane as he does not learn anything more about the rest of quillan finally after a long time at the castle nevva takes bobby to a meeting outside of the castle in the blok office there bobby learns how blok is a coroporation that over many generations has gradually taken over quillan and forced people to live a harsh life he also finds out that saint dane has been pretending to be one of the ten leaders of blok called mr kayto there saint dane makes an offer to bobby he says that if bobby will compete in the grand x an upcoming game then he will tell bobby the most hidden secret of the travellers's true nature though saint dane's offer is tempting bobby decides not to risk his life in any more games and refuses it when bobby is driving back to the castle he is kidnapped by some mysterious people wearing black and is taken to an underground hideout he finds out that they are a secret team called the revivers and that their goal is to save quillan from the control of blok and make it a free territory again nevva is one of them they want bobby to compete in the grand x in order to stir the majority of the people into a revolt against blok to help convince bobby to make this choice they show him to a top secret hidden library they call mr pop which contains the history of quillan bobby finally agrees and is sure that his decision will be the turning point for quillan and will save the territory bobby turns himself in to laberge and veego then immediately starts competing in the grand x against a champion called challenger green during the game bobby learns some astonishing secrets he learns that laberge and veego are from the territory of veelox but were taken here by saint dane he also learns that saint dane has taken them to many different territories including cloral eelong and zadaa and got the ideas for some of their games from those territories in the end bobby wins not only the game but also the hearts of the people and they start revolting against blok just like bobby and the revivers wanted however just when he thinks the territory of quillan is saved he is captured by saint dane and finds out that nevva had been with saint dane all along he then learns that though both of them were blindfolded nevva gave away the location of the huge library since she carried a bug to mr pop which the dados would later incinerate bobby loses the territory of quillan to saint dane he also learns that challenger green was really saint dane in disguise saint dane also mentions something called the convergence which he believes is inevitable nevva reveals that she will probably become the traveller for ibara since remudi is dead nevva and saint dane escape and it is revealed that saint dane has taught nevva how to transform they both turn into giant birds and fly away the journal ends with bobby telling mark and courtney that before he goes off to fight saint dane again he will return to second earth to take a break but also to find out what has been happening there just before bobby leaves for the flume he talks to a woman named elli winter who is nevva's mother elli tells bobby how she was originally supposed to be the traveller from quillan but was too afraid to take on the responsibility so gave it to her daughter now she feels she is ready to take on the responibility as on veelox the territory has a last vestige of hope  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases New York Giants One Piece minor characters The Amber

would've germany gained the upper hand if they attacked the middle east instead of the soviet union ww will it help how will it help and why it will help if not will it fail how would germany get worse and why will it lead to the same german defeat interesting one invading the middle east via turkey probably would have brought russia in so it would have had to be a north african campaign and there simply isn't room to deploy armies there on the same scale as in russia supply becomes interesting with no need for murmansk archangel convoys convoys much british shipping and many naval units are freed up the naval fight in the mediterranean would have been even more intense the aircraft that were sent to russia under lend lease and more than tanks excluding light tanks heavy trucks light vehicles including light armour would all be available for the british forces and there were resources in russia that germany needed not least it was believed was food on december herbert backe the state secretary in the food and agriculture ministry released a confidential report backe further concluded that the longer term food shortages could only be solved through an attack on the soviet union followed by wholesale confiscations of russian foodstuffs and livestock a middle east strategy would not have solved that and at that stage in the war by axis agreement the mediterranean had been assigned to italy's sphere of influence and operation it was only italy's failures in greece and egypt which initially drew in german forces to the region  Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II World War II Operation Barbarossa Middle East Theatre of World War II Participants in World War II Continuation War European Theatre of World War II World War I Blitzkrieg Battle of Normandy Middle East Campaign Battleship Battle of Kursk Military history of the Soviet Union Eastern Front (World War II) Ancient warfare Mediterranean Theatres of World War II Timeline of World War II Hero City Napoleonic Wars Red Army Second Battle of the Atlantic Russia Battle of Berlin Marshall Plan Soviet Union Military history of Italy during World War II Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry Battle of the Bulge War of the Austrian Succession History of Europe Famine Battle of France Greek Civil War Battle of the Mediterranean HMS Ramillies (07) Operation Torch Operation Silver Fox History of the British Army Royal Air Force Axis Powers NATO Norwegian Campaign Second Battle of El Alamein U.S. invasion of Afghanistan Battle of Crete Aircraft carrier Allies of World War II Military history of Egypt during World War II Battle of Stalingrad Augustus Agar Indian Army T-34 Mechanized infantry P-51 Mustang Manuel I Comnenus International response to Hurricane Katrina History of Modern Greece Eastern Question Naval battles of World War I Tunisia Campaign Cold War (1947-1953) and its origins Greco-Italian War Burma Campaign Military strategy Pacific War Iraq War HMS Electra (H27) British Empire First Punic War Gulf War Russo-Japanese War Cavalry French Revolutionary Wars Panzer II Yom Kippur War History of Russia Force H Arctic convoys of World War II The King's Regiment (Liverpool) Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign M4 Sherman British Mandate of Palestine Franco-Prussian War Russian Revolution of 1917 Battle of Britain Japanese strategic planning for mainland Asia (1905-1940) Anti-aircraft warfare

do we make history or does it make us i know what it means i just want your opinion on this also explain why that is a great question if it was given to you by a teacher thank him or her for challenging you to think like others who have answered the question i think it is a little bit of both to come to that conclusion however you must play a little bit with the semantics history makes us in the sense that we are the past we are the sum of what has come before us take race relations in the u s for example without slavery and without the fact that our immigration patterns have brought many different cultures and ethnicities into coexistence we would not be the people we are today we would not have jazz music we would not have texican food we would not have had the watts riots or jim crow laws we would not have the mafia we would not have rock n' roll in short we would not have so many things that we take for granted on the other hand we make history in the sense that history is what we remember it to be in other words if we do not know that something happened even though it did our view of the past is altered from reality for example many people have no idea how involved in the middle east the united states was before they take for granted because they don't know any better that we became involved in the region only as a result of the attacks on the world trade center therefore they have a skewed view of the past but it is one that has been made for them by their lack of knowledge about history hope this helps  Science Epistemology Supernatural Theory of conduct Philosophy of language Southern United States Creationism Religion Jew Summa Theologiae Racism Primitive accumulation of capital Theodicy Logic A Course In Miracles Predestination Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) African American Deconstruction Rudolf Hermann Lotze Philosophical skepticism Causality Free will Donald Davidson (philosopher) Socrates Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Education Victor Cousin Second language acquisition Philosophy of space and time Modernism Young Earth creationism Philosophy of science Immanuel Kant Philosophy of mathematics Midwestern United States Cultural relativism Meaning Milton H.

can anyone tell me about the ten days that shook the world by john reed ten days that shook the world is the account by john reed of what he saw during the russian revolution reed was an american communist and journalist who is the only american known to be buried in the kremlin throughout this book we read a series of observations and dialogues reported by reed virtually without comment although his bias is apparent this book is a classic case of missing the forest for the trees the view is too up close to permit the reader to see the big picture one does not look here for the history of the revolution we look here for its spirit in writing this book reed gives the reader a view of himself and other american communists his view can best be summarized in his comment that while watching a funeral he realized that the russian people no longer needed priests to pray them into heaven because they were building a world brighter than any which heaven promised this hope is in stark contrast to the now known communist record  John Reed (journalist) Russian Revolution of 1917 Ten Days that Shook the World (book) Book of Mormon Plame affair Sharon Tate Jacques-Louis David Christian eschatology Tacitus Funeral of Pope John Paul II Ann Coulter Judaism The Catcher in the Rye John F.

why does the coliseum in rome have an elliptical shape why not circle or square i would imagine that the shape of the building was dictated either by the shape of the arena that was required or the shape of nero's artificial lake over which it was built clearly a square building would mean that there were blind spots for the spectators but why an ellipse rather than a circle i can only think that a circle wouldn't be much good for chariots and therefore they decided on an ellipse edit no i don't mean chariot races i don't think these were ever staged at the colosseum i am suggesting that chariots may have been used for some of the mock battles and it wouldn't have been very interesting if they just went round in a circle chariot racing was held at the circus maximus  Colosseum Chariot racing Circus Maximus Circus Ellipse Kepler's laws of planetary motion Chariot Planetary orbit Gladiator Nero Astrodynamics Gladiator (2000 film) Madison Square Garden Boudicca Amphitheatre Super ellipse Polarization Hannibal Stadium Roman Empire Sundial Culture of Ancient Rome Wood carving Second Punic War Conic section Domus Aurea Nazi architecture Roman Kingdom Pok__mon XD: Gale of Darkness Via Sacra Arch of Constantine Race track Roman dictator Tarquinius Priscus Roman Emperor Apsis Mobile Fighter G Gundam The nature of God in Western theology Philosophy of language Taikyoku shogi Battle of Alesia Timeline of ancient Rome Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Rome Horse St. Peter's Basilica Maximus Decimus Meridius Keplerian problem Roman Republic Sling (weapon) Orre Verona President's Park Servius Tullius Tiberius Crop circle The Austere Academy St. Louis Rams Dundas Square Poker jargon Maka dai dai shogi Apollo 8 Apollonius of Perga Sun Ancient Olympic Games Caesar Augustus Dai dai shogi Titus Campus Martius Tai shogi Rome: Total War Thomas Cole Ontological argument Firefighter Pontifex Maximus Year of the Four Emperors David Hume Olympic Games Elliptic curve English literature Washington, D.C.

please write about the battle of plassey british rule in india is conventionally described as having begun in on june rd of that year at the battle of plassey a small village and mango grove between calcutta and murshidabad the forces of the east india company under robert clive defeated the army of siraj ud daulah the nawab of bengal the battle lasted no more than a few hours and indeed the outcome of the battle had been decided long before the soldiers came to the battlefield the aspirant to the nawab's throne mir jafar was induced to throw in his lot with clive and by far the greater number of the nawab's soldiers were bribed to throw away their weapons surrender prematurely and even turn their arms against their own army jawaharlal nehru in the discovery of india justly describes clive as having won the battle by promoting treason and forgery and pointedly notes that british rule in india had an unsavoury beginning and something of that bitter taste has clung to it ever since clive thought of the battle as the climax to his career a striking testimony to the extraordinary shallowness of his character while his enemies whose judgment modernizing indians are still inclined to accept attributed clive's success to the faint heartedness of the effeminate and luxurious asiatics in one fundamental respect the battle of plassey signified the state of things to come few british victories were achieved without the use of bribes and few promises made by the british were ever kept no doubt it was these traits of honor and fair play to which thomas macaulay was alluding when he wrote with his usual pomposity no oath which superstition can devise no hostage however precious inspires a hundredth part of the confidence which is produced by the yea yea and nay nay of a british envoy  Bengal Indian rebellion of 1857 Siraj Ud Daulah British East India Company Mir Jafar Mughal era Black Hole of Calcutta Imperialism in Asia Simon Commission Princely state Subhash Chandra Bose Eyre Coote Mahatma Gandhi Bangladesh Liberation War Seven Years' War Company rule in India Muslim League Franco-Prussian War Shah Alam II East Bengal (province) Rajput World War I Battle of Waterloo Military history of the United States The Manchester Regiment Trench warfare Commander-in-Chief, India Battle of Kursk United States House of Representatives British Raj English Civil War 8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot World War II Constitution of India Ulysses S.

what kinds of difficulties were faced by irish convicts in the early colony of australia what does this have to do with sectarianism and the church role of english ministers if you can tell me but primarily the above question please thank you firstly pretty much like anyone else the colony nearly starved in the first few years as the soil around sydney is too poor for farming then when the second fleet arrived it had been run by private contractors and many of those on the ships were dying or starving unlike those of the first which had been a british navy job with relatively few deaths and most convicts arriving in decent health the problem for some of the irish was that there were no catholic priests until some years had passed and to some extent they were discriminated against by other convicts and the marines however some of the governors like phillip the first and macquarie probably tried to reduce this as much as possible the problem for the irish was that they were predominantly catholic protestant england had very nearly been invaded in by a huge spanish fleet which had sailed with the pope's blessing for years or more england had seen the catholics in their midst and in ireland as potential traitors and their suspicions were borne out on some occasions even in the newly formed united states of america some people wished to exclude all catholics the situation of convicts varied a lot there were no gangs with people chained together except in punishment squads for those who had committed extra crimes in one case a convict arrived with his free wife on the same ship he was released into her custody and they started a business in the new town supplying ships since convict transportation continued for almost years there is no quick answer to your question policies and attitudes changed as time went by and some places were very much worse than others some of the commanders must have been nearly psychopathic when you read of norfolk island and macquarie harbour on the other hand the main prison at port arthur had central heating and a small private cottage was built for a political convict who i think was irish you probably would have to do a lot of reading to get to the reality of this and not take the first book you read as being the final word robert hughes the fatal shore has a lot of good stuff in it but he puts a bleak spin on a good deal of it  Arthur Phillip Sydney Elizabeth I of England Norfolk Island History of Australia before 1901 History of Ireland Parliament of the United Kingdom Eamon de Valera Second Battle of the Atlantic Irish Republicanism Spanish Armada Sinn F__in Constitution of Ireland Philip Gidley King Lachlan Macquarie Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II British monarchy Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu Capital punishment History of the United Kingdom Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Australia Irish Confederate Wars Australian English Unionists (Ireland) Crime in Australia Provisional Irish Republican Army Separation of church and state HMS Sirius (1786) Roman Catholic Church Appeal Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead Northern Ireland Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus British Empire Nine Years War (Ireland) Aubrey-Maturin series Plantations of Ireland Timeline of Australian history History of Melbourne Civil rights Same-sex marriage in Canada Theory of conduct Confederate Ireland Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom Humphrey Gilbert Irish Civil War Jacobitism Fianna F__il Irish Free State Philip II of Spain Unreformed House of Commons Williamite war in Ireland Mary I of England William Balmain Vichy France Royal Ulster Constabulary The Influence of Sea Power upon History Henry VIII of England Irish Canadian Anglo-Irish War Battle of Trafalgar Third English Civil War Sydney Hospital John of England USS Wyoming (BB-32) History of Singapore Colonial America Northern Ireland peace process John Wycliffe Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford Norwegian Campaign About-Picard law Sectarianism History of Adelaide Royal Assent Convictism in Western Australia Capital punishment in the United States History of Northern Ireland USS Missouri (BB-63) Maritimes John Henry Cardinal Newman Freedom of speech USS William B.

how did christianity affect the institutional development of europe by ad well dang maybe i can give you a few starting points but this is a big topic th century the peace of god encourages knights to stop fighting one another and work to protect the church this was during european feudalism knights belonged to lords and lords fought each other a lot the peace of god helped transfer power away from individual lords and into the church hospitallers and templars warrior monks they also owned huge amounts of capital from taxes i think the sanction of the pope was a big contested issue in medieval government did popes have to sanction secular government decisions ex the investiture conflict who appoints bishops within the kingdom the king or the pope the hundred years war th th centuries does the pope declare whether a land if a colony a sovereign nation a duchy etc or can the secular authorities decide the secular folks disagreed here and we get two major popes for a while christmas ad the pope crowns charlemagne the holy roman emperor and thereby the papal office assumes the right to crown secular rulers crusade starting past that's complicated but it makes kingdoms unstable as counts and then kings depart to fight they use it as a tool to one up each other particularly over the issue of england and france the hundred years war oh pope decrees that anyone taking up the cross fighting for the church on an official mission gains complete absolution of sins that's big monastaries education books census all kept here the domesday book is a famous census secular clergy bishops priests etc who collected taxes and owned a great deal of wealth and land held a great deal of power and monastic clergy usually a good deal poorer well that's all that's on my head for now are you in australia or africa because this sounds like school work well good luck  Pope Avignon Papacy State Investiture Controversy Holy Roman Empire History of Europe Separation of church and state British monarchy History of Germany John Wycliffe Crusade Roman Catholic Church First Crusade Henry VIII of England Bishop Papal States Protestant Reformation Eastern Orthodox Church William II of England Second Crusade Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Gallicanism Appeal Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor Royal Assent Roman Catholicism's links with political authorities Thirteen Years' War Reconquista Counter-Reformation Vatican City History of the British constitution Emperor Teutonic Knights Louis XIV of France Catholicism Second Vatican Council Monastery Martin Luther Hundred Years' War Clergy Middle Ages Democracy Knights Templar 1270s Otto von Bismarck Late Middle Ages Christianity Lord Chancellor Abbot History of Christianity Monarch History of Poland (966-1385) Religious pluralism Parliament of the United Kingdom Opus Dei Feudalism Cathedral Pope Gregory VII Franks Charles I of England Thirty Years' War Tax Pope Pius X Knights Hospitaller Peasants' War Bernard of Clairvaux Medieval Croatian state History of the Netherlands Peace and Truce of God Albigensian Crusade Unam sanctam Military history of France France in the Middle Ages Ordination of women History of anti-Semitism John of England Prince-elector Anglicanism Tithe High Middle Ages Old Swiss Confederacy Pope Benedict XVI Ecumenical council Papal Tiara Hussite Wars Jan Hus Coronation of the British monarch Manuel I Comnenus George III of the United Kingdom East-West Schism Byzantine Empire

how did christianity affect the spiritual development of europe this period of history has several stages first what happens is the decline and fall of rome or what was known as the city of caesars another stage concerns the national history of the jews the appearance of jesus in the middle of a jewish insurrection against roman colonialism and the eventual impact of his teachings during this period greek roman civilization began to be fused with germanic institutions and ideas during this period of cultural fusion the christian church furthered this process that would lead to the important cultural achievements of the europ http www emayzine com lectures christrome htm the victory of christianity as the official and only tolerated religion of the empire coincided chronologically with the beginning of the mass invasion of the germans into the western empire in fact many of the germans had been converted to christianity before their invasion of western europe however mere conversion had not effected any marked transformation of germanic cultural values for that a long process of education would be necessary in the case of christianity a simple narrative of what happened is virtually impossible jesus gave his message to jews a civilized people living in a highly complex society created by interaction among greeks romans and oriental peoples on one of the strategic highways of the world the message was carried to speculative and argumentative greeks to disciplined and civilized or enslaved and impoverished romans to partially romanized and civilized celts in gaul and britain to the wild irish and to other barbarians outside the boundaries of the civilized world http mars wnec edu grempel courses wc lectures christianity html this religion was at odds with the roman pagan beliefs and was going to cause a lot of disruption and changes to the roman way of life the followers of this religion had influenced the roman rulers and had persuaded many of them to adopt christian ways along with this came the death of valentinian in he was the last of the emperors who had revived the roman empire to it s former glory considering these two events together the empire was set to decline to a state from which it would never recover valentinian s sons gratian and valentinian ii were installed as co emperors their first action was to remove maximus who as mostly useless as governor of britain and replaced him with ausonius the appointments throughout the empire demonstrated the trend now to return power the aristocracy and bring them in closer contact with the imperial court this also brought to the fore the effect of christianity on the roman world by the appointment of those who were sympathetic to the cause http www romans in britain org uk his raids and christianity htm http www ccs k va us teachers chs cprather jesus doc the rise of christianity offers an examination of early christian history from the perspective of a sociologist of religion the result is a work of mixed effectiveness often interesting and insightful but also neglectful of crucial social aspects of emergent christianity stark's theoretical model is based on market behavior analogues and rational choice behavior modeling writing of martyrs he states individuals chose their actions rationally including those actions which concern compensators p a compensator being a method for explaining how a desired reward is to be achieved according to stark compensators involve rewards that are long delayed and may never appear for maintaining certain behaviors over periods of time stark regards this as a scientific antidote to the claim that people perform bizarre acts like martyrdom because religion is irrational stark instead builds a rational and testable model of behavior which shows that it might well be rational to prefer martyrdom http michaelturton blogspot com book review rodney stark rise of html  Sociocultural evolution Byzantine

what did the south think would happen to the western territories they seceded from the union if there had been no war and they had been allowed to secede did they plan on claiming some of the land in the west or would the have been content with what existed in the seceding states did anyone even think about it at the time did the south know that the north would fight a war to preserve the union well it was the reality of the western lands that prompted the crisis in the first place the south had worked the constitutional convention and made sure that any treaty required majority vote in the senate if you look at the original states that means to block a majority also known as a super majority all the south needed was states to vote against a treaty how many slave holding states were there at the time south carolina georgia north carolina virginia maryland thus the south could block any trade treaty that threatened the economic viability of the plantation slavery system when new states came into the union starting with the louisiana purchase the balance of slave states to free states must remain or the south was in danger of losing their ability to block a treaty in the senate now couple this reality with the fact that the plantation system had reached its geographic limits and you have a real problem if you are a pro slavery southern person there is no reason for any of the new western states to be slave states since the plantation system will not work in their type of geography so any new state made from the west will only be slave states because the south forces it to be a slave state they cannot rely on these forced slave states to vote in the solid block necessary to stop anti slavery trade treaties thus the south did not want anything to do the future movement west they neither wanted or cared what happened to the western provinces after they succeeded since they would not naturally be slave territories and part of the plantation system remember slavery was a means to an economic end the plantation system even if kansas was a slave state they could never be part of the plantation system and thus would be an unwanted appendage on the confederate states of america had they won the war as for the last part did the south think the north would fight the leaders thought it likely that the north would make a show of force but they never believed that the north would expend much blood and treasure over the battle remember the states rights arguments were about the right to have slaves they never believed that there was enough passion in the north to fight a bloody war to free the slaves in fact lincoln stayed far away from that rhetoric himself he called it a war to preserve the union and only after the north was fully committed the war effort did he break out the emancipation proclamation and change the moral tenor of the war rhetoric hope this helps good luck  Slavery Emancipation Proclamation Slave state Southern United States Border states (Civil War) Origins of the American Civil War United States History of the United States History of the United States Constitution Midwestern United States History of the United States (1789-1849) United States Senate Robert E.

would germany have won the war if they hadnt invaded russia if i reemmber right germany and the soviet union actually were allies in the 's and there was a military pact both would invade poland but the agreement stood that neither would then interfere with the other germany would have free shot at western europe and russia would stay out of the war this pact ended when germany needing oil invaded the ukraine so lets say germany never invaded russia and russia stayed neutral or at least from the europe war that would mean the only threat to germany was britian which was barely holding out untill the united states finally entered the war and whatever else allies from the west could germany have won the war i reckon they could have done also another vital mistake they made was calling off the bombing of the raf camps to attack random towns in revenge for our bombings this allowed the raf to regain it's strength and m ller the germans  Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact World War II Participants in World War II Western betrayal History of Poland European Theatre of World War II Luftwaffe Allies of World War II Winter War Operation Barbarossa NATO Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Eastern Front (World War II) Continuation War History of Poland (1918-1939) History of the Soviet Union (1927-1953) Soviet Union Axis Powers Polish-Soviet War History of Poland (1939-1945) Battle of Britain Katy__ massacre World War I Occupation of Baltic Republics History of Lithuania Timeline of World War II Joseph Stalin History of Germany during World War II Cold War (1947-1953) and its origins RAF Bomber Command Norwegian Campaign Napoleonic Wars Warsaw Pact Strategic bombing German reunification Former countries in Europe after 1815 Strategic bombing during World War II Military history of the Soviet Union League of Nations Russia Tripartite Pact Appeasement History of Europe End of World War II in Europe Battle of the Bulge History of Germany since 1945 Cold War History of Austria Military alliance Romania during World War II Causes of World War II Munich Agreement W__adys__aw Sikorski Eastern Question Blitzkrieg History of Belarus Prussia Curzon Line Iron Curtain Royal Air Force Treaty of Versailles Oder-Neisse line Poland Military history of Germany History of Estonia Operation Weser__bung Suez Crisis Joachim von Ribbentrop Military history of the United States Finlandization Battle of France Vichy France Yalta Conference Nazi Germany Aftermath of the Polish-Soviet War Red Army Adolf Hitler Eastern Europe Berlin Wall Russo-Japanese War Occupation of Denmark Leon Trotsky Anti-communism Germany History of the British Army Red Army Faction Archery at the 2004 Summer Olympics History of Germany History of the Jews in Poland J__zef Pi__sudski Berlin Blockade Greco-Italian War

how did martin luther view copernicus and how long did calvin view copernicus for ap euro summer work this is from the book a world lit only by fire by william manchester for an ap euro class please answer if you are taking ap euro if you're asking what manchester says about luther calvin's view it's been years since i read the book you mention but i'm rather clear he was highly critical of these men but not on a very solid basis in other words he was quick to accept legends and caricatures i recall manchester's views to be something on the order of the popular but patently false claim that columbus's opponents in the church thought the world was flat in fact they all believed it to be spherical only his critics thought it larger than he did in fact they were correct on that point unfortunately some of the main sources quoted on these matters are people who wrote with a strong anti religious bias esp andrew white who helped spread the columbus story without ever checking his facts or those who rely on them e g sadly thomas kuhn the source of the case student's blog entries cited in another answer as for what luther and calvin really thought about copernicus neither of them ever made any official statement about copernicus's theories luther's only comments were offhand remarks made around his dinner table in and recorded variously by his students it's clear copernicus was involved since that very year university of wittenberg mathematics professor georg joachim rheticus went to visit copernicus to learn from him and eventually bring c's major work on the revolutions of the heavenly spheres to press as c was on his deathbed note again the date that is four years before copernicus's magnum opus was published there was some knowledge of his views in the scholarly community but most did not learn much about them until after rheticus's efforts for which he has been dubbed the first copernican copernicus's system was in the mid th century still very short on data it was not until tycho brahe's detailed observations and the work of johannes kepler that the theory could be firmly established newton's work on gravity was also an important ingredient also since copernicus still believed the planetary motions to be circular kepler first argued for elliptical paths his theories were not as simple and clear as what we now know as the copernican system epicycles for example still played an important part i'm posting links to a couple of solid articles one on luther one on calvin that gives you a better idea of what they did and didn't say again neither attempted a scholarly attack on it in particular they did not argue that this view or theories like it would undermine or contradict scripture for that matter when they did speak on the role of science and its connection to scripture they took a very open view and both took the general position that scripture's language about the natural world was phenomenological that is it simply reflected common sense observation how things look from ordinary daily human experience and did not necessarily teach us exactly how the physical world operates modern day example we still speak of sunrise and sunset http www leaderu com science kobe html http www nd edu mdowd postings calvinastrorev html  Giordano Bruno Science Creationism Isaac Newton Postmodernism Falsifiability History of physics Physics Occam's Razor Hipparchus (astronomer) Age of Enlightenment Geocentric model Solar system Plame affair History of creationism Scientific method Apocrypha Young Earth creationism Creation-evolution controversy Cosmology Philosophy of mathematics Supernatural Religion Logic Scientific skepticism History of astronomy Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Cultural relativism Philosophy of science New Testament Kepler's laws of planetary motion Quantum mechanics History of astrology Existence of God Protestant Reformation John Wycliffe Philosophy of language Planetary orbit Reality Martin Heidegger Intelligent design movement Biblical canon Causality Scientology beliefs and practices Predestination A Course In Miracles History of Western philosophy Meaning of life Sociocultural evolution Economics Ludwig Wittgenstein Astrology Teach the Controversy Epistemology Deconstruction Determinism Cognitive science General relativity Creation science Mathematics Georg Joachim Rheticus Angel Fundamentalism Atheism Ptolemaic system Social sciences Theory Big Bang Calvinism Black hole Anti-intellectualism Aberration of light Bah__'__ Faith and Science Open access Doomsday argument John Dee Alchemy Protestantism Pseudoscience

why is monmouth battlefield not part of the national parks system shouldn't the site of the largest battle for american independence be part of our nsp it often depends on how the park or organization recieves funding it also depends on whom owns and opperates it monmouth battlefield park is part of the new jersey state park service which means it is operated by local state government whereas other national state parks such as minute man national historic park in mass is funded and operated by the federal government sate vs national parks often are staffed differnetly as well state vs national parks have different restrictions as well specifics get complicated i am unsure though if monmouth recieves federal government funding it depends on location  National Park Service National park Monmouth County, New Jersey State Politics of the United States American Revolutionary War Federal government of the United States United States Government of France Elections in the United States Hudson-Bergen Light Rail American Red Cross Crown dependency Fraternities and sororities Canadian House of Commons Tax Gettysburg Battlefield Federal Reserve Political divisions of the United States Non-governmental organization Protected areas of the United States Northeast Corridor Monmouth Rebellion Miami-Dade County, Florida Policy Debate New Jersey Congressional Districts Fredericksburg, Virginia Campaign finance in the United States Monetary policy Publicly funded medicine Federation Public transport Amtrak International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement Northern Ontario Caltrain Taxation in the United States Air traffic control National Register of Historic Places Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ancient warfare National Weather Service US health reform under Truman Credit union Bay Area Rapid Transit National Natural Landmark Washington Metro Cable television Colorado Naming the American Civil War Canadian National Railway Nigeria Shiloh National Military Park Washington National Cathedral Government of India Independent Subway System National parks of England and Wales Militia Union Pacific Railroad Tribal sovereignty United States territory Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority Same-sex marriage Public education Separation of powers UK telephone numbering plan Confederacy of Independent Systems Monmouth, Oregon Canadian and American politics compared Catskill State Park James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth International law Search and rescue Battle of Gettysburg Public broadcasting Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Appalachian Trail Battle of Pea Ridge Housing cooperative North American Numbering Plan Church in Wales Public Broadcasting Service Emergency Medical Services Grand Forks, North Dakota United States Department of the Interior United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company Jersey Shore Constitution Social Security (United States) Freedom of information legislation Librarian U.S. Wilderness Area Minnesota Public Radio Minimum wage Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument United States Army Hybrid vehicle Battle of Champion Hill Immigration to the United States

a jfk avengement could be given now that it is clear whom assasinated him and rfk and dr king would it be morally right to do this from the streets eye an eye since our own govt won't pursue these selfish murderers and that means anyone still connected to them today understanding most of them are either dead or too old to do anything but wait while they worry what their fate is for committing the act o k what if their club still exists now there mr buddy rabbit would it be morally right interesting there marguerite and i wouldn't argue with a scholar at least not today though i will say that those affected by the late jfk's words are admirers of hope and faith for a system that has been failing u s since his assasination and the obvious secret societies existing are possibly bringing the country into a dark age filled with greed and disharmony i am beginning to believe the only thing that will bring those people to our level is the idea that their fate is no different than our own so to be or not to be if that is the question what is the answer it is well known who is responsible all the info is at the touch of a keyboard some outlandish most true from hunt to rockafellr and then some it's all highly understandable with all the info available when it comes to those abusing the rights and power handed down by our ancestors whom fought for this land i do advocate vigilante justice against those that try to undermine it it seems there is no other justice since the rich run the judicial system leaving aside the wild conspiracy theories it seems likely that the assassination of jfk was a mob hit the man who actually did it died a couple of years ago in prison in france however which individual s actually ordered it is not known and it is likely that he they are deceased at this point regardless of who the victim was what you are advocating is vigilante justice this exists in the middle east on a large scale suicide bombings car bombs outside restaurants etc and in the inner cities of most major cities in the form of gang wars and the result is unrest and distress for the whole social spectrum whether personally involved or not the mark of civilized societies is that people do not take the law into their own hands but have a legal process that must be followed admittedly it sometimes fails but it is still a much better system than the upheaval that follows as a result of the self righteous gunning down the perceived perpetrator in the street if jfk was the person his worshippers seem to believe i would think vigilante justice is the not what he would want  Assassination Theory of conduct Capital punishment Murder Goodness and value theory Coercion Rape Same-sex marriage Civil rights Democracy Classified information Social justice Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Religion Government of India Altruism Liberalism Theodicy Ethics Sexual orientation Christianity Evil Abortion debate Fathers' rights Meme Consensual crime Paul of Tarsus Cultural relativism Objectivist philosophy Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Left-wing politics State Yusuf al-Qaradawi Summa Theologiae Freedom of speech Scientology beliefs and practices Lynching in the United States Non-aggression principle Noam Chomsky Terrorism Robert F.

president richard nixon i know this is an issue filled with a great deal of anger but did nixon get a raw deal i know that he screwed up but he also was perhaps the greatest foreign policy president we've ever had plus he was the one who got us out of vietnam no one seems to remember that kennedy and johnson got us in did he get a raw deal hmmmm every nation 'needs' its villains and nixon fit the bill actually if one truly studies the calibre of men who have inhabited the white house one walks away with a cold chill although many of his observations irk me gee i like harry s truman the views of gore vidal on the subject of presidents ought to be studied how different would the world be if incumbent president nixon duked it out with that upstart kennedy in with the resources of the white house behind him nixon may have won and maybe just maybe the paranoia and arrogance that festered for a decade might not have made him resort to such clumsy tactics as those that ensured his downfall actually as vice president nixon was a star he took the office far from its status as a backwater and modern vps such as mondale and gore owe nixon a great deal of grattitude we won't talk about chaney that would be rude though nixon did 'get america' out of vietnam a lot of that is due to kissinger actually nixon wasn't a good team player and that too did him in oddly enough what did nixon in what the most honorable thing he did he resigned he stepped down instead of submitting ameria to a nasty bloodbath under the capitol dome a process that could have consumed a year maybe two and left the republican party in ruins nixon left the room got in the presidential helicopter and flew away but doing the right thing is what gave everyone the 'right' to say see he had to have done it he quit his actions were accepted as proof of evil venality a raw deal perhaps but then as was said america needs its villains where would historians be if they couldn't kick harding and nixon around especially when one considers that james buchanan was the worst president america has had to endure http www huffingtonpost com gore vidal president jonah b html peace ps fdr was the greatest foreign policy president and a lot can be argued for reagan and eisenhower and clinton all of whom utilized brilliant secretary of states pss nixon was trhe most fascinating person of the s a failure in and a victor in and an appearence on laugh in  Richard Nixon Republican Party (United States) American liberalism Lyndon B.

why did the american public believed nixon should have been removed from office after the watergate scandal no one knows what if any involvement nixon had in the watergate break in my own feeling is that he was far too shrewd a politician to become involved in anything of the sort especially as he was unquestionably headed for a landslide in at the same time he definitely attempted to cover up the indisputable involvement of high level members of his administration including his attorney general and top white house aides to do this he lied under oath of course another recent president did that too but it is arguable that attempting to subvert the electoral process is more significant than sexual misconduct however vile it is by no means clear that the majority of the american public believed nixon should be removed from office but he likely would have been it is to his credit that he resigned rather than enlarge the scandal in the midst of national turmoil  Watergate scandal President of the United States Democratic Party (United States) John Dean W.

what does the french indian enemies had been sold arms by albany entrepreneurs loyal onlytotheir ledger books i'm doing american history at uni and came across this in the text book does it mean to sell ammunitions by albany to the french indians thanks you are likely referring to the french and indian war where the french and the indians were allies against the british and colony residents if so this 'could' meant that some in albany who were part of the british and colonies sold arms to the enemies french and indians simply to make money adding to the assets of their ledger books without regard to the fact that they were abetting the enemies of the british and colonials is this true i don't know for sure but it could be and the reason may not be as simple as the question and my answer imply in the border regions and albany could be considered as border loyalties were mixed as they were in the ensuing revolution  American Revolutionary War American Revolution Saratoga Campaign War of 1812 Military history of Canada French colonial empires Benedict Arnold Colonial America History of the United States (1776-1789) History of Canada Pontiac's Rebellion Military history of the United States Upstate New York Spanish Civil War France Ohio Country Colonial Militia in Canada Patriotism Indian Wars French Canadian French and Indian War Clef Halifax, Nova Scotia War of the Pacific British East India Company Napoleonic Wars Pensacola, Florida European influence in Afghanistan French colonisation of the Americas Minutemen (militia) Nation-state Tadeusz Ko__ciuszko 8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot Albany Congress Peter Gansevoort Labor theory of value Illinois Country Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 World War II Law of value History of New York Atlantic slave trade Sullivan Expedition Constitutional history of Canada Total war British Army Quebec Eastern Townships James II of England Niagara County, New York Government of India Act 1935 British Raj Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Indian Army African American History of Malaysia Creole Languages in the United States Capital accumulation Military history of France British Isles (terminology) Tet Offensive Transcontinental nation Chautauqua County, New York Japanese American internment Participants in World War II French Revolutionary Wars Caribbean French fries New Caledonia Albany County, New York Frontier Dutch colonization of the Americas First Indochina War History of Cape Colony from 1806 to 1870 Double-entry book-keeping Primitive accumulation of capital RISC UN Security Council Resolution 242 Canada Scots Guards World War I Surplus value Weapon Annexation Chief Pontiac Cattaraugus County, New York Springfield, Massachusetts Thirteen Colonies Military history of Italy during World War II Rum Democratic peace theory Constitution of India History of Ohio Expert system Nova Scotia History of the United States (1789-1849) The Duke of Wellington's Regiment Military history of the Soviet Union History of Quebec

why did china lose its edge in shipbuilding technology because this edge did not serve any commercial interests it rested on two pillars admiral zheng he and financial support given to him by the emperors of ming dynasty zheng's missions resulted mostly in establishing diplomatic relations with faraway countries and exchange of royal gifts such as zebras and giraffes for the imperial gardens and were unbelievably costly his fleet at its height included ships and men zheng died during his last expedition so there was no one else to lobby for maintenance and expansion of the fleet partly because zheng being a muslim was always somewhat of an outsider in court moreover many courtiers thought that private long distance sea travel should be discouraged just as any other contact with foreign lands and by no ship with two or more masts could leave a chinese port without government permission sailing a large ship without a permit became a capital offense  Zheng He Ming Dynasty Junk (ship) Qing Dynasty Imperialism in Asia Joseon Dynasty Wokou Tokugawa shogunate History of China Qin Shi Huang China Koxinga Silk Road Kangxi Emperor Yongle Emperor Han Dynasty Fuzhou Beijing Manchukuo Sino-Roman relations William Adams History of Taiwan 1421 hypothesis Nanjing Zhang Qian Fujian Taiwan Battleship Seven-Year War Nanjing University Emperor Guangwu of Han Senkaku Islands Yi Sun-sin USS Alden (DD-211) Xiongnu Ship History of Buddhism Muromachi period Emperor He of Han Ayutthaya kingdom Emperor Navy Sidney Smith (admiral) Aircraft carrier Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited First Sino-Japanese War Battle of Jutland Republic of China Ottoman Empire Viking Age Tribute British East India Company Louis XIV of France Japanese poetry Emperor Wu of Han USS Pennsylvania (BB-38) Parthia Sindbad the Sailor War of the Austrian Succession Xuande Emperor Sino-American relations Yuan Dynasty Henan Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact People's Republic of China War of the Pacific Buddhist art Foreign relations of imperial China Qin Dynasty Traditional Chinese law Nara period Jiangsu History of Japan Zhuge Liang Shi Lang Karachi Revolt of the Three Feudatories Sino-Japanese relations Military history of China Spratly Islands Emperor Ming of Han Glossary of nautical terms Vasco da Gama Second Opium War Bodhidharma Russian history, 1892-1920 USS Valley Forge (CV-45) Galley History of Vietnam USS Whipple (DD-217) Eastern Question Vancouver History of Macau Christopher Columbus HMS Victory

russia usa and uk in ww having just done a discussion on ww and the part the allies played one person pointed out the contribution the russians made they quoted the numbers on each side and it appears the russians gave many many more lives than the western allies however some people have suggested that this credits the soviets as the main protaganists the main victors i hypothesis that the poor equiptment training conditions and organisation caused these deaths and as russia has such a huge populations these men were fodder to the machine guns until they got a bit better equipt usa and uk on the other hand were never invaded and therefore used our superior resources to strategically strike this i believe means that although russia got to berlin faster the bombing by the uk and usa meant it was a reasonably easier route so i still believe you can accredate the spoils equally probably weighted in favour of the uk and usa i hav debated this point in depth with my partner as she has the opposite view she is russian and learned soviet history as opposed to my uk history which are sometimes very different i agree with your assessment however the red army would've reached berlin just the same with or without the western allies the numbers were simply overwhelming consider deaths on both sides eastern front stalingrad million siege of leningrad million moscow smolensk kiev vorenesh belarus nd rzhev sychevka caucasus kursk lower dnieper kongsberg rostov budapest and others with less killed whereas on the western front battle of france normandy el alamein battle of the bulge not even on the same scale do the math  World War II Battle of Kursk Operation Barbarossa Army Group Centre Hero City Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Blitzkrieg Battle of the Bulge Timeline of World War II Polish September Campaign Polish-Soviet War Erich von Manstein Georgy Zhukov Population transfer in the Soviet Union History of Germany during World War II Winter War Russia Soviet Union Military history of the Soviet Union T-34 Operation Saturn Luftwaffe World War I Red Army W__adys__aw Sikorski Continuation War Russian Revolution of 1917 Napoleonic Wars Smolensk Kiev Offensive (1920) Katy__ massacre Muscovy Battle of Berlin German 1st Fallschirmj__ger Division Battle of Normandy Participants in World War II History of Ukraine Western Front (World War II) Napoleon's Invasion of Russia Russian Civil War Lavrenty Beria Semyon Timoshenko History of Europe Military history of Germany Battle of Warsaw (1920) Battle of France Russian history, 1892-1920 Burma Campaign M4 Sherman T-72 War of the Austrian Succession RAF Bomber Command History of Poland (1939-1945) Left communism Pale of Settlement Ivan Konev History of Polish Intelligence Services Battle of Moscow Grossdeutschland Division Russian Orthodox Church Joseph Stalin Politics of Russia Polish-Muscovite War (1605-1618) Tunisia Campaign Trench warfare Vladimir Lenin Konstantin Rokossovsky Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler Bombing of Dresden in World War II Franco-Prussian War NATO Axis and Allies Politics of Belarus Grand Duchy of Lithuania SS Division Totenkopf Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim History of Belarus Panzer Corps Feldherrnhalle Kievan Rus' Anti-communism Russian language First Indochina War Western betrayal Europe Moscow Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein Orange Revolution SS Division (motorised) Wiking Chernobyl accident

why didn't the allies reverse engineer the german mm gun if the allies feared the wouldn't it make sense to copy a captured example and then deploy it against the germans the german mm proved so devastating to allied tanks that there was indeed debate at the time about reverse engineering it the reasons why that never happened seem to boil down to a the mm at least in its early versions wasn't actually as good an aa gun than the british inch aa nor than the american mm moreover on the few occasions when they were employed in a ground to ground role including at fire against panzers those guns proved very effective indeed b so from an artillery engineering perspective the german mm really wasn't enything special and certainly did not warrant the disruption to allied manufacturing production lines that would have been involved in producing copies of it in reality the mm got its well deserved reputation as an at super gun not because it was so very much better than anything that the allies had but because the wehrmacht used it so much more intelligently as early as in the western desert british tank men began crying out for the deployment of heavy at guns in the same way as the afrika korps was using the mm they even got the ear of winston churchill himself in october churchill stated that auchinleck's th army hoped 'to deploy over heavy mobile anti aircraft guns exclusive of those in tobruk and he wrote a memo to his generals saying every mobile aa gun should carry a plentiful supply of solid armour piercing tracer shot suggesting that they use the in the same way that the germans used the mm all to no avail the horrible truth is that the german army was much more adept at tactical combined arms integration than the allies rommel and others understood very well how to coordinate mobile panzers with much less mobile at guns allied generals ok just possibly excepting patton did not manage to do that effectively even if the allies had exact copies of the mm they would probably have failed to use it effectively for more on this topic i commend the following websites and forums  World War II Battle of France Military history of Egypt during World War II M4 Sherman Tank classification Battle of Normandy Armoured warfare Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Polish September Campaign Battle of the Bulge Tiger I Tunisia Campaign Anti-aircraft warfare Panzer I Battle of the Kasserine Pass Tank Panzer II Battle of Gazala Scots Guards (1914) Norwegian Campaign German armoured fighting vehicles of World War II Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein Tank destroyer German 33rd Infantry Division Patton tank Battle of Kursk Operation Barbarossa Operation Market Garden T-34 Ammunition Operation Crusader European Theatre of World War II History of the British Army Richard O'Connor Erich von Manstein British Commandos Trench warfare History of the tank Deutsches Afrikakorps Panther tank Special Air Service United States Marine Corps Panzer 38(t) Irish Guards Operation Torch Technology during World War II Battle of Berlin Operation Battleaxe British Home Guard Artillery Indian Army P-51 Mustang British Army MS-06 Zaku II 2nd Canadian Infantry Division M60 machine gun Ultra Brandenburgers Structure of the British Army Battle of Mokra German Panzer Lehr Division Airborne forces Eastern Front (World War II) Chindits Panzer IV Battlefield 2 Churchill tank Battle of the Somme (1916) Claude Auchinleck Battle of Debrecen Mechanized infantry B-24 Liberator First day on the Somme German Army Luftwaffe Allied invasion of Sicily German Panzer Army Afrika Anti-tank M3 Lee Western Desert Campaign History of Poland (1939-1945) Dieppe Raid North African Campaign Battle of Kock (1939) Mark I (tank) Panzer III V-1 flying bomb Burma Campaign 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend Gulf War Royal Air Force Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign Kamenets-Podolsky Pocket

when fdr became president one of the first things he did to restore confidence in the economy was was it the bank holiday where he closed down all the bank or was it the welfare program creating jobs for the people one would have to cite the bank holiday since it was a 'dramatic' gesture a lot of flash fire nothing truly concrete accomplished but mainly a show of power actually when one thinks about closing down banks it is not a reassuring sign but rosevelt planted the idea in most everyone's mind that by closing the banks for a brief while would somehow allow time to reorganize actually what fdr did to shore up the economy was accomplished with less flash fire by pushing thrugh lesislation that freed up funding for several federal work not welfare but work projects what is amusing for a man in a wheelchair is the fact that fdr was a lot like that nice guy who stops and helps to push your car out of the mud or ice the sheer vitality of fdr's actions as oppossed to hoover's paralyzed stance restored public confidence fdr simply had the knack of making it seen as if things would be done and to his credit he followed through closing the banks was a visible symbol but what put the economy back on track were the measures fdr pushed through congress during the vaunted 'hundred days ' http www huppi com kangaroo first days htm fdr's natural air of confidence and optimism did much to reassure the nation his inauguration on march occurred literally in the middle of a terrifying bank panic hence the backdrop for his famous words the only thing we have to fear is fear itself the very next day to prevent a run on banks he declared a bank holiday closing all banks indefinitely until bankers and government could regain control of the situation the term holiday was meant to give a festive air to what was actually a desperate situation but such was fdr's desire to provide hope to the nation congress was almost entirely compliant and gave the president everything he wanted the emergency banking bill which strengthened reorganized and reopened the most solvent banks was passed overwhelmingly by congress with little debate on march roosevelt announced that the soundest banks would reopen on march deposits at those banks exceeded withdrawals a tremendous relief to a worried nation capitalism was saved in eight days said raymond moley a member of the president's brain trust the bank holiday was a vivid example of the effectiveness of government intervention in an economic crisis hoover had allowed two previous bank panics to run their course which contributed to over bank failures and billion in lost deposits the bank holiday secured roosevelt's political reputation and convinced both congress and the public that the new deal was the right road to follow roosevelt's strategy consisted of two parts first provide relief for those who needed it most which often involved a redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor second provide long lasting reform to the nation's economy through reorganization and the creation of new agencies most of roosevelt's policies can be described as taking from one pocket to put in the other fixated with a balanced budget and fretful when it was not roosevelt made sure that anything given to one sector of the economy was taken from somewhere else he did not accept keynes' recommendation to begin heavy deficit spending and did not do so until the threat of world war ii forced him to roosevelt's legendary first days concentrated on the first part of his strategy immediate relief from march to june fdr sent congress a record number of bills all of which passed easily these included the creation of the federal emergency relief administration the civilian conservation corps the reconstruction finance corporation and the tennessee valley authority congress also gave the federal trade commission broad new regulatory powers and provided mortgage relief to millions of farmers and homeowners the success of the first days was important because it got the new deal off to a strong and early start later the conservative supreme court would declare much of the new deal unconstitutional and roosevelt's political prestige would decline as his policies failed to resolve the depression if roosevelt had not passed his agenda early we would probably be without many new deal programs we take for granted today peace  Social Security (United States) George W.
