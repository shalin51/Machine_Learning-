how do you go about doing genealogy research at a courthouse what is the procedure what do they have in there and do they just let you go in and sort through it all my experience is different from holly's the majority of court houses that i have been to will show you where the appropriate files are many times they are busy with current business and not available to help in some courthouses they are less than willing to allow access to books but it may depend on the type of record since some are not as public as others i think a lot depends on the actual size of the courthouse and their attitude towards research i have found some to show annoyance and others are cordial most of the records i have wanted to see are much older records often stored in basements or dusty rooms dress accordingly remember that their purpose is not genealogy per se there will be marriage books probate files and land records copying is usually restricted to the clerks once you find what you want  Genealogy Probation officer Password Courthouse RISC MAME Computer Computer virus Copiah County, Mississippi Las Vegas, Nevada NTFS File system Legal research Trademark Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Appeal Public domain Mach kernel Expert system Library (computer science) Census Backup Easement Same-sex marriage in Canada Appomattox Court House Hampton Roads System/36 Malware New Hampshire Supreme Court Fair dealing Cosmic dust Mineral County, West Virginia Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana Romney, West Virginia Patent Scientology beliefs and practices Temple (Mormonism) Publishing Linked list Redundant array of independent disks CPU cache Courtroom Battle of Appomattox Courthouse House of Lords Albany Academy Same-sex marriage in the United States Library File sharing Copyleft Tort reform Basement Copyright law of the United Kingdom ITunes File Allocation Table Usenet Memory Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Forth programming language Book of Mormon Copyright Something Awful Forums Hash table Trinity College, Dublin Abortion Librarian Robert Byrd Floppy disk Taunton, Massachusetts Master Control Program Xenu Canadian House of Commons Virtual memory Ministry of Magic Excommunication System/34 Laboratory Bristol Grammar School Spring operating system Divorce XML Battery (electricity) Royal Assent Intellectual property Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Open access Windows 2000 Software license Rainey Bethea Reverse engineering Urban sprawl ROC presidential election, 2004 Life extension Animal Crossing I Want to Hold Your Hand C plus plus Wallpaper group Bankruptcy United States Postal Service Restoring the Lost Constitution Marketing research

why are ukrainian names such as iwanonkiw spelt with a w instead of a v since the cyrilic does not have a w do you think that when these people came to canada or us the immigration made the error if one exists also does someone know what part of ukraine these names are more present iwanonkiw osipenko laholy there are two possibilities immigration misspelled the name or made it americanized this was very common in early immigration days pre 's where a name woiuld be americanized to make it easier for english speakers to pronounce this is no longer done at least by us canadian immigration they are actually of polish decent where the w is very common which would indicate that they immigrated from the far west of ukraine liviv etc in your iwanonivw example i would see ivanon as being more likely for a ukranian patronimic name but the ending of kiv would be unusual for patronimic name osipenko would be a russian surname but not with the laholy laholy isn't russian ukrainian and they do not hypenate their names that would be an american thing by marriage  Russian language Ukrainian language Ukraine Cyrillic alphabet Ruthenia Family name Polish language Galicia (Central Europe) Slovak language Romanization Former countries in Europe after 1815 Belarusian language Romanization of Ukrainian Ukrainian presidential election, 2004 Non-native pronunciations of English Etymology of Rus and derivatives Leet Bessarabia Ukrainians Yat History of Ukraine Apostrophe (mark) Moldovan language Slavic peoples Diacritic Spelling reform West Ukrainian National Republic Bulgarian language Serbo-Croatian language Russians Kievan Rus' Ukrainian People's Republic Russian phonology Bulgarians Verkhovna Rada Kiev Republics of the Soviet Union Lemko Ukrainian alphabet Esperanto as an international language Hyphen Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church Swedish language Early Cyrillic alphabet Ukrainian Canadian Offensive terms per nationality History of Christianity in Ukraine Ruthenian language Ukrainian SSR Curzon Line Rusyns African American Vernacular English Multilingual Volyn Oblast Korean name Transnistria Canada Taras Shevchenko Greek language Lviv Oblast History of Belarus Post-election developments in Ukraine, 2004 German language Nikolai Gogol Kamianets-Podilskyi Slavic languages Old East Slavic language Anglicisation Dutch language Latin alphabet R__maji Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church Rusyn language Grammatical gender Cossack Misspelling Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact Mutually intelligible languages Russian Mafia Southern American English Georgiy R.

why are genetics questions apearing in the genealogy section is there not a science division the only reason i ask is because i can't answer genetic questions and would rather see people go to people who can in the science section lydia actually i know a great deal about genetics but this is a genealogy section while you are correct in stating that genetic makeup is important only your immediate family not strangers on a board can shed light on the specifics genealogy is about finding people in place and time thus it has more of a historical link than a scientific one knowing there's a cancer link in your family won't help you find your ancestors in if a person is new to yahoo questions and answers and a good part of our questioners are they mostly likely ask their question from the home page the yahoo system is set up to pick up certain key words and throw the question into a category now the questioner can change it before he she submits but if they are new they might not notice that we get a lot of questions on this board because of that i have seen two questions regarding a grandfather clock on this board no doubt the word grandfather caused it to come to genealogy i usually probe a person's avatar and look at their profile and the q a's they have and most of the time they are newbies are almost newbies  Genealogy Newbie Young Earth creationism Species Biology Science Genetic fingerprinting Religion Genealogical DNA test Sexual orientation Theory of conduct Neopets Noah's Ark Jumpstart 3rd Grade Francis Crick $ale of the Century Cognitive science GED Race Creationism Scientific method Killian documents Validity of human races Intelligent design Transsexuality Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Molecular evolution Plame affair Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma DNA Emperor of Japan Gravity Identity and change Evolutionism Mitochondrial Eve Lamanite Ethics History of creationism Semitic Most recent common ancestor Entropy B3ta CPU cache Human University of Utah Hearing impairment Tic-Tac-Dough Test (student assessment) Now You See It Wheel of Fortune Goodness and value theory Autism Evolution Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Time travel Muhammad Falsifiability Philosophy of mathematics Epistemology Origin belief Free will Family SmartAsk Macroevolution Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs SAT Nature versus nurture Internet troll Intelligent design movement Abraham Sociobiology Joseph Smith, Jr. G__del's incompleteness theorem Expert system Predestination paradox Paradigm Biology and sexual orientation Ashkenazi Jews Legal research Deluge (mythology) Creationist cosmologies Determinism Meme Anthropology Supernatural John Titor Human cloning Solar system Corporate personhood Western philosophy Flood geology Karl Popper AIDS reappraisal Geometry GunBound Fifteen to One Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 6 Contract Psychology

why are so many pages allowed to come up under free geneology when they all make you pay for information it seems even government sites now do not allow you to look at information without charging although they are all free this also is the same for looking up people tons of free sites but none of them allow you to actually see the information unless you pay this is false and misleading and something should be done about it i have to say i agree with you i pay a lot of money for my global package with www ancestry com there is a free trial for would be customers but what about people like me who have had this package for about two years now but i have never been offered a free month or anything like that it really annoys me  Enron Corporation United States Postal Service Internet fraud Spyware Genealogy E-mail spam Web hosting United States v.

human dna test i apologize if i'm misusing the terms hispanic or latino a i'm a year old black girl i've often been asked if i'm latina and i never really thought much of it until tonight when my aunt mom and i were looking at photos my aunt has often been asked this question too and my cousin and i have talked about the possibility of us being part dominican on my maternal grandfather's side my grandfather looks very hispanic he doesn't know what his ethnic background truly is because his mother died when he was very young and he doesn't know much about his family anyway i'm just really curious about where i or one of my family members can obtain a dna swab test so we can learn about our geneology um i want to know because i want to know about the side of my family that my grandfather never knew i want to know my true lineage wtf can't a person just be curious what's so wrong with that i knew someone was gonna take it the wrong way thanks for answering the question btw it sounds as though your grandfather is still alive so you can easily obtain a dna sample from him using a mouth swab rubbed against the inside of the cheek your grandfather will have received his y chromosome from his father and he in turn would have received it from his father following up the direct paternal line if you take a y chromosome snp test you can see which 'haplogroup' he is in and with this determine where his y chromosome comes from if you have a theory that his paternal line is of spanish or portuguese origin the test will help to prove or disprove this it is also possible to test his direct maternal line too through his mitochondrial dna mtdna he would have received this mtdna from his mother and her mother and so on again it will tell you which haplogroup he is in for that line and provide a region of origin the mtdna test is not as precise but it will differentiate well between that of african and european origin note that the tests look at direct lines so will miss out other ancestors i had both of mine tested through www dnaheritage com a while ago  Genetic genealogy Mitochondrial DNA Indo-Aryan migration Y-chromosomal Aaron Mitochondrial Eve Mulatto Mitochondrial genetics Y-chromosomal Adam Human DNA Berber Genealogy Hispanic Polymerase chain reaction Paternity testing DNA repair Blood type Family name Roma people Domestication of the horse Scientific method Family Single-origin hypothesis Negrito Jat Allan Wilson Biology and sexual orientation Biology Francis Crick Shaggy dog story Chromosome Beta Israel Haplotype Genetic fingerprinting Palestinian Meiosis Jacen Solo Calvin and Hobbes Molecular systematics Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Pitaten Genetics International HapMap Project Species Ashkenazi Jews Demographics of Argentina Bayesian inference Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Validity of human races Prenatal diagnosis X chromosome Cancer Anakin Solo Human genome Tenchi Muyo!

italian but no italian last name im italian and english i look italian people think i look italian but i have an english last name does that matter if i identify myself as italian but i have an english last name maybe of the folks who drop by the genealogy area deal with this same misconception your last name is just a label that comes from your father and it comes to him from his father grandfather so forth when thinking about your heritage background remember you have grandparents just to explain imagine that your grandfather born in england moved to france and married a french woman you are also equal parts of your mother's parents and let's assume all of them were completely french thus of of the grandparents here are actually french or fill in the blank the only one who happens to be not french is the paternal grandfather which is where the name gets passed down take that back one more generation where you have gr grandparents again all of those are individuals with their own background by this time the name becomes only th of your actual background with me so far when you start looking at all the persons who are your ancestors and who you are part of it should take just a few minutes to realize that someone's surname is only a very tiny tiny part of ancestry and of course it is always fun when someone drops by here gets intrigued and says hey i want to know how to find those ancestors and know more about who each of them were  Family Family name Genealogical DNA test Blood purity (Harry Potter) Chinese surname Maiden name Genealogy Who is a Jew?

how do i go about finding if a deceased person had a last will testament without directly asking the one person that was closest to the deceased it's part of the public record so you go to the county courthouse and get a copy if you just want to know if there is one you can call and give the name and they can tell you i've gotten wills clear back to at our courthouse and we're just a tiny area you could walk the whole county in less than a day even if they were buried or died elsewhere it has to be registered in the county they lived in at the time of death  Will (law) Funeral Japanese funeral Romney, West Virginia Death Triage Jewish bereavement Civil unions in the United Kingdom Cremation Coffin Parish register Anderson, South Carolina Burke and Wills expedition Philip J.

how do i find my grand father i grew up in canada but was born in germany my mother and father are divorced and my grandmother and grandfather also divorced when my father was i cannot get any information on my grandfather besides his first and last name no date or place or birth and no last known residence half of my family is missing i have daughters and would love to be able to let them have a family history your first replies on the question maybe don't realize that there is a genealogy section here http www cyndislist com germany htm here's a list of resources for german research it tends to historical info but at the same time networking with those sources can lead you to contacts in germany by the way cyndi's list is my favorite for all research resources not just germany i would also suggest reviewing the adoption area for ideas you don't have an adoption situation but the process and tips can be of use i think there is one location relating to german adoption although you did not specify it seems that your parents were also born in germany it can be harder to locate info on people who are alive you didn't say your age not that you should but a lot depends if it is likely that either dad or grandparents are alive without questioning reasons etc if you located dad's birth certificate it should indicate names of both grandparents in addition where they were located at time of dad's birth is a clue as to where to start do you know dad's age you can estimate that grandpa was probably between age when dad was born standard suggestion to new researchers is always talk to family we have to remember that not all of us have that option for starting with due to real life situations like yours obviously if mom has hostility towards dad's relatives that is not something to raise up without careful thought and tact here in the us finding records opens up when it is assumed or known that the person is no longer alive i'll share a personal thought with you while i urge you to act with caution depending on your personal details is it possible that the grandparents are still alive i have grandchildren who are being sucked away due to a family conflict and don't see i hope that there comes a day when they are adults that they choose to find me of their own choice it is a deep hole and pain for me you are welcome to send me a private note through my profile if you like  Family Genealogy Divorce Fathers' rights Adoption Friends Who is a Jew?

how do we find out what happened to my nans other children we have recentley found a document saying that my nan my moms mom had children all together we only know of she says he had still births but how do we find out obviously we have no names or dates would there be a record of all her children somewhere can anyone help i believe that still births are still registered in the normal way because you have to have a funeral even if this is carried out by the hospital and an undertaker can't bury a body without a death certificate being produced births marriages and deaths are always registered in the area where the event happened so you could have a look at the registrations in your nan's home registration district look at the dates you have the for other children and anywhere there is a suspiciously long gap the probability is that right in the middle of one of those will be a still birth if it was local to me i would just pop in the register office and have a chat with the superintendent registrar she is very helpful and will let me do a short search for free don't go on a monday which is their busy day  Census Indian nationality law Genealogy Trademark British nationality law Domain Name System History of British nationality law Charmed 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression EastEnders General Register Office for Scotland Whois Civil unions in the United Kingdom 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Warren G.

could the wertenberg on old census records actually be w rttemberg germany i was just wondering because during my genealogical research i came across a census record from the th century that listed my great great great grandmother's birthplace as being wertenberg i looked for places in germany with that name and the closest place names i came to were wartenberg which is in berlin and w rttemberg which was an independent state before the german empire was formed in i'm assuming that my great great great grandmother came to the states before so what do you think it is likely w rttemberg as this is was a large community with many folks emigrating remember census folks back then didn't always know how to spell very well and they often had trouble understanding the accent of our german ancestors  Census Former countries in Europe after 1815 Karlsruhe Stuttgart Genealogy Prussia W__rttemberg Baden States of Germany Franco-Prussian War Elections in Germany German language The Revolutions of 1848 in the German states Schw__bisch Hall Prince-elector Adolf Hitler First French Empire Rhineland-Palatinate Compendium of postage stamp issuers (Ga - Ge) Pennsylvania German language Strasbourg Brandenburg English language Victoria of the United Kingdom Germany Umlaut Ludwig van Beethoven Greek language Left Party (Germany) Marlene Dietrich Baden-W__rttemberg History of Finland Russian language Line of succession to the British Throne Bavaria Music of Germany Mary of Teck Latin alphabet Folk music Franz Boas German reunification History of the Jews in Germany Danish language German as a minority language History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union Confederation of the Rhine Wilhelm I of Germany Friedrich List Gau (German) Jesse Owens Numerus clausus Swabian Alb Wilhelm II of Germany Transport in Germany Non-native pronunciations of English Berlin S-Bahn Joschka Fischer Federation of Expellees Political subdivisions of New York State Hanover Anschluss Austria-Hungary Swabia German Mediatisation Constantine I (emperor) Magyars The Pied Piper of Hamelin Theodor Heuss Reichstag (institution) Hesse Albert Einstein Tamriel Occitan language Humboldt University of Berlin Austro-Prussian War New Zealand English History of Africa English-speaking Europe Cradle of Humanity Erwin Rommel Status of religious freedom in Germany Max Planck George V of the United Kingdom Weingarten (W__rttemberg) Klaus Fuchs Pietism Biberach an der Ri__ Ferrari Civilization III Nicholas I of Russia Theodor Adorno Expulsion of Germans after World War II Salzburg History of the English language Gda__sk Metz City-state History of Vilnius Volksdeutsche Evolutionism

how do i find a birth record if the person was born before they started keeping record the place in de kalb indiana says they did not start keeping records of births until the person i'm looking for was born any suggestions about how to obtain this there is a fine distinction between a birth certificate and a birth record and no it isn't at all unusual for there to be nothing at city hall the majority of states did not require anything before it all depends on the specific state is pretty good anything that contains the information is a record for her it could be the death certificate it may be the census that can be iffy since it has many errors it can be a bible record it can be the tombstone baptism records are good obituaries may also be available what you are looking for is an explicit birth record when actually the fact or info will come from other sources try to find several sources and be prepared for contradictions that is standard operating procedure in research that's when you decide which source is most likely to be correct but your note will also include a statement ie tombstone shows but she was shown as nine yrs old in census one bite at a time and it will start pulling together as you go  Baptism Genealogy Census Pretty Good Privacy Halting problem C programming language Legal aspects of transsexualism Scientology beliefs and practices Expert system Abortion Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Complexity classes P and NP Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Identity theft Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Software testing Information Technology Infrastructure Library G__del's incompleteness theorem Wyatt Earp Debugging Scientific method Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Binary numeral system Family history Pi Chronology of Jesus Purple Heart Alcoholics Anonymous Intelligent design Indian nationality law History of British nationality law Sarbanes-Oxley Act Copyright law of the United Kingdom Biblical inerrancy Probation officer Starfleet ranks and insignia Appeal MDAC Contract ISO 9000 Same-sex marriage in the United States Royal Assent C plus plus Geographic references New Testament Paralegal 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines ITU-T SCO-Linux controversies Book of Mormon Nontrinitarianism Bush v.

is there a online location to see a death cert for free death certificates are relatively recent in the us most states didn't require so much as a register of deaths no individual certificates until the very late th century the individual certificate wasn't common until the s when people started frequenting hospitals most death certificates aren't available online because of privacy issues with the exceptions noted above but most counties will allow you to view the certificate for free if you go to the county clerk's office the other option is to contact the county and request a non certified copy aka genealogy copy which usually only costs a dollar or two if the death is relatively recent the other way to view the certificate for free is to contact the funeral home and ask them for a copy  Notary public Census Legal aspects of transsexualism Pretty Good Privacy Organic certification Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Identity theft Public domain High school Public-key cryptography Certification Same-sex marriage in the United States Genealogy Software engineering Whitney Houston Accountancy Information Technology Infrastructure Library 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Paralegal Silver Certificate Bush v.

anyone dealt with becoming a member of the cherokee nation i've been at it for over a year now at first they appeared to be extremely helpful my natural father's grandmother appeared on the dawes rolls i got them all of my ancestry background and thought everything was okay then we got to some issues my parents were divorced and i was adopted by my stepfather at and he changed my name my parents and stepfather have all passed away my father's sister is alive and could give me a certified letter about my parentage i actually have a certified copy of my original birth certificate showing my natural father also have my birth certificate showing my stepfather as my father i live in illinois where all records of adoptions are considered closed ie impossible to get a record of any of this i can't believe the cherokee nation hasn't dealt with this type of thing before anyone able to give me any insight can you appeal their decisions or lack of a decision to anyone i feel your pain i can't prove my great grandmother's birth and my great grandfather refused to let her register so the cherokee nation won't recognize me at all if you have submitted all of your documentation with a clear explanation then it is up to the tribal council to make a decision don't look for a good one they really don't like to let outsiders in they are very very picky you can petition the court to have your adoption open and if you tell the judge why he may then you can get what you need if not then you might try ordering a copy of the transcript of the hearing you may or may not get it you will have to pay for it if they do release it to you you already have the main documents that you need both birth certificates so i don't know what else you want from the court it takes them a long time to give you an answer as they get hundreds of applications they have to go thru all those documents and check them out and make the decision so be patient if you don't hear anything within months then contact them do you have a local tribal office where you are if you do take your documentation to them and ask for their assistance they may help you out good luck  Appeal Cherokee Same-sex marriage in the United States Judicial functions of the House of Lords Divorce Notary public SCO-Linux controversies Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Legal aspects of transsexualism Transsexuality Terri Schiavo Abortion debate British nationality law Contract Legal research Moss v.

charlemagne decedents anyone here have resources that could help me trace a family name back to charlemange i have been unable to trace it directly from charlemange so i was wondering if i could work backwards it's extremely expensive to do the primary research your own snooping through records that no one else ever documented and prove your lineage to charlemagne the last project i'm aware of that did so was the catherine de baillon research project about years ago three extremely well respected researchers spent several thousand dollars and several hundred hours of research to get the documents needed from the various departements of france to prove the lineage of catherine de baillon back to charlemagne it was very tedious and took them several years to locate the records then months for the boxes to arrive and more months for them to read through everything organize it and prove that one of their three working theses was correct now if you descend from catherine de baillon and jacques miville dit desch nes you can use the dulong research to tie into charlemagne's lineage http habitant org baillon index htm if you believe you descend from another major or minor european royal you can check through the published research to see if any ties you into charlemagne there aren't many research projects outside of the nobles and royals that will tie a commoner into the merovingians  Genealogy Franks Computer Chinese surname France in the Middle Ages Hundred Years' War Jacques Cartier Nobility Common Unix Printing System Graduate school Catherine of Aragon History of the Internet Commune in France Early Modern France Wget Bioinformatics Medieval French literature Kingdom of Navarre History of Germany Thesis Extreme Programming Domesday Book HyperText Transfer Protocol Open access MMORPG Daylight saving time Henry VII of England Legal research The Da Vinci Code XML Jean-Jacques Rousseau Mach kernel Montreal Tetrapod Democracy Count Fournier Sleeping Murder Counts of Toulouse CPU cache Catherine II of Russia Jewish history European Union Enterprise content management Refugee Scientology beliefs and practices Nation of Islam Armenian Genocide Chronology of the Ancient Near East Emperor of Japan Wikipedia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Evolution Floppy disk Black (people) Michel Foucault Voltaire Social Security (United States) Tennessee State Constitution Funeral E-mail spam John F.

does anyone know of a free website to locate a family member in idaho i only have a last name i take this as a live person and the lds files don't do live persons they do ancestors there are online directories such as yahoo people search zabasearch peoplefinder com all of which are geared to live people you can search for any smith in idaho is your person's last name unique enough that you will know it if it comes up you might also try using google for the surname and state tends to be better if you have a full name and put the name in quotation marks by the way nothing wrong with asking about live people on this board but it is not ethical or wise for me to post direct identifying information a fine line we tread here  Genealogy Search engine optimization Google search W.

you go in through ya canada ya australia ya uk or ya usa all of the questions go into one big pot and get read by everyone in the world who speaks english most of the people here are in the uk and usa but you sometimes get questions and answers from people who worry about kangaroos eating their roses so if you are asking about a specific individual put a nation and a state province it will help people help you here is another if you are now and the result of a long line of teen aged lovers you were born years ago in your father was born years before that in your grandfather was born years

how can i figure out my great grandfather's name my grandmother never knew who her dad was her mother had her out of wedlock which was very frowned upon back then i know that my grandmother's mom grew up in r county and i know that my grandmother also grew up in that same county however less than a month before my grandmother was born a census was done and shows that my grandmother's mom was living in p county with her sister and brother in law sometimes my grandmother would say she was born in r county and at other times she said it was p county i would assume that based on the fact that her mother was in p county less than a month before she was born that she was born there and then went to be raised in r county immediately afterwards i would guess that her mother just went there to sort of hide out while being pregnant i know that the father was a farm boy but everyone was a farmer then my aunt thinks his name may have been b but it is a very common name and she's not sure it was very common to ship an unwed mother off to a relative back then to try and save face where the family lived if your grandmother was living with her sister your mother probably was born in p county but if you know for a fact your grandmother was born in r county i'd make it a point to go there and hit the books at the court house plan on staying in that area for a few days so you can scrutinize death birth and will books along with land record books you can get copies of the pages of the books you need so be sure and take extra cash with you to cover the cost you might want to call them ahead of time and see what they charge so you are prepared you might want to try this at home first but if you have a digital camera try taking copies of books in a darker room to see how well they come out if it works ok take the camera with you and take pictures of the pages you need and save yourself the cost of copies unless you want the copies for your files be sure and record the letter number of the book and what page the information is on even record information you think might connect because you may connect some of it later i have done that before in va back when i had to hand write everything and still have the books in a box in the garage i was able to connect some of that information later when i got books with census records so was thankful i had gone ahead and recorded it even though i wasn't sure if they were kin or not also while you are there try to find family members who still live in that area and talk with them record your conversations for future reference and be sure and ask if that is ok with them first let them know you want to transcribe all the stories you gather for your records i have quite a few cassette tapes of my grandmother's cousins who shared stories and it was so neat to see the personality of each person and understand them a little better and what they went through take your digital camera wish we had had those when i started and take pictures of pictures they have so you will be able to put faces with names you might also try to get information at http www rootsweb com and see if you can gather as much information as possible before heading there remember this is just info others have recorded and may not always be accurate but it may still give you some leads and or connections enter the name you are looking for in the rootsweb area have to pay at ancestor then when you get to the next page click on worldconnect and see if anyone has entered your family information i have some lines i've not been able to connect either so i know how frustrating it can be but hope yours will be easier to locate just to give you some satisfaction and peace of mind have fun have lots of patience and don't give up too easily good
