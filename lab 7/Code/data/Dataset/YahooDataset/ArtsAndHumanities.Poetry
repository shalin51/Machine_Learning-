and one more rewrite i really appreciate your help on these innocence longing for the time i knew when my life belonged to me i was just a child you see innocent unique and free in the mist of night i dream the terror still rips at me i can feel like yesterday the man that i most despise he a wolf in sheeps disguise stole my innocence from me used me for his own dark sin ripped assunder by this man he stole the thing most precious my innocence and my hopes i hope the bastard burns away in hell where his type belong i pay the price everyday him forever and a day a couple points to consider on your rewrite steve l unique doesn't say a lot consider a word that conveys something l might want to include it after feel l wolf in sheep's disguise remember the apostrophe you may want to change this anyway it's a bit predictable for you i like your last line however i'm begging for more concrete details in here it's an emotional topic and i feel like though difficult psychologically you need to go deeper here what i mean is when i get to l rather than knowing that you the narrator are innocent and so on i'd rather focus on something that depicts that innocence some scene or image and then later when you crush the image there is an emotional response in the reader same with l the terror i'd like to see you take it a bit deeper i know you can it's just by drawing these images more fully through the poem i think you'd gain an emotional punch which is probably why you are rewriting this one so much it isn't quite giving you the payoff that you know the scene can give just my thoughts use what works disregard the rest  Jon Secada Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin City EastEnders The Amber Spyglass Blade Runner Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Invisibles Hell Time Out of Mind Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Days of our Lives Scenes from a Memory Eisner Award Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Sigmund Freud Social rule Meaning of life The Second Renaissance Characters in the Smurfs The Brothers Karamazov Theory of conduct Book of Mormon Venom (comics) Narrator The Hobbit Transformers: Cybertron John Berryman Russian joke Pitaten Nineteen Eighty-Four Storytelling Procrastination American Psycho Microeconomics Blood on the Tracks Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Gene Wolfe One Piece minor characters Daredevil The Star Wars Holiday Special Paradise Lost Humphrey Bogart Internet troll Obi-Wan Kenobi Consciousness Bon Jovi Zoophilia Poker jargon Marie Antoinette Anne Boleyn Video game controversy Alfred Hitchcock Altruism Art Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) 2005 Bali bombings Phoebe Halliwell Characters of Naruto Trainspotting (novel) About Schmidt Discordianism Blood (computer game) Infantilism Lewis Carroll Vulcan (Star Trek) Empathy Knots Landing Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Wassily Kandinsky Spidey Super Stories Objectivist philosophy The Pilgrim's Progress S__ren Kierkegaard Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Innocence: Ghost in the Shell Screenwriting Gospel of Thomas Soul W.I.T.C.H.

is 'if' by rudyard kipling the greatest poem ever written the last lines are priceless if you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue or walk with king nor lose the common touch if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you if all men count with you but none too much if you can fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds' worth of distance run yours is the earth and everything that's in it and which is more you'll be a man my son 'greatest' is too superlative to be applied to any art really all titles given like epic or masterpiece are open to interpretation the only thing one can know for sure is if they believe it to be the best they've read that said 'if' is a wonderful description of what a person should strive to be and what a true man should hold dear honor dignity and virtue these ever elusive traits were just as rare in kipling's time as they are today but nevertheless cherished perhaps kipling's most well known work this poem is one of the most inspirational that i have ever read and still remains one of my personal favorites for the message it carries if nothing else after all i've always maintained that poetry is nothing if its only words on paper true poetry has the ability to carry both emotion and ideas to its readers  Rudyard Kipling If___ Poetry Paradise Lost Jorge Luis Borges Tommy Atkins Catullus British literature Victorian literature Socrates Literature Lu__s de Cam__es Japanese poetry Simone Weil Imagism Novel Philo William Butler Yeats Ethics Aristotle The Faerie Queene Gary Snyder Eli Siegel The Brothers Karamazov Lyric poetry Johann Wolfgang von Goethe T.

another poem i wrote how good or bad honest answers only please days go by so quickly nights go by so slow laying awake in my bed i wonder why you had to go you never looked back the day you left me like that you said you d never forget our ride to the moon way up high above the heads of our friends we were the only ones there way up on the moon your eyes were diamonds so sapphire blue your smile sent me somewhere i think it was the moon so far away that was so long ago too i wonder if it has changed as i stare up at that moon okay it has promise you echo the word moon on all your last lines except the first stanza and it's conspicuous by its absence fix that put it in the last line on the first stanza is weak anyway so this might make it right check your beats you've decided to do unrhymed verse that's fine but you need to keep the cadence moving and you don't you drop beats here and there and they wouldn't be difficult to fix so fix them have someone read the lines out loud to you so you can hear them in someone else's voice i can tell by the tone that you'll be able to hear the problem areas and i have every confidence you'll be able to fix them on your own be careful on under overstatements way up high is obviously above the heads of our friends so you need a different example especially if you're going to refer to the moon again also i sense your version of long ago is probably only a few years so be careful of sounding pretentious you can say that it seems so long ago that would be fine i hope you see the difference otherwise it had an even tone and like i said possibilities work on it a bit and post a revision if you think it's been improved meanwhile keep writing  Social rule Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story Meter (poetry) John Berryman Milton H.

what's it like to be a bird or an animal i'm not thinking what's it like to fly or any of that sort of thing i'm wondering how can you describe the just being side of the life of animals and birds is their experience of the world just like ours is just being alive a universal shared experience when i just stare up at the clouds and empty my mind am i experiencing what a bird or animal feels when it is similarly idle many people i know seem to feel that animals and birds are just automatons that just go through the set routine of their lives without any of the joy wonder or awareness that humans experience i have my doubts about this and actually suspect that a bird has a much more immediate and vivid life experience as they have presumably less distractions than the relatively sophisticated human psyche so i have no idea how one could try to envisage life as experienced by a bird or an animal and i suspect their is no mechanistic way of doing so that's why i'm here in the poetry section looking for ideas i've come to pay the pinder the other day a girl asked how terrible it must be for the fly that is stuck to flypaper and i remarked to another two dogs in the wild will fight to the death without considering the other how much horror do the beasts experience what is the capacity of each i've seen wild dogs in the jungle attacking each other i once watched the ants ravage a caterpillar the amazement is as you observe the nature of the beast you see that fear is the most primal emotion hunger and lust show themselves only when aroused the horror of being eaten alive is constant in the animal world so to be the cat you must first fear the dog then you may prowl the night for fish heads and females  Garfield Charles Darwin Milton H.

do you agree with what coleridge said read details no man was ever yet a great poet without being at the same time a profound philosopher i agree of course because great poetry is born out of philospohy by great poetry i mean poetry that really gets you thinking colerigde was himself a philosopher if you study such poems like kubla kahn or the rime of the ancient mariner you'll notice that all peoms hide great philosophical questions even an apparently simple nature poem i believe must have a philosophical idea behind it that started the meditation about nature or vice versa being in nature observing its beauty may start meditation on some philosophical idea like the poetry of robert frost  Samuel Taylor Coleridge Philosophy William Shakespeare English literature Taoism Lyric poetry Poetry Yehuda Halevi Fernando Pessoa Sri Aurobindo Four Quartets The Rime of the Ancient Mariner Gary Snyder Poetry of the United States Japanese poetry Sanskrit literature Ancient Greek literature Aristotle History of literature William Wordsworth Robert Frost T.

how do you understand literature is a language this is how i understand it every time you read a literary text be it poetry a novel or a play or anything it is as if you were entering another world and had to adopt or accept a new type of language you have to forget about your own way of expressing yourself and have a humble attitude towards that text in the same way as when you learn a foreign language sometimes there are things you don't understand but later you will if you are lucky i often compare literature to lewis carroll's through the looking glass you leave your own world and values and accept fiction accept the willing suspension of disbelief just a few thoughts interesting question td euwaite thanks  Literature Chinese language Suspension of disbelief Novel Philosophy of language English language Martin Heidegger Translation Imagism Anglo-Saxon literature British literature A Course In Miracles Japanese literature Atheism Arabic language Victorian literature C.

how does this poem make you feel hopeless useless like a million bucks decembers death a winter so white and pail snow falling like heavens hail the disease within it grows the more you wallow in your sorrow blood strewn all around you on the white ground even in your own bloodshed your sanity cannot be found your arms all ugly and torn open like a newly raped little orphan but i'm seeing myself through decembers eyes watching myself in cold pain and agonize as i come upon myself i spit on me for being so pathetic and too weak to break free break free from my misery and pain but as i'm watching i became engulfed in it again i couldn't comletely forget i had to loose myself in little forgotten deaths the disease within is deep loneliness i wish i could escape this cold abyss the disease has destroied my insides now i am no longer alive well i'm only so i don't think that i can qualify as a sick the million bucks was a joke i almost put lol in the question but people wouldn't know what was so funny you know once i had a dream and long story short the grim reaper stabbed me with a knife i wrote a poem when i woke up and it became something beautiful not tragic basically what i'm saying is that poetry is a flow of words with an idea inside not necessarily always a mirror image of someones soul beauty is in the eye of the beholder so we can't judge you or your poetry so simply just keep writing and if people decide to judge you on words alone thats their prerogative and their loss you write passionately and that is always enough  The Amber Spyglass Jon Secada Shaggy dog story Scenes from a Memory John Berryman Dean Koontz EastEnders Fitz Hugh Ludlow Miss Saigon YuYu Hakusho Dead Like Me The Shining (film) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Death Gate Cycle Characters of The Sandman Hell Demon Simone Weil Time Out of Mind Death (personification) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prostate cancer Friends Death Piccolo Junior Saga Vegeta Night (book) Races in the Warcraft universe William Shakespeare Series finale Joke Phaedo The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Tenshinhan Characters of Naruto Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Lovely Bones The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Angel Sanctuary Characters in the Smurfs King James Version of the Bible Anne Rice Meaning of life Soul Novel Drizzt Do'Urden Equine conformation D.

does this poem have good use of imagery it's not really a poem just something random that i might use later it's called first date can you envision what your reading is it descriptive enough with that first kiss he sealed the deal unknowingly right then and there with his crimson lips carressing mine that was the moment he captured my heart and don't get me wrong it wasn't all about the kiss the moments leading up to it were just as special him taking my hand as we strolled on the sidewalk after a sensational dinner infatuated with each other and enraptured with the easy flowing conversation the world around us disappeared we exchanged smiles way too many times to count and laughed at each others jokes consistently whenever i spoke i couldn't help but notice how he stared at me with adoring eyes i stopped in mid sentence to smile as i blushed then continued with the story and whenever he spoke i did the same giving him every ounce of my attention thinking to myself could he be any more perfect for the record i know this is not a poem it's more like a start to a short story or novel it's a good start but i have a few suggestions to make it into a poem you just have to cut a couple phrases and it will flow really nice like right then and there also break up the lines in to stanzas keep up the writing i really love the line crimson lips carressing mine lovely imagery  Shaggy dog story Whose Line Is It Anyway?

another poem i wrote a new girl in class she s eight years old she s always quiet and does what she s told atop her head is a little girl s hat she hides her hair just like that during lunch the girl sits alone nobody s there she s on her own she lifts off her hat and shows her head the teacher s heart fills with dread little molly is shining bright she knows she s going to win this fight her hair is gone it all fell out little molly has no doubt she smiles each day it may be her last don t treat her so fragile she isn t glass deep inside she knows the truth she prob ly won t live past her youth little molly s tears fall down her face she shows the world her rolling grace dancing her dance each day awake she tries to make not one mistake little molly s mom called in today this is all she had to say my little molly will be gone she asks you to play her favorite song she s sick right now and won t return she hopes her friends will stop and learn continued below little molly s sick with cancer no doctors know the answer today will be her last day here she asks you to not shed a tear little molly is shining bright she knows she s going to win this fight her hair is gone it all fell out little molly has no doubt she smiles each day it may be her last don t treat her so fragile she isn t glass deep inside she knows the truth she prob ly won t live past her youth little molly s tears fall down her face she shows the world her rolling grace dancing her dance each day awake she tries to make not one mistake little molly died that very night she gave her mom a rose of white she smiled her smile and laughed once more then little molly learned to soar very emotional poem made me very sad and at the same time made me realize how special each moment is and isn't that what we as poets want for our poems to reach out and grab someone's attention whether love or heart ache or even something as what you just spoke of i felt as though this poem did exactly that and i applaude you so in other words very very excellent poem  Jon Secada The Amber Spyglass Pok__mon Live!

what do you think how can you hurt someone who meant the world to you hurt the one that would die for you how can you break her heart to go find someone new and leave her crying hoping she was still the one for you how can you take someone else to your dance not even give her a second chance how can you watch her standing there with tears in her eyes while you dance with that girl to the song that held so many lies how can you live with yourself after what you ve done you promised her she was the only one but then you went and broke her heart and left the pieces on the floor left her life and locked the door now the only man that holds the key will be able to set her heart free my boyfriend of a year broke up with me and asked my best friend to our homecoming dance he and i kept in touch and promised that we would dance together if they played far away which had been our old song when the song came on he looked up at me and said not today and went back to dancing and singing the song to my best friend while i stood there feet away watching them in tears i thought if you knew what the poem was about it would be easier to place yourself in my shoes this poem is strat from the heart and is exactly how i felt that night that's a very nice poem i could almost picture the person while reading it  Jon Secada Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) One Tree Hill (TV series) Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Pitaten Fiddler on the Roof Tears for Fears Blood on the Tracks Theory of conduct Hall & Oates Miss Saigon Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Pip (South Park episode) The Jazz Singer Fancy Crane Shawn Michaels EastEnders The Amber Spyglass Bon Jovi Time Out of Mind The Doctor Dances The Ashlee Simpson Show Sin City Nico Robin The Beatles discography Boom Town (Doctor Who) The Emancipation of Mimi The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Highway 61 Revisited Harry Nilsson Kodocha Sex and the City Knots Landing Phoebe Buffay's songs Social rule Johnny Appleseed The Inside Unreleased Madonna songs Avenue Q Eddie Guerrero The Catcher in the Rye Bonnie Tyler Friends The Contender (television series) Muslim ibn Aqeel Professional wrestling match types Yehuda Halevi Ray Charles Phil Collins Remix Marching band Professional wrestling holds Socrate Scenes from a Memory Johnny Cash Ocean's Twelve Rent (musical) We Belong Together 50 First Dates Cyndi Lauper Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME About a Boy Titanic (1997 film) Billie Frank A-ha The Parting of the Ways Tori Amos Alfred Edward Housman The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Irish dance DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Kill Bill Roxette StarCraft: Uprising Paul Is Dead Past teachings of Prem Rawat Pok__mon Live!

poem not yet mine please critique i laid here beside you one night in the dark longing to hear your heartbeat and feel your touch knowing that your heart wasn't yet mine i gently placed my arm around you that night and lightly pressed my body to yours just to feel the warmth of your body against mine a promise i had made this promise that for you i kept to not take what i wanted as mine when my hand touched yours you tucked it under your own and that night my heart was no longer mine rick kinda on the right track but it's more that he wasn't ready for the committment and she was and her heart is already deeply involved here's my one question for you does this poem work on multiple levels or does it just relate an event it's not enough to tell us about something you need to have some revelation about the event i would challenge you to rethink this and attempt to take it to the next level that would be the sum total of my critique i hope it helps in some way take care  Milton H.

is this poem good be honest every time you come around my cheeks turn cherry red i don t know what to say and i have no clue what you just said my stomach fills with butterflies as i stare deep into your deep blue eyes i start to shiver and my hands they shake when i think about you as i lay awake you make me feel warm and whole if only you understood the heart you just stole wow i don't believe i'm doing this but i'm actually going to disagree with todd sorry todd it was bound to happen sooner or later your poem isn't all that bad are the lines a bit cliche yes but i don't think that it matters all that much considering you're writing it to someone and that's pretty much what people do who are young and only have what they've heard to draw upon so that being said you can clean up your poem a little by doing a few simple things you need to drop some beats from the first two lines try this when you come around my cheeks turn cherry red i don't know what to say i don't know what you just said it only drops a few words but i think it keeps the meaning and tightens it up a little think about changing the line i start to shiver so you drop the they make it i start to shiver and my hands start to shake it's what you want to say so just say it the next line drop the when so the line reads i think about you as i lay awake only make it lie awake you can't really lay awake add a three to even the beats and invert the two lines so that the whole thing reads i think about you as i lie there awake i start to shiver and my hands start to shake then the last two lines you make me feel warm and whole it has too few beats and warm is a little soft but we'll keep it for now moving a few words around adding a few to even out the beats try this you make me feel warm safe happy and whole if you only understood the heart that you stole put them all together and see what you think i think your poem shows promise next time you can write about something a little less personally directed something we can all connect with a little more keep writing  Theory of conduct Milton H.

hi i need opinons on my poem these thoughts keep reoccurring in the depths of my mind and every coincidence is an excuse for a sign the way that every heart beat is right on cue and the things i never had to tell you because you already knew the clearest of blurs that i have ever seen in the perceivers eye is yet but a dream the intimacy in our senses while we secretly switch glances tell me there is a reason you are worth taking these chances the way that you make me feel so fey like i can confide in you through out a single bleak day like the sun could deteriorate but you could hold out its rays it could all merely be a wrong perception a map i was given with no direction a path only created for a physical reason like a leaf that will disappear come the winter season for lust or for touch or for some other meaningless cause along with all this doubt that if i stay around will you notice my flaws still i long to sit upon your knees as if they were a kings thrown to have you blanket your arms around me and keep me sheltered and warm in between my company of trash and saints you are the calm of the water that is keeping me sane intentions unknown no sticks without stones just me these false hopes high with that fear of disappointment and being left out to dry too long  Time Out of Mind Jon Secada K' Causality Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Daredevil Philosophical skepticism Poker jargon Yoga Sutras of Patanjali God Emperor of Dune Social rule Weather lore Textile manufacturing 2000 Australian Grand Prix Epistemology Deconstruction God and gender The Church Autism Love War of the Worlds (television) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Dualism (philosophy of mind) Direct realism Religion Snooker Lucid dreaming Homunculi of Fullmetal Alchemist Infantilism Treehouse of Horror V Glossary of partner dance terms Alexander Technique Scientific method Pitaten Falsifiability Alaga__sia Negima G-Man (Half-Life) Denis Law The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Ten Commandments Satchel Paige Philosophy of perception Kain (Legacy of Kain) Atheism Episodes of Lost (Season 2) The nature of God in Western theology Metaphysics Maurice Merleau-Ponty Peter Shilton Physical intimacy Enneagram David Bowie Swingout Diving Arguments for and against drug prohibition Sigmund Freud Sabbath Francisco Hern__ndez de C__rdoba (discoverer of Yucat__n) Neuro-linguistic programming Theodicy The Dunciad Tlingit Appeasement Narrator Naruto jutsu Psychoanalysis Philosophy of mathematics William II of England Japanese tea ceremony Duties of the Heart Ra (board game) Vipassana Blood on the Tracks Professional wrestling throws Existence of God 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Aerial (dance move) 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Domestic violence One Piece minor characters Tag Aikido Milton H.

what do you think of my poem bring your scarf maroon soaked coat let s run away someplace remote take my hand embrace my arm as i m near you i m hotter than warm the deserted park just you and i on this rainy day of july let s gaze into each others eyes and chase around the fireflies make paper boats to drop on streams have vanilla caramel sweet ice creams talk of the world of what we believe happy go lucky carelessly naive cuddle and flirt by the colored see saw blinded by love by lack of flaw dancing to melodious whispers of wind as we waltzed along giggled and grinned splashing in puddles as though we were five enjoying the treasures of being alive forget all your troubles erase all the pain timeless romance as we kiss in the rain time to depart as skies turn gray we say goodbye in our own little way tomorrow again he yells far away being with him was the best of today hi i'm valeria i'm fifteen years old i've already posted this poem but i just wanted to hear more opinions about it i don't have a title for it yet suggestions are gladly welcome much love d i think you have done well the rhyming isn't at all bad but the rhythm gets a little off and the timing gets a little off in a couple places but not bad i'm sure that will improve you switched from present tense to past tense and back again which threw it off a bit also but still not bad enough to worry about keep writing it gets better with time and i see talent underlying what you did my best advise to you is to develope your style of poetry and don't let others dictate how you write do it the way you like and it will flow like water and appeal to many my choice for your title would be something on the order of love in the park  Happy Tree Friends Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Time Out of Mind Cliff Richard AFI 100 Years series Sin City Billboard Hot 100 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Milton H.

this is the last time i will post this todd kind king of the pile of answers are you still around i'm sure it still needs work but i think i'm getting closer any advice on stanza breaks how like voices the rain sounds tonight like the hard whisper of prophets the truth of the finite in each breaking drop how sobering to feel yourself at the center of this blossoming death how strange to be within that which grows within you and the scent is not sweet the whole reach of death the slipping of skin the cracking of bones the accumulation of creases between the burden of knowledge and the terror of mystery we in darkness lie what words are there for a mother who must release her child she sits even now empty open arms longing to embrace that which left them empty to hold it gently there was a bird fallen and you held its shivering flesh in your child hand too young to know what name to give this sadness but alive enough to feel the change when the small body stiffened you knew you had touched something more permanent than life you learned of burial and gravestones that day your empty hand a child s no more and something was left behind as you moved from this moment a passing your passing into this knowledge my last revision though a good exercise didn't feel right or authentic i think i salvaged some of my original ideas from the clumsy words they were trapped in i also included more than the savagely cut last version todd my most recent edits were almost exclusively due to your time and tolerance spent on my work thank you ever so much your critique was excellent you may plant a kiss on your computer screen hassan i'm sure it will reach me some how also you needn't be todd to comment on the poem i'm glad you found it interesting enough to read i can see someone's been editing and doing a good job at it the first stanza is very very well done i'd look at breaking though maybe fragile do drops break you might be able to find a better word but the stanza flows very well nicely done line breaks in the nd stanza need work try this how sobering to feel at the center of this blossoming death how strange to be within that which grows within you and the scent is not sweet this mirrors more closely the pattern of the first stanza and by dropping yourself which is unnecessary here you bring the beats back in line stanza three has similar problems maybe this might work the whole reach of death slipping of skin cracking of bones accumulation of creases between burden of knowledge and terror of mystery we in darkness lie again it better mirrors the previous stanzas although the th line takes the place of the rd line in beats dropping of the the s helped remove the repetative sounds and more focus on the beautiful counterpoint you thought up without distraction finally the last stanza try this what words are there for a mother who must release her child she sits even now empty open arms longing to embrace that which left them empty the poem is beautiful really it is my editing recommendations are just that recommendations but i believe they keep your poem true to itself and resolve some of the line break issues you'd been wrestling with or at least i hope they've pointed you in the right direction again beautifully done keep writing  The Amber Spyglass Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Whose Line Is It Anyway?

is this more likely to be a poem or a rhymed thought honestly like the star when it glitters in a velvet night like the sun when it dawns to make a day bright like the moon s beam that comforts a heart in the dark like the lighthouse that shores at night light and mark and like what no words can ever describe to me he is and if my growing love i did hide i was scared i won t be his does he know that all my thoughts are centred upon him does he know that he s the only one my life did rebegin alas for me feelings towards him he tends to ignore a sweet sister a friendly friend or a love he s still not sure but if he once opened his eyes he ll see just me whose feelings for him did rise and before him never felt that happy whether he ll stay or not he still needs some time to think but if he asked me i ll say i ll be always there before his eyes blink i ve lost the key of the carved closed box in my chest and my restless tired and roaming soul now deserves a rest if he chose to be away then my blocked box he s to break if he chose to be away i ll do before him but for whose sake with tears streaming on my heart i ll tell him you re free to go i ll utter it not because i m weak for my weakness did my strength show heartily i ll be happy for him whatever his sentence will be for alas he is a dream that will not turn to be a reality i think it has potential but you should read it over and do some revising i mean this as constructive criticism maybe you should avoid all that twisting of phrases such as that shores at night light and mark this rearrangement doesnt make it seem any more poetic im not saying get rid of all the pharses that are written this way but maybe a few but you have a lot of talent you should be so proud of your work  Jon Secada Sin City Care Bears Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Amber Spyglass John Berryman Rent (musical) One Tree Hill (TV series) Shen Gong Wu Poetry Blink-182 The Beatles discography W.I.T.C.H.

a revision death title hmmm i still need help i like this version better as a poem i think i took everybody's advice from last time for everyone offered something valuable and so specific to the poem but i've been staring at it for so long i just don't know how it reads speaks looks even if you have a second help me out you have all been crucial to this creative process by the way i can not fully express my gratitude how like voices the rain sounds tonight like the hard whisper of prophets the truth of the finite in each breaking drop how sobering to feel yourself at the center of this blossoming death how strange to be within that which grows within you and the scent is not sweet the whole reach of death the slipping of skin the cracking of bones the accumulation of creases between the burden of knowledge and things barely named we in darkness lie what words are there for the mother open arms broken circle can we embrace that which leaves them empty to hold it gently there was a bird fallen and you held it s shivering flesh in your child hand incomprehensible this but you were alive enough to feel the change when the small body stiffened you knew you had touched permanence a passing your passing into this knowledge thank you td that means a lot luckie your word were very kind and encouraging thank you for taking the time to look at my poem todd well i don't know what to say except thank you so much willow i think you are so talented you are one of the writers i look forward to reading every time you post i really do want to see this poem develop to its fullest i think you have something really nice here and it isn t there yet but it s getting closer i m spent some time looking at both revisions how like voices the rain sounds tonight like the hard whisper of prophets the truth of the finite in each breaking drop i think the shorter line lengths work better there is more tension in this this is still one of the most beautiful images in the poem the fragile quality of an exploding raindrop reflecting the impermanence of life i think it leads into your theme very well how sobering to feel yourself at the center of this blossoming death how strange to be within that which grows within you and the scent is not sweet the shorter lines here give you a sense of wondering and discovery as opposed to being statements i think that works better for your purpose i like the removal of the rose image and the word nostrils both were unnecessary for your point you still get across the flower image simply through blossoming good word economy the whole reach of death the slipping of skin the cracking of bones the accumulation of creases between the burden of knowledge and things barely named we in darkness lie the lead in from the scent is not sweet works as a transition there is a part of me that wants to move right to the child with the bird here but i m divided as this still works and that change might screw up your conclusion too much i do like that you changed the order skin bones creases creases creates a nice little resonance with the word between which i love as a single line acting as a bridge between the act of death and the knowledge it brings the line and things barely named i know what you are getting at here i think this needs to be rephrased whether it s a fear of naming or a stigma with naming there is a nuance that needs to be added here that captures the raw dread that accompanies this knowledge that explores this burden so to speak i love the dual meaning of the word lie and i like it on its own line what words are there for the mother open arms broken circle can we embrace that which leaves them empty i know the idea you are trying to get across here in the original version in this current revision it isn t coming across to me this is the most problematic section for me i m not sure what to recommend the original was clearer to me it could be the pronoun shift to we i m not sure about broken circle maybe the link between the mother image and the experience needs to be connected more i feel like i m rambling a bit so i ll move on to hold it gently there was a bird fallen and you held it s shivering flesh in your child hand incomprehensible this but you were alive enough to feel the change when the small body stiffened you knew you had touched permanence a passing your passing into this knowledge i still like the first line to me it harkens back to the raindrops and the fragility of life the image works well i like the shorter lines let s focus on incomprehensible this this phrase just seems too old for me for the moment i don t want the narrator to insert it in i want to stay in the moment and watch the innocence dissolve in the first version you used the phrase too young maybe something along those lines could work here this might be too dramatic of a line break but i wonder if you knew should have its own line the rest of it works well for me i like the ending i miss the small stone image from the first version but fully agree with the cuts you made here one structural question did you have a reason to begin capitalizing your lower section s first words but not your upper section if there was a reason i missed it just wondering i hope some of this helps i really like this poem and i appreciate you posting it thank you  The Amber Spyglass Milton H.

i don't understand the poem a song on the end of the world http www peakdesign com peak ram polsong htm this is the poem i don't understand this poem at all what is the writer trying to say please write an alanysis for me so i can understand the poem i just read the poem and think that its beautiful now i'm no expert and not even remotely qualified to analyse a poem i only love poems and enjoy reading writing them but if were to guess at the meaning i would say that it has alot to do with what he feels about his surroundings at that time i mean it being the end of ww and in warsaw where alot of people were persecuted i guess anyone would have thoughts of the world's end or impending doom but despite all of those negative factors that were undoubtedly going on he still has a pretty positive outlook i think if he can write about such mundane and serendipitous things as animals' activities music floating to the heavens and a sailboats narrowing proximity to some island it also sends the subliminal and timeless message that no matter what life goes on and that the main theme is disguised a bit by the obvious theme that the end of the world here refers to the war and the words the prophetic old man repeats no other end of the world there will be this i believe is the hope of the writer that there shall never more be a war of such magnitude or this could all just be his the writer's notion of how the end of the world will be not like what is always predicted in holy books and sci fi movies that instead of chaotic uncontrollable storms or cryptic signs there will just be a simple even gentle expiration of the world almost unnoticed by all except the other worldly wise individuals quite like one dies peacefully in their sleep contented and painless  Four Quartets Book of Isaiah Christian eschatology A Course In Miracles Anne Rice Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief The nature of God in Western theology Poetry The writing of Principia Mathematica Yehuda Halevi Science Leonard Cohen E.

an artists statement you may wonder why is a person so critical if you want to pursue writing like golf or another distant hobby then do so if you want to be serious you take your writing to the most critical person you know hemingway for instance sought out gertrude stein for the very sake of tearing his writing to pieces which by the way she did mercilessly and hemingway grow so broadly so fast that he thanked her eternally for her help if i come across as full of hubris or condescending its because i have already endured years of criticism and i wish to expose those here who seek real constructive criticism that will give them opposing perspective to the voice of the devil's advocate it's nothing personal its not an ego trip as i once thought it to be with my mentors its for the sake of what's on the page which is all that matters to someone who really gives a damn about producing quality lines go in peace i respect and criticize everyone i read this was written in response to someone calling me out for being a dick because they openly supported a poem i thought was ego obsessed and they aired private communiques in a public forum to make me look like a dick i really care but im not that nice you can get nice at subway toasted i don't disagree with your comments here if someone wants to get better at a skill they need critique from people that know what they're talking about i've seen a few of your critiques and they seem to be very constructive i actually think you're pretty fair with them you seem to focus on one or two things that the writer can work on i mean it's pointless to show everything wrong in a piece people can only revise according to their skill level hemminway was a genius he likely had great skills when he went to stein so he could benefit from the ruthless detail in the critique when i think of my own writing i'm still gaining the skills necessary to understand the critique i expect improvement to come in stages not because my ego couldn't handle it all at once but because i frankly wouldn't benefit from the critique fully my skills are laboring to catch up ya fundamentally isn't a workshop site some people use it for that but in most cases do you like my poem means please affirm what i'm feeling and me as a person i pass over most vanity posts i only like commenting if i really see something interesting there or if i feel the person wants honest feedback to get better i know you sent something private and didn't expect it to be aired publically i can respect that in the defense of the other person though people comment for different reasons i don't feel that the individual in question panders or flatters he simply likes what he likes i am glad though that you do give good critiques in your comments we can use more people like that here those of us whose goal is to improve their writing  Theory of conduct Plame affair Extreme Programming Objectivist philosophy Goodness and value theory Supply-side economics Scientology beliefs and practices Libertarianism Capitalism Anarchism and capitalism John Howard Yoder Deconstruction Philosophy of language Intelligent design movement Property (ownership right) Teach the Controversy A Course In Miracles Liberalism Criticism of libertarianism Postmodernity Current teachings of Prem Rawat Gertrude Stein Religion Nicomachean Ethics Humphrey Bogart Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Immanuel Kant Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Transactional analysis Religious Society of Friends Internet troll Past teachings of Prem Rawat Ernest Hemingway Intelligent design William A.

what can a person studying english literary studies do after his or her education i want to study english literary studies as my discipline but i don't have anybody to counsel me p s help if u know you could get into teaching or maybe editing the vast majority of people work in careers that have nothing to do with their degree that is simply reality i may be in the minority on this opinion but employers mainly just want to see a degree any degree to show that you can stick it out at something unless you are going into engineering medicine etc something that needs a particular degree in most cases you take your degree not for employment but for self enrichment the market doesn't care if you enjoyed bronte or thought that joyce was interesting it simply doesn't value those skills that doesn't make them unimportant though i'm all for studying what you are interested in but realize that that may not open any particular career door talk to a counselor at the school you will be attending ask about internships in your chosen career you may love the subject but hate the work you may love english but hate having to do classroom discipline and lesson plans so teaching might not make you happy i think using an internship to try out what you want to do is almost a thousand times more important than the degree you get just my thoughts best of luck to you  Juris Doctor School counselor Columbia University Education in the United States Education in Germany Church of Christ, Scientist Graduate school Education in Portugal Psychoanalysis Lawyer Medical school Cooperative education Education in Taiwan General practitioner Past teachings of Prem Rawat Psychology Law school College Tai Chi Chuan Intelligent design Chinese University of Hong Kong Teacher Novel Secondary education in Japan Theory of conduct Education in Japan Software engineering Deprogramming Master's degree Epistemology Homeschooling Victorian literature Avenue Q Education in Australia Economics Philosophy of education Electrical engineering Teach the Controversy Experiential education Equal Protection Clause Apprenticeship A Course In Miracles Rudolf Hermann Lotze Consensus decision-making Medicine Intern Brooke Foss Westcott Kodocha Psychotherapy Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Education in the People's Republic of China Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Narrator New Age Rudolf Steiner Theodicy Paralegal Nurse Jewish studies Theodore Beza Education Traumatic incident reduction Transactional analysis Second language acquisition Education in Hong Kong NUMB3RS Academia Bulgarian language Milton H.

what do you think of this poem a father s nightmare how can this rage not explode when i see her eyes looking but not seeing fixed but wandering she s everywhere but here seeking refuge where i don t exist or where i am dead or just a twig she feeds to the flame blue with her wrath she has mastered the contours of my anger and i still grope along the fence of her defense isn t silence sweet then why the muteness my voice has summoned drown me now where is the shore of this imploding sea of silence how can a clever plan fail trap her in a minor encounter where even her faintest meow is enough to unlock her lies and the torrents of diatribes i have long nurtured but how can i bear her empty stare her frozen gaze that sets me ablaze o how i seethe seeing her lips smirk i love it  Darth Vader Characters of Naruto Slayers Odyssey Blood (computer game) Shaggy dog story Sacrifice (computer game) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Ranma __ characters Sin City Night (book) Naruto jutsu Happy Tree Friends Saruman Races in the Warcraft universe Mahou Sentai Magiranger Transformers: Cybertron The Amber Spyglass Concepts in the Wheel of Time series Virtual Realm The Shining (film) The Venture Bros.

do you like my poem the flash of a lens the glint of your eyes the tears are a godsend compared to what you feel inside your heart is broken your spirit lies in pieces there are so many things unspoken the pain of it never ceases exhausted from thinking afraid to admit that you feel slowly yet surely your fire is shrinking at the same time everything and nothing feels real passion struggles inside of you anger and sorrow burst within yet you hold them back to make it through it s all under that china doll skin you keep your walls up and your spirit down too weak for smiles too strong for help so you struggle through without a sound when inside you melt you don t have to stand alone you don t have to do it by yourself you re walking into a whole world of unknown everyone s been there himself we ll all go hand in hand and your hurt will slowly pass away your shredded heart will mend strand by strand it might not happen tomorrow or today but eventually you can be that happy person buried so deep inside and then you will hold the golden key to everything in this life and it may seem totally bizarre and you might never agree but not so long ago that hurt person that you are was also me this is beautiful i like it more than the first poem u posted  Jon Secada The Amber Spyglass Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Vegeta Cliff Richard The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Scenes from a Memory The Death Gate Cycle Pitaten One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule Dualism (philosophy of mind) Naruto jutsu The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Sydney Riot of 1879 EastEnders Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Milton H.

i wrote a poem appreciate it hate it whatever you please it's more aggressive but i like it anyway that isn't the question though the question is whether you do tell me what you think raise your hand if you re tired of the same old sh t raise your hand if you want it all to just quit raise your hand if your blood is burning and your soul is always and forever churning with questions unanswered and tales untold with the trials and tribulations of the young and the old raise your hand if you ve never been sold to a myth that the world is anything but cold raise your hand take a stand and never fold the streets run red with violence and crime your life can stop at the turn of a dime if someone just chooses to make it so raise your hand if you want something to change raise your hand if you don t think it is out of your range open your ears if you want to know how to end it open your eyes to see what is so clearly defined to all those that choose not to be blind stand up take a stand be a little bold let them know that you are not among the sold let them know that you demand something different something good others will rise when they see that you stood damn oh well i will admit defeat lots of cliches in here tales untold turn of a dime take a stand the repetition is unforgiving no i don't like it it's not that you can't rhyme clearly you can you just need to work harder to say what you mean i actually don't disagree with your message you're caught up in a sort of universal call to action but your words are not original if you feel really strongly about this and it appears that you do work harder at saying it in a way that is fresh  Poker jargon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theory of conduct Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!

what do you think of this quote i wrote i poison my lips with anger and hatred and so do my life suffer with revengeful attacks well two things quotes are things said by someone that others felt significant enough to remember so it's a bit pretentious to write your own quote if you wanted to say what i think you wanted to say i'd consider editing it so it looked like this i poison my lips with anger and hatred and suffer my life with revengeful attacks your meaning has depth keep it concise and maybe it will be quoted  Force (Star Wars) Obi-Wan Kenobi Benny Morris Humphrey Bogart Sesshomaru The Merchant of Venice Blood on the Tracks Phobia Days of our Lives Notable lines in the Star Wars series Read my lips: no new taxes Solar Element Saga The Catcher in the Rye A Course In Miracles Hamlet Irna Phillips StarCraft: Uprising Sagat Lightsaber combat Mahatma Gandhi Padm__ Amidala Homunculi of Fullmetal Alchemist Nancy Witcher Astor W.I.T.C.H.

i am looking for a poem or writing by i believe henry david thoreau i remeber it talking about an adults influence in the life of a child it stated that the only important thing was to influence the life of a child in order to be a succesful adult i know this is very vague but i would appreciate any help in knowing the title or some info on it thanks i went through a lot of thoreau looking for the passage your alluding to it doesn't sound really familliar to me but i love a good mystery so i gave it a try these are thoreau's books walden the maine woods cape cod and essays civial disobedience life without principal slavery in massachusetts a plea for captin john brown walking you can access all of them here http thoreau eserver org default html one of my favorite chuncks of thoreau for what it's worth is from walden and coincidentally it discusses children or the state of childhood and innocence we may imagine a time when in the infancy of the human race some enterprising mortal crept into a hollow in a rock for shelter every child begins the world again to some extent and loves to stay outdoors even in wet and cold it plays house as well as horse having an instinct for it who does not remember the interest with which when young he looked at shelving rocks or any approach to a cave it was the natural yearning of that portion any portion of our most primitive ancestor which still survived in us from the cave we have advanced to roofs of palm leaves of bark and boughs of linen woven and stretched of grass and straw of boards and shingles of stones and tiles at last we know not what it is to live in the open air and our lives are domestic in more senses than we think from the hearth the field is a great distance it would be well perhaps if we were to spend more of our days and nights without any obstruction between us and the celestial bodies if the poet did not speak so much from under a roof or the saint dwell there so long birds do not sing in caves nor do doves cherish their innocence in dovecots best of luck i covered the above mentioned texts i'd look in his letters if it's him at all  Walden Literature of the United States Gary Snyder Ralph Waldo Emerson Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Transcendentalism Shaggy dog story John the Baptist Time Out of Mind Civil disobedience Anarcho-capitalism Stone Age Cat New England Philosophy of language Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Pitaten Francis Bacon (painter) Storytelling Walt Whitman Discworld gods Paul of Tarsus Charles Dickens Origin belief Phaedo House of Leaves Second language acquisition Cave Theory of conduct Comanche Beat generation Franciscan Dog The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Poetry of the United States Gothic rock Oh My Goddess!

can you criticize my poem hey guys this is a poem i wrote about life in the city and the way america is all about rushing and not looking back enjoy and please criticize people are walking along the crowded streets they rush only stopping for the speeding cars they rush past the poor musician playing beautiful music for they are too busy going places the homeless man sits next to the musician thankful for his blanket as he searches for hope everyone is different here but they appear the same in their suits these crowded streets could be more than just a city these rushed people cry out to be more more than a blur of unspoken colors each one has an unheard story an america that is hidden untouched i am young but i have seen the people walking along the crowded streets some envy how fast these people walk i envy the homeless man who walks slowly i like your poem very much much truth is revealed in your poem as you are very observant the last line i envy the homeless man who walks slowly leaves me wondering why you envy that person a homeless person has a story a reason for ending up in the streets he walks slowly because he has been effected by a hard life perhaps or an injury in a war the fast walking fast paced person could walk through life without seeing anything or anyone around them focused only on their own personal goal or gain but for myself i do not envy the homeless man i may have respect for him if i got to know his story or have sympathy for him i might say i hold no interest for those moving in the fast lane but the homeless man has captivated my attention he walks slowly but his eyes are open to the world around him and he feels something hopes for something and watches for a sign of change i am not suggesting you change your poem just offering my take on the subject your ending left me wanting more reason for your envy of a homeless man  Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Swingout The Shining (film) Milton H.

comments on this poem self image you don t know me this is what you know my hair held captive against my head does not cascade down my back it lays listlessly a nest uncombed my skin is blemished and stained scarred and bruised same as my name it is not pure like milk my poems do not resonate they flit about like a firefly easily contained in the palm of your hand they are let go and forgotten mere acquaintances my voice cannot hit every high note it breaks instead like glass i reach down and pull the low notes out of my belly they feel slippery between my fingers i quiver even on the middle c of i love you and you are disappointed and i am disappointed i really liked this again it felt like plath to me this feels like the strongest poem out of the one's you've posted today it's really good i like what you did with the voice and the glass i like how it was the voice breaking rather than the glass that was very well done great ending my only issue in each strophe you deal with an area of the body except when you deal with my poems i think it would be better if you could keep it more linked to your body somehow that's it this one has a ton of potential it is really good thanks for sharing all of your work today  Diving Double bass Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation Violin Suplex Timpani Glass InuYasha (character) The Inside Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Pet Sounds 613 mitzvot Professional wrestling throws Garth Brooks Professional wrestling attacks Harp Poker jargon Butterfly stroke Bong Yoko Ono Anchor Naval mine Physical attractiveness The Doors Sub-Zero Cleveland Browns Hall & Oates Swimming Salad Fingers G-Man (Half-Life) Hand The Caves of Androzani Skin Japanese poetry Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Platypus Sylvia Plath Rudyard Kipling Sin City Madonna (entertainer) Volleyball United Airlines Flight 93 Knife Sesshomaru Pittsburgh Steelers The Shining (film) Bon Jovi Poetry Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Jon Secada Cello Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Nineteen Eighty-Four Milk Philadelphia Eagles Slow Train Coming Birthmark HTML element The Ashlee Simpson Show Cascade Range Guy Sigsworth Cascading Style Sheets Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Four Quartets Dragon Booster Tina Turner Homunculi of Fullmetal Alchemist Sephiroth (Final Fantasy VII) Physical characteristics of the Buddha Rod Stewart Fast bowling The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show Elephant Space elevator Inspector Gadget Characters in the Smurfs Samurai Deeper Kyo Snake Breastfeeding Cliff Richard Treehouse of Horror XV Gesture Mattress Spanking Bigfoot Twelve Swords of Power John Berryman Backstroke W.I.T.C.H.

comments on my untitled poem please also ideas for a title i m tired of hearing that guitar i m empty of flame tipped roses cigarettes faith in the healing powers of god and loneliness a sky that looked hung with jewels but up close just stabbed with holes done with sun soaked jeeps goatees cucumber eyes and my mother s advice even though in this case she was right also ice music bacardi diamonds the ocean and all things you now play me another song a great poem linz i have been reading all of the ones you posted and i wanted to specifically comment on this one because you asked for a title first let me say this do not listen to anyone about your poems there are no you should have done this in the beginning or you need to make your symbolism a little more clearer when you discuss the second stanza type of comments that have anything applicable to a poem a poem is something for you it is for you to put a feeling into words so dont listen to someone else telling you that you put your feelings down wrong you have some incredible talent poems are picky as to who they allow to like them if someone does not like it then that poem is just not for them dont change it to please some because it will end up not pleasing others thats not what it is about i can promise you that poe never wrote a poem and then changed it to please someone else let the words fall out of you and fall where they may if it makes sense to you then thats all that matters once again you have incredible talent and you can paint some very incredible pictures feelings emotions about this moment in time that you catch in your poems and just like some paintings not everyone will get them if vincent van gogh decided that he needed to paint more like michelangelo simoni then the world would be a boring place imagine someone saying hey vince i dont get this painting you call the starry night i mean your moon is more like a sun and what the heck is with this big spire right in the left center of the picture you should change it laughable isnt it this poem paints a good picture same ol' song and dance keep up the great work  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Blood on the Tracks Shaggy dog story Four Quartets Vincent van Gogh Jacques-Louis David Ocean's Twelve Time Out of Mind Sharon Tate Ayyavazhi mythology The Subtle Knife Jon Secada Poetry Origin belief Michelangelo The Raven Empire Burlesque Storytelling Hey Jude Art Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Paul Is Dead World Championship Wrestling Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Atomism Cliff Richard A Day in the Life Planet Waves Atomic Kitten Jennifer Lopez Vishnu Piccolo Junior Saga Jack Kerouac God Emperor of Dune Sin City Bon Jovi Discworld gods Infidels Social rule Rich Mullins The Dalek Invasion of Earth W.I.T.C.H.

what do you think of my poem the body brain synapses spectrum maps loops of immune tubing that houses a well groomed flu so much to it but i don't think on it i forgot i out grew it what is the body of mine complicated and yet at the same time truly sublime when i see my body as it is am i seeing it resting upon a different plane the first person view where we feel we can't ask how because we're not allowed the rest the guts and fat simmering in an electric blood stained vat is just the underlying magical construction meaningless except to sound alarms of potential flaws in our final state which makes all of us including god content the rest is just merely the buildup to the work of art that we are it's so hard to believe that our body was concieved within the pulsing of a star that poem was so deep i iiked it because i actually had to think about the meaning cool  Action potential Pneumonia Chronic fatigue syndrome Bass guitar Synapse Cerebellum Immune system Influenza Cyberspace Urinary incontinence Electrophysiology Carbon dioxide Shark Vitamin C Brain Nutrition Malaria Long-term potentiation Magnetic resonance imaging Blood pressure Electromagnetic field House music Computer Cephalic disorder Warm-blooded Neuron Brewery Death W.

i would like to publish but i have one poem not a dozen but one i've read through the suggestions but mostly i get you should publish with a book of your own work i doubt one poem is worth that sort of effort can you see a one page book out there i understand that it's not necessary to copyright but where can i go a trustworthy place to publish one poem hi dahlias everybody starts with one that's a given i've known some poets who can take a long time between poems they've learned not to rush their process if you want your one poem published then send it to a magazine keep sending it out keep reading other people's poems in the meantime like in the magazines you are thinking of sending to then you'll probably find yourself inspired to write another poem side note stay away from reading work here i say that because this place has no editor and so you haven't seen work that has gone through any kind of publishing process good luck  Japanese poetry Objectivist poets Michael Drayton H.D.

poetic ramble for your amusement or not the lonely amoeba i am innocent blood spilled an acid washed dream fear in a victims eye i am what you cannot uncreate the unforgivable act an emptied womb i am yours forever a mistake this poem almost made me cry it's very beautiful i think it could describe an abortion as one of the answerers here said but i also think it could describe a number of things even situations with your parents depending on your view on it it's very heart felt and it grasps the reader from the the first line i am is always a good way to begin a poem simply because it grasps peoples attention and they are curious to know what you are it paints a very good image and uses a plentiful amount of imagery which is vital in order to make a poem a success i think you went all out and used all elements of poetry to make this poem a complete success keep writing  Poetry Anne Rice Macbeth Soul Aesthetic Realism E.

the second coming by w b yeats what are your opinions about this poem what exactly is the second coming all about in this poem by yeats spread smiles thanks everyone for your answers love u all my interpretation yeats wrote the second coming while europe and much of the rest of the world was trying to recover from world war i this was surely an important factor for him in writing the poem yeats saw great social troubles all around him and remarks on a world spinning out of control line hints at technology progressing beyond mankind's ability to control it the problem was evident to yeats years ago and the problem has worsened since then yeats shows his concern that technology has advanced to the point where mankind can do a great deal of harm with relative ease the world had never seen destruction of the likes of world war i and most people were shocked at the extensive loss of human life during the war in the time that yeats speaks of the rulers of the world were caught up in imperialism and expanding circles of power to the point where they would do almost anything to accomplish their goals the ruthless power mongers were outspoken and numerous and there seemed to be few who dared to speak out against them in the name of peace at one point it stated here that spiritus mundi is a medieval text for christians to inform them what they need to do to die in the grace of god it is essentially the art of dying well at this point the text that deals with the art of dying well is in fact ars moriendi spiritus mundi is literally spirit of the world nevertheless i believe spiritus mundi leads yeats to propose that perhaps the second coming of christ is near at hand judgement day the end of the world spiritus mundi brings an image of the sphinx to yeats' mind yeats sees the sphinx rising up to bring forth the end of the world the sphinx slept in a world of nightmares for years the nightmares were caused by the turmoils of the human race line the indignant desert birds line a k a humans who foresee the second coming try to stop the sphinx the end of the world but their task is impossible in the end yeats reveals no hope for the continued existence of mankind  The Second Coming (poem) Christianity William Butler Yeats Eastern Orthodox Church Christian eschatology End times Original sin Magic (paranormal) A Course In Miracles The nature of God in Western theology Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Scientology beliefs and practices Salvation Urantia Book of Revelation Justification (theology) Apocalyptic literature The Pilgrim's Progress Simone Weil Roman Catholic Church Holy Spirit Immortality Supernatural Religion John Howard Yoder W.I.T.C.H.

any comment final flight of light sunday morning your voice slid a slice of light into my eyes your smile dusted the debris of memos and bills off my shoulders and i wished the time to stand still so that i could cling to the tender laughter in your eyelashes so that i could lay my head on your tiny thighs and listen to the riddles rivuleting from your tongue riddles that yesterday were rattled and clipped by the anger that oozed from my eyes mouth and fist a beast that refused the warm breeze brought by the sea of your why s a how i wished i could tie the sun and lift it above the hills a little longer i still would like to play with you to annoy you to say sorry and to sleep embracing you my child but the dusk has already fluffed its wings the wind has whistled the final flight of light to art flood thanks for the suggestion but my intention is not just tying and lifting the sun a little longer yes it's an important image and emotion but as you can see in the poem the experience i want to convey is much much richer than what your suggestion can capture that was very deep and powerful it uplifted me in my time of need you should get it published  Samson Sesshomaru Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling holds Shen Gong Wu Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Apollo 11 Gesture Odyssey Emoticon Comet Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Kyoryuu Sentai ZyuRanger Aerial (dance move) The Hobbit Happy Tree Friends Casualty lifting Sin City Conan the Barbarian The Venture Bros.

feedback on creative writing piece it's been quite a while since i last wrote something but i would still like some feedback thanks in advance time in a bottle i trudge down the stairs listening to the lonely echo of my footsteps reverberating off the metallic colors of the hallways if i could save time in a bottle the soft acoustic guitar and gentle soothing male vocals flowed from eardrum to eardrum i walk the school hallways alone the bell had long past purred its final hum however the seconds the minutes the time seems to slowly pass by classes have ended and the innumerable students have slowly emptied the hallways with their chatter and vulgar obscenities i could feel the murmur of depression and hesitation thumping away in my chest like the madman s head against the padded surface of his cell door the first thing that i d like to do i fear running into him he always stays a bit after school then i see him coming up the stairs how could i not i stand still attempting to blend in with the inanimate objects of the stairwell he stares blankly at me with dark brown depths of uncertainty there is a moment of communication between us one of silence and a friendship breaking he looks away from me and continues up the stairs i am invisible to him now i do not exist then in my heart i know i know i ll never look into those brown eyes again and be filled with comfort and safety it s getting difficult to see now my vision is blurred by stairs windows and tears creating a marble esque painting before my eyes is to save every day that eternity passes away i don t think i ll ever get over this one i think to myself in between each teardrop careening down my face actually the technique of book ending this piece with croce's lyrics was very nicely done overall this piece needs to be tightened up you don't need innumerable not to mention the number is finite vulgar with obscenities sounds redundant obscenities would do the line i could feel the murmur of his cell door was nicely done but i had to read it twice could be a punctuation thing not sure you don't need a bit i could go on i just think you've got a nice skeleton here that needs editing and maybe some new flesh  Shaggy dog story Columbine High School massacre Time Out of Mind Empire Burlesque Blood on the Tracks Pet Sounds Stairway The Shining (film) Glass Combine (Half-Life 2) Sin City A Day in the Life Milton H.

when we two departed what does this poem make you think of okay so when i first read this poem i fell in love with it what does it make you think of when we two departed when we two parted in silence and tears half broken hearted to sever for years pale grew thy cheek and cold colder thy kiss truly that hour foretold sorrow to this the dew of the morning sank chill on my brow it felt like the warning of what i feel now thy vows are all broken and light is thy fame i hear thy name spoken and share in its shame they name thee before me a knell to mine ear a shudder comes o'er me why wert thou so dear they know not i knew thee who knew thee too well long long shall i rue thee too deeply to tell in secret we met in silence i grieve that thy heart could forget thy spirit deceive if i should meet thee after long years how should i greet thee with silence and tears lord byron freezes me absolutely and scares me how can anything be more painful than having to stay in the shadow for both love and death and what can be more painful than the fact that sometimes you cannot make the difference between love and death besides there's a good question why wert thou so dear don't we always wonder that but i find it absolutely wonderful the way the poet brings together light and darkness past and future or a future that is nothing but a continnuous rememberance of the past and how subtle he keeps the silence the secret with every word but then it's lord byron  Ten Commandments Matthew 5 Jon Secada Bhagavad Gita Shakespeare's sonnets Virgin Mary in Islam Fallen angel Amidah Thou Joseph of Arimathea David and Jonathan Requiem Stabat Mater The Dunciad Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eternal Father, Strong to Save Conversion of Dale-Gudbrand Hamilton College Newfoundland The Amber Spyglass Yehuda Halevi O Canada Darth Vader Wiccan Rede Weapons of Middle-earth Trinity James Forrestal God Save the Queen Scenes from a Memory Kain (Legacy of Kain) Apostasy Hidden Words Gospel of Barnabas Rabindranath Tagore Slayers Mary, the mother of Jesus Hamlet Time Out of Mind The Subtle Knife Shaggy dog story Book of Isaiah Rowland Taylor Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Contrition Psychopannychism Famous last words Tulane University George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron Sin City Vampire fiction Carrie Jacobs-Bond Socrates W.I.T.C.H.

what is your new opinion i changed my th stanza form my fist draft and would like to hear what you have to say i have an idea for a title as well but if you would like to contribute as you travel on the path you are not alone for a barrier has been drawn that time in moments will stall neither true night nor true day will ever prevent me returning once again to my full glory as the dusk of night falls return to the path of normality i will be there though not in clarity for in the moments that swiftly pass look close you may see released dreams awaken to reality knowing i am truly free set upon for a moment hidden as the sun controls not fearing for knowing as the moon takes her hold for twice rising then twice falling always in full glory i am all passing again times wasteful friend returning again the marrows end word edit sp form to from i like your poems but the first stanza of this one leaves me confused i'm not sure how you get from you are not alone to for a barrier has been drawn that time in moments will stall this is not like you are there a few missing lines how does having a barrier make you not alone especially one that has been drawn in time that in moments will stall i'm not even sure what that means your second stanza's uneven meter is created by the first line too many beats and the last syllable of glory is not an upbeat like me was check it out again the poem moves on and i see where i think you were going with this but it isn't one of your best i'd suggest you start over it's just my opinion and i'm sure others will disagree but you need to edit pretty much every stanza and line the marrows end you can do better than this and you usually do i suspect you had a good vision of what you wanted to write put something down to capture it then posted before you had a good chance to go over it i'd work on it a little while longer picture what you want to say picture a beginning and an end and what you need to do to draw a straight line between the two i'd love to see the rewrite keep writing  Surrealist techniques Poker jargon Alliterative verse Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Hunting of the Snark Time Out of Mind Poetry John Berryman Empire Burlesque Meter (poetry) Nashville Skyline Children of Dune Milton H.

poem wording does it make sense to say two peoples' meeting was a chance meet technically a chance meet is grammatically correct since meet can function as a noun here described by the adjective chance but the more common english and also grammatically correct usage is a chance meeting the phrase refers to an encounter influenced by happenstance or fate but the earlier respondent is correct if you're thinking about using that phrase in your writing you have to be careful about using the phrase especially in poems about relationships since it is such a cliche better to describe the surprise of the moment than write that the moment was a surprise i e show don't tell i'm just speculating here but if you're asking if a chance meet makes sense because you want to match a rhyme word with meet in a poem you are writing my opinion is that it is a poor aesthetic choice in contemporary poetry to subvert natural english vernacular to force an obvious rhyme if you want to check out two notable contemporary poets who are accomplished at writing rhyme without losing a sense of a natural english speaking style check out richard wilbur or donald justice  Poetry Shit English language Literature Written Cantonese Waka Indian English Chinese language Vietnamese language Philosophy of language Translation Meter (poetry) Preposition God and gender American and British English differences Political correctness Pleonasm English grammar Adjective New Zealand English Esperanto grammar Rhyme Grammatical mood Name English poetry Alliterative verse Bulgarian language Spanish verbs Spanish nouns Syriac language Adverb Existence Beat generation Greek language RAS syndrome Article (grammar) English plural Esperanto as an international language Japanese grammar Dutch language Finnish grammar Hiberno-English Pronoun Robert Creeley Grammatical gender Taiwanese (linguistics) Relative clause Cockney rhyming slang Singlish Haiku English literature Meaning Chinglish Tamil language Geoffrey Chaucer Portuguese language King James Version of the Bible Nonsense verse Grammatical number E.

yet another poem rate it i've lowered my substandards my requirements are mediocre but my pain runs deep and my desires become eternal deliverance is a long task littered with the becomings of failure it's okay the first thing i noticed was lowered my substandards i think just standards would be better either that or something about accepting substandard you can't really lower your substandards since they could go infinitely low i also think you could include some more images in your poem show more instead of just telling us in general i'm not really sure how well the poem fits together what does your pain have to do with your low standards what desires are becomming eternal what are you being delieverd from i'm not saying you have to directly answer all of the questions i mentioned but it's just something to think about i know i sound a bit critical but hopefully my feedback will help you as you revise your poem i think it has potential so don't get discouraged and give up on it i particularly love the last lines deliverance is a long task littered with the becomings of failure not quite sure what the becomings of failure are but it's a beautiful line again i hope you don't take my critique the wrong way just trying to give you some honest feedback hopefully i've helped and you don't think i'm too horrible for picking apart your poem feel free to completely disregard me if you'd like poetry is subjective so if you really like your poem the way it is don't let me discourage you as for the rating a out of maybe a i don't know something around there  Extreme Programming Phaedo Four Quartets Theory of conduct Poetry Microeconomics Yoga Sutras of Patanjali The Apprentice 2 Scientology beliefs and practices GED Perl Summa Theologiae Test plan Stuttering Sexual orientation Appeal Keynesian economics Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Das Lied von der Erde Supply-side economics Fernando Pessoa Property (ownership right) S__ren Kierkegaard A Course In Miracles Equine conformation Standard Mandarin Atomism Mortification of the flesh Aesthetic Realism Simone Weil Intelligent design C.

a poem about hate bile stuck in the back of my throat bitter nasty horrible taste people preconcieve too fast black and brown and yellow too why do we hate try to see the good in each i don't understand why someone would choose to taste the pure bile of hate your title would be better if it included the word hate as in taste of hate perhaps people preconcieve too fast preconceive is to have a notion before something happens i think you may mean in the context of your poem prejudge or even make snap judgments or make judgments but not preconcieve why do we hate try to see the good in each these two lines seem like pieces of an idea not the idea itself you need to work on them maybe why do we hate instead of seeing the good or something along those lines or if you wanted a true contrast to the bitterness of hate you could have said something that used the word sweet or good the pure bile of hate is a weak phrase because it mixes images that are already fixed in our heads i know what you were going for but it didn't work the way it should try again with different images that's my best advice and keep writing  Goodness and value theory Poetry Bile Structuralism Roger Ebert's most hated films Iago Tobacco Art Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Color theory Beer Rum Moral objectivism Atomism Georges-Pierre Seurat Synaesthesia Michael Drayton Species Placebo (band) Ontological argument The Rutles Mahatma Gandhi Book of Isaiah Shit Dark Ages Hate speech David Hume Justification (theology) Head of state Drawing Philosophy of language Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Immanuel Kant Cultural relativism Merit The nature of God in Western theology Ty Cobb Supply and demand Theodicy Paradise Lost Existence Bread Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Alignment (role-playing games) Novel Fast bowling John Wycliffe Amiga Power Vodka Bollocks Chinese language Surrealist techniques Empire Burlesque John Howard Yoder Japanese poetry Atheism Bill Stevenson Blood on the Tracks Leonard Cohen The Adventures of Pete & Pete Michel Henry One Tree Hill (TV series) Glossary of American football Hypnosis The Young Ones (TV series) Dispensationalism Classical music era Jews as a chosen people Rigging Kasparov versus The World Grammatical mood Heuristic Culture Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Paradox God Infidels White (people) Origin belief Nine Inch Nails Anti-Defamation League Aphasia Max Stirner Theatre Critique of Judgment Rhyme Hildegard of Bingen Das Lied von der Erde French Defence Andr__ Ch__nier Ethics Harvey Award Time Out of Mind Translation Critique of Pure Reason Color I Am the Walrus

think you want to read be my guest my beloved across the endless sea you've gone across to heaven's shore i cannot feel your silken touch i'll see your face no more for now i'll miss you next to me and have for several years my sorrow that you're gone from me has caused me many tears i miss the way you looked at me i miss your nose so cute i miss the sunlight in your hair i sometimes feel i'm mute the years i had so fleeting few to gather next to me the memories of a lifetime so in my mind i'd see the sparkles in your eyes so blue the golden hair so fine the perfumed scent i loved so much when you were only mine i must stay here yet for a time but there will come a day when i will meet you by the gate and then with each we'll stay no more to part nor turn our backs our spirits will entwine as one we'll spend eternity for you i'll cease to pine yes sad but sadness always makes beautiful poetry it was i who was lucky a beautiful poem well written and with pretty consistent meter and rhyme stanza line try sometimes i feel i'm mute or sometimes i'm almost mute this would change the last line so it wasn't as predictable by moving i into the phrase instead of at the beginning of it look at line in stanza and consider truly instead of only only works but it implies that now she belongs to someone else and you whereas truly would imply that she was more than just a memory that she was physically spiritually and mentally yours the next stanza again fourth line and then with each we'll stay perhaps where together forever we'll stay or when reunited forever we'll stay and finally too good to pass up consider revision of the last line where pine seems a little archaic try when again you'll truly be mine whether you choose to edit as i've recommended or not your poem is a lovely one and a very heartfelt one indeed may all your poems know such heart  Four Quartets Time Out of Mind Pitaten Eugene Onegin Hymn The Hunting of the Snark The Amber Spyglass Poetry Jon Secada Shakespeare's sonnets Waka Dean Koontz Das Lied von der Erde Meter (poetry) The Tale of Genji Scenes from a Memory Church of Christ, Scientist Characters in the Smurfs The Raven A Course In Miracles Cliff Richard Reincarnation Alliterative verse Characters of The Sandman E.

haiku for the heat i know many of you live in warmer climes but vermont infrequently climbs above the mark today it went above if it were possible to live in a meat locker i would consider it so here's my horray for the heat degrees in vermont heat stills the world like snowfall small breezes come through leaves become unhappy wind chimes dog pants lays at my feet sighs dry earth tinged air pulled expelled i shake my glass balsamic and raspberry rickey hides in ice book computer tinged with damp watering waits for later phone calls go ignored let thoughts laze pass by unharmed days pass winter will come this moment recalled here past history obscureb this is lovely i'm not going to suggest word changes because i don't often critique haiku and i don't want to suggest alterations to what is already well written but i do have to ask if it would be possible to recast yourself in the moment of this poem and say more outside of haiku i e write another poem using this as the basis but not in haiku something that allows you to expand you're so darned good at this maybe it is just the nature of haiku but so much feels unexplored for me here it as if there is unleashed potential in some of your lines maybe i am missing the point the observation of heat stilling the world like snowfall was an actual transportation for me it awoke me to the feeling of peace i feel in the winter when new snow has painted the dreary greys and browns of dormancy with the innocence just before new life emerges and i can hear the sandy sound of those hairs brushing across a drum's kettle as the leaves reiterate their presence in the breeze another transportation this one audible there is so much memory to this poem yet so much presence of the teller and the telling interesting to see the dry earth reaching up to touch the air instead of the air smothering it is that what you meant and i want that drink now and get yourself a sprinkler and for god's sake put a rotating fan on the patio and get ice cubes for that precious dog who for a brief moment reminded me exactly of you and right who would intercept thoughts on a day like today way too much effort which gets me to my next thought this looked effortless and i hope it was not because it had so many sensory elements about the ending and this is probably just me but after almost getting sensorily drunk reading this it was almost inconsequential i can't quite relegate what i experienced to here past history all in all a beautiful poem you belong at www criticalpoet com thanks for sharing this one margot  Haiku Severe weather terminology (United States) Blood on the Tracks Yoga Sutras of Patanjali G-Man (Half-Life) Time Out of Mind Milton H.

thoughts on charles simic the new u s poet laureate favorite poem reflections on his work i'm thrilled you asked i've been spending a lot of time with him lately er i mean his writing he actually got me back into writing before these last few days i hadn't written for about a year anyway onto your question i've been carrying the world doesn't end around with me for the last few weeks one of my favorites dear friedrich the world's still false cruel and beautiful earlier tonight i watched a chinese laundry man who doesn't read or write our language turn the pages of a book left behind by a customer in a hurry that made me happy i wanted it to be a dreambook or a volume of foolishly sentimental versus but i didn't look closely it's almost midnight now and his light is still on he has a daughter who brings him dinner who wears short skirts and walks with long strides she's late very late so he stops ironing and watches the street if not for the two of us there'd be only spiders hanging their webs between the streetlights and the dark trees this poem makes me happy to be  Time Out of Mind Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing Neil Gaiman The Catcher in the Rye The Ashlee Simpson Show C.

tell me what you think of my poem i'm not really into poetry that is happy go lucky so here is mine sad eyes of emptiness wither all beauty gone your bleeding heart in agony love eternal seems forever a misery let me feel all your pain we ll suffer in a sea of tears your ocean is too deep for me all wept away all swept away lay down with thorns of pity lay beside me the first two lines are lovely actually i like most of the lines individually a lot but to me the third and fourth line of the poem don't seem to flow and aren't as poetic as the rest of the poem it needs a title too but that's just my opinion i find things that i would change about some of my favorite poems that have been written by fantastic poets  Adam Mickiewicz Four Quartets John Berryman Alfred Edward Housman George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron Yehuda Halevi Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Shakespeare's sonnets Jon Secada Michael Drayton Emily Dickinson Time Out of Mind The Dunciad Biblical poetry H.D.

evanescence lyrics how do these lyrics sound in a poetic sense i linger in the doorway of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name let me stay where the wind will whisper to me where the raindrops as they're falling tell a story chorus in my field of paper flowers and candy clouds of lullabies i lie inside myself for hours and watch my purple sky fly over me don't say i'm out of touch with this rampant chaos your reality i know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge the nightmare i built my own world to escape in my field of paper flowers and candy clouds of lullabies i lie inside myself for hours and watch my purple sky fly over me swallowed up in the sound of my screaming cannot cease for the fear of silent nights oh how i long for the deep sleep dreaming the goddess of imaginary light in my field of paper flowers and candy clouds of lullabies i lie inside myself for hours and watch my purple sky fly over me your chorus has a very catchy quality to it but sky fly over me doesn't work for me usually a chorus will rhyme even when the verses do not and i think in this case they should do the same let's take a look in my field of paper flowers and candy clouds of lullabies i lie inside myself for hours and watch my purple sky fly over me it's that last line that needs work how about as over me my purple sky flies or as over me a purple sky flies the verses are a little uneven and might benefit from editing after you have someone else read them to you out loud so you can hear how they sound as written it's tough to do in your head because you cheat we all do good images love the chorus  The Amber Spyglass Shaggy dog story Time Out of Mind Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Poetry Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Alice's Adventures in Wonderland The Legend of Zelda series enemies American Beauty (album) Paul Is Dead Sin City The Marshall Mathers LP Roxette Song Milton H.

what do u think of this poem i wrote it in th grade im going into th now but i found it the other day and added it to my blog today here it is let me know what you think neverland here i am sitting on my speed boat in the middle of the atlantic ocean suddenly a ship full of angry pirates blasts itself against my boat causing sparks to erupt in desperation i jump out for fear of being burnt alive as i gasp for breaths in the cold ocean blue i see the maligning marauders escaping with my precious pet ducky how will i survive my only friend is gone while i slowly lose energy and am doomed to drowning thankfully a helicopter magically appears to save me from my fated future out jumps an amazingly gorgeous man who goes by the name of ken he hoists me up and we fly off to neverland where we get married and live happily ever after however my dreams are crushed when i realize i am sitting in a bathtub married to a doll named ken living alone i've gone a bit crazy my blog http www brightideasofateenager blogspot com im not making any changes because this was a poem from th grade and i want to leave it as is by the way this was the honors class i think the poem is cute and shows a vivid imagination that said you should keep it the way it is so you can look back on it as you get older and more experienced however listen closely now every poem benefits from editing every one if you want to keep this as it is because it's part of your past that's okay but you could keep this the way it is and still change a copy of it many poets do that they keep the original to refer back to and keep editing the copy until they either have a new poem or have made the original poem into something they want to share if you choose to post poems that you do not want to change then you are posting them just for entertainment and it really doesn't matter what we think if you post them so that the usual responses of you're great a genius etc come flying your way it is nothing but vanity but you're welcome to do that as well that however will not make you a better poet it will just give you an inflated ego that is not supported by your work that too is okay as long as you realize that is what you're doing otherwise when you post we assume you want feedback so that you can make your poem better and we offer suggestions on how you can change it if you don't want that just tell us up front that you don't care what we think and just wanted to share it with us but that you don't want advice on how to improve it we'll accept that read it and unless we really want to help you boost your ego simply move on to the next poem it's your call but it would be a shame if that's your choice you have a good imagination and a good use of language you could be a good poet if you decided to improve your poems instead of sealing them up the way you first wrote them again it's your call  Shaggy dog story W.I.T.C.H.

feeling poetic ok i need whoever feels like doing it to write a poem here's what it should be about it's about a girl who fell in love with this guy but she doesn't know if she should approach him or not because they live miles from each other but she knows that if she approaches him and they start a relationship they could only be together weeks and then they wouldn't see each other for a year but she also knows she will feel sorry if she doesn't find out how he feels about her she doesn't know what to do and she's sad and confused in the end she decides to approach him and find out how he feels now this is just basically what it should be about you don't have to stick to it strictly and you can add whatever you want it can be long or short it doesn't matter as long as it's romantic i hope someone will have a go at it i would appreciate it a lot of course points will go to the best poem i am wondering should i get up and run run from all the darkness of life in hopes that you are my sun or had i better let you go knowing my heart would be shattered and save myself a world of hurt though indeed this would leave me battered no i will run i will fly to you though i know i'll eventually fall for 'tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all  Friends Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Jon Secada Pitaten Blood on the Tracks Scenes from a Memory Charmed EastEnders Theory of conduct Kodocha Pok__mon Live!

why is li bai's silent night thoughts famous here is the poem in english night thoughts i wake up and moonbeams play around my bed glittering like hoarfroast to my wondering eyes uowards the glourious moon i raise my head then lay me down and thoughts of home arise you have to remember that li bai also known as li po or li pai lived between ad in the prosperous tang period of the tang dynasty ad this was considered the peak period of chinese poetry with almost poems created by poets do the math most poems were five to seven words per line li bai was given the title of 'heavenly poet' shih xian by the people and is considered the most influential and famous poet in chinese history his poems are romantic in style using hyperbolic language and imagery without making it seem excessive and are otherwise passionate and imaginative his poems cover a wide range of topics including politics nature social issues a more direct translation of his poem thoughts in the silent night jing ye si would be as follows the moon shines brightly above my bed frost is on the ground lifting my head up to the sky and see the bright moon i think of my hometown as i lower my head you can see by these two similar but different translations the problem associated with translating a poetic work but you can also see the beauty of poetry as it still paints a similar picture what you need to know is the wandering nature of the poets of the time imagine to wake up and see frost on the floor beside your bed what does that tell you about where he's sleeping the moon that he sees is there because there is no roof over his head again what does that tell you about where he's sleeping and finally it makes him think about his home or hometown as he lays back down to sleep what does that tell you about how he feels here is a lonely wandering poet sleeping outside with frost on the ground not sure about where he's going but missing where he's been and what he sees as his home yet he still was able to see and appreciate the beauty of the moonlight playing off the frost what does that tell you about his heart and the way he looks at life the ability to convey that much information in so few words is the essence of poetry which is why he's probably the most famous poet in chinese history at least of that time hope this answers your question  Poetry Chinese poetry Chinese art Li Bai Culture of China Samuel Taylor Coleridge Taoism William Shakespeare Fernando Pessoa Literature Miguel de Cervantes Anglo-Saxon literature Du Fu Guqin The Tale of Genji French literature of the 19th century Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Objectivist poets Poetic Edda Parsifal Das Lied von der Erde Fitz Hugh Ludlow Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Cao Cao Adam Mickiewicz English poetry Waka Yehuda Halevi English literature Beowulf W.I.T.C.H.

do you like this poem everyone surely has darkness hidden somewhere in their heart sometimes it prevents them from living as they wish we can't imagine other people's pain it's hard for us to share it but if i meet someone whom i really want to face i don't want to feel fear you shut the door of your heart with a violent noise and lost the key to open it a long time ago so please tell me exactly what you feel just with common words and with common expressions please let me hear it's so fearful to believe what is invisible and formless but if you can do so don't you feel it's wonderful even in the middle of such a grey city where you can hardly hold yourself together don't laugh so weakly with a resigned look as if to say such is life where is the person who could get what he wanted without making any sacrifices you see you have the thing which i long for which i had lost and will never get again however strongly i wish for it you shut the door of your heart with a violent noise and lost the key to open it a long time ago so please tell me exactly what you feel just with common words and with common expressions where is the person who could get what he wanted without making any sacrifices you see you have the thing which i long for which i had lost and will never get again however strongly i wish for it it's so dazzling to me yes i especially like the stanzas that begin with you shut the door of your heart with a violent noise i like this line too i like the beginning a little less because it is a kind of generalization and i prefer specific situations and characters in poetry  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Time Out of Mind Jon Secada Theory of conduct The Amber Spyglass Asperger syndrome Milton H.

will she kill me guarded the faces leaning flat elbows in corners lashed by raw shadows felled by the timbres of forests smiles sealing fissures in fables voiceless to hushed ears that listen in what silent pastures still rooted do wings render flight to the dusk and whispers on thresholds find answers to questions that die here unasked they wait at the sepulchral entrance to lie in the disengaged shadow and ask for the axe to be measured by dry sightless wells of their eyes arrested the throbs in the walls of the temple lungs no longer lift to the weight of their hunger strident the warning exhibit vortex of torn wings descending raping the tired broken harvest the bone from the marrow uncovered do waters still flow in the channels carved by the hard fisted muscle warmed by the noon sun that slumbers cooled by the black rains that follow the soles of feet find no comfort in following pathways of ashes the bones bend to taste a new blossom and bleed on an earth frozen over i ran out of space sure i've seen longer poems than this this is my sister's first poem you might compare it to the one i posted comments on this reflection what a difference in subject i'd appreciate your comments she has been published since this one on her behalf thank you mutya p she has been published doctor watson i also posted in philosophy for the creative answers in that category you should see of the first answers now she really will that was supposed to be the soles of old feet find no comfort moon thank you willow seemingly effortless rhythm that doesn't lag once that's what i thought having taken the seminar with her although i have no talent for poetry i understand how important voice is it needs to be read aloud for the music in it even if the metaphors aren't related to also this poem was published brandy b it is long i agree but consider some other poems of even greater length i agree with appeal to certain sort of folks that's the beauty of creativity the same thing doesn't appeal to everyone nor does it need to dr watson a critique from one who truly understands poetry now the worst of times to choose since this is growing whiskers lovely lovely lovely i especially enjoy the seemingly effortless rhythm that doesn't lag once rhythm is problematic in my writing so i love this especially read out loud it just rushes out of the mouth this is the sort of work i would love to read with a class and get everyone's perspective perhaps this will be read in poetry workshops someday it is that good and as i said a superb example of rhythm well done thanks for posting this psychic cat  Equine conformation Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story A Course In Miracles Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milton H.

poems rate them it's truly amazing how all the beauty on this green earth cannot even begin to compare to the beauty i see when i look in your eyes want me to tell you something as i walk around surrounded by the natural beauty of the world all i can think of is you and your dream of a face beautiful and perfect as only you can be i would compare you to a rose to the moon to the sun but though god made them each perfect none come close to you you must have been the masterpiece for i cannot find another being on this earth more deserving of the noun beautiful than you my love you're my first thought in the morning my last thought at night i dream of you by day and i think of you all night awake i lay just thinking about what we could be but knowing the whole while that you aren't for me and though i dream and fantasize by night by day by noon and even though i realize that you are my sun and moon and even though the sky is gray when you're around it's blue and though the grass is burnt and brown it's green when i'm with you i know that i can't have you and i lament this so because in your arms just to your arms is where i long to go i think that nd poem is better than st one i'll give nd poem st i liked nd poem because it has beautiful imagination  Mercury (planet) Moon Mid-Autumn Festival Frankie Laine Hipparchus (astronomer) Time Out of Mind Earth Extraterrestrial skies Navigation Carrie Jacobs-Bond Parallax Conan the Barbarian Paradise Lost Comet Hyakutake Scenes from a Memory Simone Weil Neptune Juliet Aesthetic Realism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Walter Savage Landor Rainbow Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Qiyamah Shaggy dog story Solar system Bhagavad Gita AFI 100 Years series Salad Fingers Characters of The Sandman The Amber Spyglass Aphrodite Horus Jupiter Fritz Leiber Frank Herbert Venus Miss Saigon Astronomy on Mars The Martian Chronicles German grammar A Canticle for Leibowitz Origin belief The Lovely Bones Dream Day Beatrice Portinari Cupid and Psyche Lucifer God and gender Vishnu Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Hanshan Harry Warren Yehuda Halevi Open cluster Haven (TNG episode) Diamond W.I.T.C.H.

poem of william shakespeare somebody can tell me where do i find this poem but the complete version after some time you learn the difference the subtle difference between giving a hand and fettering a soul and you learn that to love doesn't mean to support yourself and that company doesn't always means security and you start to accept you loss with your head up and eyes straight ahead with the grace of a grown up not the sadness of a child and that being flexible doesn't mean you are being weak or that you don't have a personality for no matter how delicate and fragil a situation is there are always two sides you find out that just because someone doesn't love you the way you want to be loved it doesn't mean that person doesn't know how to love and she loves you as much as she can because there are people who love you but simply don't know to show it william shakespeare not shakespeare you learn after some time you learn the difference the subtle difference between giving a hand and fettering a soul and you learn that to love doesn't mean to support yourself and that company doesn't always mean security and you learn that kisses are not contracts and that gifts are not promises and you start to accept your loss with your head up and eyes straight ahead with the grace of a grown up not the sadness of a child you learn to build the roads of today because tomorrow's land is too unknown to make plans and the future usually falls from nowhere after a while you learn that the sun burns if you expose yourself to it for very long and you learn that it doesn t matter how much you care some people just don t and you accept that it doesn t matter how good someone can be they will hurt you once in a while and you have to forgive them for that and you learn that talking can be a relief to emotional pain you learn that it takes years to build trust and just seconds to destroy it and you can do things in a second that you will regret for the rest of your life you learn that friendship continuous to grow even with the distance and that what matters is not what you have in life but who you are in life and you learn that you don t have to change friends if you understand that friends change and you realize that you and your friend can do nothing or everything and still have good times together and you learn that the people you care the most are taken away from you too fast that is why we should always say caring things to those we love because it might be the last time we see them and you learn that you shouldn t compare yourself to others but to the best you can become you learn that it takes a long time for you to become the person you want to be and that life is too short and you learn that it doesn't matter where you've already gotten to but where you are going and if you don't know where you're going anywhere will do you learn that either you control your acts or they will control you and that being flexible doesn't mean you are being weak or that you don't have a personality for no matter how delicate and fragile a situation is there are always two sides of it and you learn that heroes are those that did only what was necessary you learn that patience requires a lot of practice you find out that sometimes the person that you expect to kick you when you fall is one of the few that will help you up you learn that maturity is about what kind of experiences you ve had and what you ve learned from them not how many birthdays you have already celebrated you learn that there's more of your parents in you than you suppose you learn that you should never tell a child that dreams are foolishness few things are so humiliating that it would be a tragedy if he believed that you learn that when you are angry you have the right to be angry but that does not give you the right to be cruel you learn that just because someone doesn't love you the way you want to be loved it doesn't mean that the person doesn't know how to love and s he loves you as much as s he can because there are people who love you but simply don't know how to show it you learn that being forgiven is never enough sometimes you have to learn to forgive yourself you learn that with the same harshness that you judge you someday will be condemned you learn that no matter how many pieces your heart was broken into the world doesn't stop so you can fix it you learn that you cannot go back in time so you have to take care of your garden and not wait for someone to bring you flowers and you learn you can really bear it that you're really strong and that you can go farther than you think and that life has a value and you have a value before life and you learn that our doubts are disloyal and that makes us lose what we could achieve if it weren t for the fear of trying adaptation of veronica shoffstall's original text after a while  Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pitaten Social rule The Amber

is this poem worth publishing please analyze sunset because in every sunset awaits another death a peasant's soul gripped by fear first his family lost and in distress then his country down on one knee begging for his god to come through does he think he can conquer death or is it just a concept embedded deep within his mind as he awaits the onset of yet another sunset because in every sunset awaits another death the beauty of poetry is two fold layers of meaning and imagery as a reader i don't want you to tell me i want you to show me i want to feel it not just read it sunset death gripped by fear these are poetry cliches can you show me the fading glory of the sunset with your words can i feel the breath of the grim reaper on my neck as i read your poem i feel your poem is too straightforward i do not find a pattern or intentional non pattern in the rhythm or rhyme scheme that you chose your poem is my loyal dog sat next to me better poetry would be moist and rhythmic panting assured me of his constance i'd go back to the drawing board and really reach deeply into your arsenal of metaphors and paint a picture with them  Poetry Milton H.

read this passage poem what do you think when i wrote it originally it was in a passage of text but then i decided it could be a poem do you like it this way emotionless and numb i sit here idly leading a pointelss life for a pointless day can i somehow escape to another world where light frames every face and love kinders every heart that place so perfect so frightening i could not happily exist in a place where against the odds meat truth wisdom and honesty and though this place this place should be the place i strive to reach i wish not to see that until i am happy with a lonely obsolete existence never oops spell checker screwed up the spelling of meat not my fault lol holy twinkies i think i did it again that might have been me then not the spell checker i meant to write meant instead of meat lol hehe first of all its much harder to write free verse because a rhyme scheme gives you a framework to build your idea off of in free verse you have to win your reader over not with an easily wrapped up little package but a profoundly true deep statement your depth is there but the concrete connections to the ideals you are pursuing are not then again nobody agrees with me here and they think all that sing songy straight rhyme crap is fantastic a writing teacher once told me that adverbs were to be avoided that youre better off looking for a verb that is more specific i also think you misspelled kindels i really think the tension of your poem comes from the last lines which to me says kill thy darlings and start a new poem that tackles the much more difficult task of explaining why you must first find contentment here on earth and why the next best thing is really just a figment of our imagination overall one of the deepest poems i've read on answers  Poetry Bhagavad Gita Socrates Philo Religion Book of Mormon Amidah Translation House of Leaves The Dunciad Shaggy dog story English grammar Trinity Jacob Neusner Tao Te Ching Simone Weil Buddhism Deconstruction Biblical inerrancy Spell checker God Theory of conduct Mantra Meaning of life Paradise Lost Calvin and Hobbes A Course In Miracles John Berryman Didache Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friedrich Schleiermacher Emily Dickinson Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Leet Hey Jude Discordianism Sabbath Hangul Tetragrammaton Object-oriented programming Angel Rhyme Rudolf Hermann Lotze Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief African American Vernacular English Urantia The Amber Spyglass Philosophy of language Japanese grammar Apocrypha Church of Christ, Scientist Criticisms of Christianity Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity German grammar Goodness and value theory American Pie (song) George Oppen Sant Mat Eugene Onegin Past teachings of Prem Rawat Miguel de Cervantes Gary Snyder Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Sant Thakar Singh Mu'allaqat El (god) Extreme Programming Eastern Orthodox Church Rabindranath Tagore Origin belief Yehuda Halevi Book of Revelation American and British English differences W.I.T.C.H.

a poem comments or thoughts would be welcome i'm still planning to edit and the punctuation is probably off i just wrote this a few minutes ago pondering apology maybe i was the silly fool to try to make you stay my friend perhaps the best has been fulfilled though you don't care to make amends maybe i was always the one condescending proud and vain oh knowing i'm sorry or knowing i'm right doesn't always ease the pain thinking back on what has happened thinking of all the things i've revealed interrupting your slight remarks or unconciously ignoring your tiny appeals well here is my apology dear friend for everything i've ever done wrong i hope you never know this hurt and never have to sing this song though it's not this is based off something real i was really upset last night poetry sure helps relieve feelings doesn't it i've read a lot of poems but never one about apology that's pretty unique yes i agree that creativity is a great emotional outlet the poem needs a little polishing but all in all it does express your true feelings  Jon Secada God Emperor of Dune Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Shaggy dog story Nine Inch Nails Theory of conduct Blood on the Tracks Humphrey Bogart The Amber Spyglass Sharon Tate Pok__mon Live!

poem how is it these things make me remember you sometimes at the end of november when the wind catches the leaves and the dusk runs away at five i remember you when the air stirs with a stench and the wind hits my lungs brisk i remember you on occasion looking at the stones on the beach beneath my feet so far away from life i remember you i can't remember how you were but only how you are so subtle that thought like an unexpceted breeze or the darkness of room whose light has vanished when i write my poetry i quiver with that one impression i remember you i really love what you did dmc but the problem with editing is that once a work is edited it is no longer created by your own mind but is inflicted by the mind of another this doesn't just lend itself to love poetry to me it lends itself to the memory of a lost loved one of course every poem will be viewed by the history of the reader and i lost my mother months ago so this poem reminds me of her and sadness and missing her  Poetry Time Out of Mind Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Waka Second Battle of El Alamein C.

where do i find real poets open mics are ridiculous a bunch of people professing to be poets get up and read mulch verbal rhyming mulch that they might read fast to get an audience response if they make the audience laugh they are congratulated on their poetics i want to find a place to meet real poets who live and breathe poetry in all its beauty and ugliness i love hip hop and i am not trying to say that hip hop spoken word is bad but it is just that spoken word not poetry i couldn't agree more but unfortunately at an open mic you'll find maybe one in the whole crowd who is a real poet true poets are a rare thing indeed your best bet is to just not go to open mics anymore you could start your own group either locally or online of real poets you can pick and choose who gets to join good luck  Hip hop collaborations Hip hop culture Poetry Hip hop rivalries Poetry of the United States Hip hop music Nas (rapper) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism English literature Charles Bukowski John Berryman Performance poetry Rapping Gangsta rap Literature Alliterative verse Social rule Joke Ern Malley Novel Mu'allaqat Beastie Boys Pete Rock Walt Whitman Emily Dickinson OutKast Wu-Tang Clan affiliates Friends British Poetry Revival Imagism The Source (magazine) EastEnders Ghazal Gary Snyder Allen Ginsberg Betting (poker) Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1970-Present) Augustan poetry The Brady Bunch Leonard Cohen Swingout Pierre de Ronsard Sampling (music) Medieval French literature Beowulf Miguel de Cervantes Craps Pun Les contes d'Hoffmann English poetry Public Enemy Andy Kaufman Poker jargon Avenue Q Humour Piccolo Junior Saga Roots of hip hop music Aquemini Slam poetry Siegfried Sassoon Meter (poetry) Beat generation Rhyme Beavis and Butt-head Whose Line Is It Anyway?

i wanted to share something with you this is a peom i wrote i won several awards for it hope you like it i am not making an antiwar statement just a statement for us to win and them to lose is often times hard to choose if it was worth the lives it cost to suffer through the human loss to go to war and not come home when kids grow up all alone to lose a mother or a father kills the souls of son and daughter till the day theyv'e wept and cried remembering then one who died congrats on writing an award winning poem i'm not sure if you just wanted to share this with us or if you'd like comments regarding how to improve it it's a good poem the rhyme is pretty good and the feeling is that the words fit and are not forced there are however a few spots that show you either didn't post the exact version of what you entered in the contest or that you made a few typos or omissions when you posted it here for example they've not theyv'e you need a the in the last line to even out the beats and make the phrase flow more naturally the one who died i'd also have suggested until the day instead of till the day for the same reason beats regarding the concepts i'm not sure it's really all that difficult to choose between whether we want to win or lose i would never endorse i war i didn't want to win whether or not i did win is up to factors beyond my control but i'd certainly choose to win if i sound nit picky it's only because that's what any poem needs no matter how many awards it may have won if it can be improved you should try to improve it edward fitzgerald wrote the most widely read poem in the english language it's called the rubaiyat of omar khayyam and if you haven't read it you might want to put it on your reading list his first translation version has sold more copies than any other single english poem in history outside of the bible yet he edited and published at least other versions of it after he was successful because he thought he could make it better did he make it better it's a tough call because the original is the one most often cited yet there are those who would claim that each version was more accurate than the previous so edit if you want to improve even if it's already doing or has done well or not it's your poem and obviously your choice congrats again and keep writing  Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam Edward FitzGerald (poet) Poker jargon Determinism History of the English Bible Translation Omar Khayy__m E.

what do you think the music played with a calming frequency the speakers gently seeped the sound of ambient keyboards and light percussion creating a seductive soundtrack to our midnight drive through curtains of blackness the windows were cold to the touch reflecting the icy conditions in our immediate extremity salt stains and fingerprints littered the glass and streaks with melted snow cascaded down it's length the music pulsed louder yet gentle like the far away squeal of a pot of boiling water the skylight was glowing faintly with a vague hints of an impending dawn the car raced along a painfully straight stretch of road and she hadn't so much as turned the steering wheel two degrees in the last twenty minutes nor word was spoken as we were so perfect so happy they'll remember only our smiles 'cause that's all they've seen blood since dried when we are found are the tears in which we had drowned as we were so perfect so happy continued why are you doing this she spoke without expecting a response her voice penetrated the still air of our speechless drive so silent my heart had jumped i'm not doing anything i said but i didn't even believe that myself this is what's best for me for you for us or maybe just for me i thought as a tear formed in the pit of her eye the music poured through the speakers and we were losing ourselves in the cadence she looked down momentarily and closed her eyes for a bit longer than a standard blink then she was crying then she was shouting then i was shouting now pouring confessions having no answers or solutions we barely even heard the questions as we were so perfect so happy they'll remember only our smiles 'cause that's all they've seen blood since dried when we are found are the tears in which we had drowned as we were so perfect so happy don't put me underground i was meant for a life somewhere else please love give me the wheel before both of our hearts you will steal tonight will steal tonight as we were so perfect so happy don't remember only your smiles 'cause that's all they've seen blood since dried when we are found are the tears in which we had drowned as we were so perfect so happy our cracking voices became part of the music the car pressed on faster through the night as our voices lowered the cadence again overtook the air up ahead there was a curve approaching she made no indications of slowing source rise against the approaching curve i love rise against that song rocks d  Shaggy dog story Time Out of Mind Jon Secada The Amber Spyglass The Shining (film) Happy Tree Friends Sin City Poker jargon Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Indianapolis 500 Frankie Laine The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Speed of light The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Opportunity rover Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Beach Boys Paul Is Dead Hey Jude Futurama (TV series - season 5) Milton H.

this is another poem i wrote you folks do such a great job thought it would be interesting to get your take i make excuses thousands upon thousands i lost count years ago i excuse you even though there isn t one big enough to cover your sin or my bruises so what then start all over tomorrow lose count again hold you accountable yeah right as if there is a method to stop your need no determination to destroy whatever comes your way out of my mouth my mouth that used to want to engulf to praise everything about you and now just wants to spit you out and wash away the taste of salt and bitterness somehow i see you still what you ve tried to hide from me underneath the sarcasm the blood covered words i see your beauty this has not been changed since the day i sat down and scribbled it out i was in a hurry and angry obviously so don't tell me it's ranting i already know i also know how i'm planning to refine it my question is what would you do with it i love to see different styles best answer to whoever comes closest to what i have in mind or convinces me there's a better way i like the energy of the poem and the last five lines provide a nice turn by showing a different perspective without really shifting moods the two main refinements i think you can make would be to fine tune some of the language and to consider playing with line length for language some of what you have written can be compacted e g wash away the taste of salt and bitterness could simply be wash away the salt and bitterness without losing any meaning and some can be clarified e g to stop your need no determination to destroy whatever comes your way out of my mouth is a little confusing to me is he trying to destroy what you say or your ideas hopes love or something else also the line to engulf to praise is a bit much to put in one line not in a prudish sense but simply in trying to pack in both lust and verbiage in that same place these are examples but it's worth working through the whole poem to see what can be tightened or clarified as for line length i am not averse to skinny poems here though the energy seems a bit inhibited by the form as though the driving reason is simply a desire for short lines some lines contain discrete thoughts while other ideas spill over several lines with no real reason i can see for breaking where you do some of the passion you put into the poem gets choked off as a result i hope we get to see the revision this is a great first draft  Microeconomics Philosophy of language Shaggy dog story The Amber Spyglass Extreme Programming Photography David Hume Yoga Sutras of Patanjali The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Vampire Jean Grey Originalism Mathematics Haven (TNG episode) Epistemology Causality Euphemism Scientology beliefs and practices A Course In Miracles God Emperor of Dune The Smoking Room G__del's incompleteness theorem Korban Tenshinhan Simone Weil Deconstruction Origin belief Meaning of life Sinfest Theory of conduct Quantum mechanics Novel Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Summa Theologiae Milton H.

how literate are you in poetry in promotion of actual knowledge of established poetic tradition to counterbalance the overabundance of questions from would be poets seeking needy validation for their personal poems i'll give best answer status to the person who first answers all questions below satisfactorily i already know the answer to the first four so it's that's make or break as your subjective response make it cogent and articulate what are the three basic types or modes of poetry provide names and definitions name one elizabethan poet one romantic poet and one modernist poet what is prosody who is the current poet laureate for the us how is poetry relevant to you in a st century society obviously can have several answers just make sure you match the poet's name to the appropriate era thank you to those who gave such thorough responses even those with dissenting viewpoints my point in promoting this q a session is to promote a foray into the grand tradition of poetry which seems all too infrequent in the poetry yahoo answers section for those of you who suspect me of pedantry or pretentiousness i find myself slightly amused for two reasons first some of those same people seem to have no qualms establishing their own poetic credentials to assume a position of authority this leads me to my second point engaging poetry at a certain caliber does often require people esoteric knowledge poetry writers and readers alike should take the time to know the tradition from which the art form derives just because someone learns to play four or five chords on a guitar doesn't make him or her an accomplished musician sorry to say and as far as my particular q a session being the litmus test for who'd be a good reader or writer of poetry i never claimed nor would ever claim such a foolish thing i wanted to engage people with like minded background knowledge of the poetic tradition and maybe encourage those who weren't as familiar into a little research and as to my stance on free verse some seem to interpret my insistence on a knowledge of poetic tradition to be a condemnation of free verse untrue however free verse can be a very dangerous thing to a young poet who naively assumes it means writing whatever lines he or she wants well written free verse must follow its own internal structural demands or risk succumbing to prose writing with arbitrary line breaks and last but not least a confession i had thought that donald hall was still poet laureate not charles simic egads as socrates would indicate knowledge starts with admitting that one knows nothing what are the three basic types or modes of poetry provide names and definitions i may be off on this i m mostly self taught picking up most of my training from books my guess lyric dramatic and narrative or epic lyric poetry has song like musical qualities it tends to focus on emotions shakespeare s sonnets or dylan thomas with do not go gently into that good night would be examples of lyric poetry dramatic poetry would be verse written in a play shakespeare and jonson would both be examples of poets using this form narrative epic poetry came from oral tradition it tells what happened rather than what is felt milton s paradise lost for example name one elizabethan poet one romantic poet and one modernist poet elizabethan chistopher marlowe romantic william blake modernist wallace stevens what is prosody prosody is when you look at both meter and rhythm sonics in a poem i guess you could say it s the study of meter and rhythm some people use this as a substitute word for scansion though i don t i ve read long articles on prosody so i know my definition is very basic here who is the current poet laureate for the us charles simic how is poetry relevant to you in a st century society it is relevant to me in the same way it has been relevant to people living in other times poetry steps beyond the practical language of life and gives you a transcendent view of a subject it helps you not just record life but recognize what matters in life poetry and literature for that matter will have a hard time remaining relevant in a culture that is largely aliterate meaning that they can read but choose not to in general society has not trained its mind to read anything more complicated than a newspaper for me though poetry remains relevant for the reasons i discussed  History of literature Deconstruction Modernism Lyric poetry Irish poetry Anglo-Saxon literature Biblical poetry Restoration literature Haiku Translation Postmodernism Arabic literature Philosophy Tonality Socrates Blood on the Tracks Modernist poetry in English Walter J.

can you help me analyse this poem please analasye this poem eg the poetic technique style tone meaning etc thank you forty two years ago to me if to no one else the number is of some interest it was a brilliant starry night and the westward train was empty and had no corridors so darting from side to side i could catch the unwonted sight of those almost intolerably bright holes punched in the sky which excited me partly because of their latin names and partly because i had read in the textbooks how very far off they were it seemed their light had left them some at least long years before i was and this remembering now i mark that what light was leaving some of them at least then forty two years ago will never arrive in time for me to catch it which light when it does get here may find that there is not anyone left alive to run from side to side in a late night train admiring it and adding noughts in vain the tone in the first stanza is reminiscent in the second reflective contemplating the rhyme scheme is rather loose giving the poem a contemporary feel and perhaps giving us the rhythm of the train or of the speaker's thoughts in the first stanza the speaker observes that the stars are beautiful because of their appearance and their mystery also notably commenting on the fact that light takes a long time to travel from the stars to us on earth the parenthetical in the first two lines also creates an aura of solitude and of intimacy with nature in the second stanza we are told that some of the light probably meaning some stars are farther away than others still has not reached the speaker and that furthermore there may not be time for the light to reach the speaker ever will never arrive for me to catch it this could mean that the speaker is dying and this notion of death is possibly confirmed with when it light does get here may find that there is not anyone left alive the last line admiring it and adding thoughts in vain suggests that perhaps the speaker acknowledges that he or she is entertained by the idea that only he or she can enjoy the beauty of the stars after all there is no one else on the train the westward train was empty and in the end there is not anyone left alive lastly the speaker's identity is only adorned with the line there latin names and partly because i had read in the textbooks meaning that he or she is probably a young student probably at a university though possibly at a high school  Poetry John Berryman Novel Italian literature Black hole Meter (poetry) Christopher Columbus Das Lied von der Erde Miguel de Cervantes Non-native pronunciations of English Socrates Rhyme Proven__al literature The Raven Augustan poetry Rudolf Steiner G-Man (Half-Life) Gamma ray burst Beowulf Extraterrestrial hypothesis Piccolo Junior Saga Opportunity rover Eugene Onegin Four Quartets Samuel Wesley (poet) Ginny Weasley William Shakespeare D.

poem up for review mist the delicate haze looks like it could be twisted like a sheer skirt if there were fingers ghostly enough instincts fragile enough to not abuse their stays in the very space that they take up to not go right through the fog like a pure shriek stabbing through a soft purr is that what could happen if there were oh sinewy fairies i beg you shape my fingers please and the twirling rings of mist will rest around the fingers from which they were created ah how the quiet interrupted power not of moving something huge but something light is underrated well of course there are bad poems i know you were trying to be nice but i don't need to hear someone say they like my poem if they also say they have no standards whatsoever that is meaningless well i do have consistency in my poems they're just hard to understand thanks for reviewing though thanks bodacious sorry what does heavy handed mean this is the second poem i have critiqued tonight so here goes and just remember anything i suggest is just constructive criticism let me start off by saying you have an excellent sense of words but you do something i did as a young poet and a lot of young poets do i mean you can put some great sounding lines together and everything seems to make sense until you stand back and look at the entire poem there really isn't any idea or theme carried throughout the poem so when you're done reading it and someone asks what the poem was about all you can say is i don't know but it sounded good the real challenge for me was to be clear and direct in the message i am trying to get across in my poems and describe things and make it sound good now if you are just writing for yourself or boyfriend or whatever you can forget about what i just said and write just however you want please keep writing you are on the right track  Blood on the Tracks Poetry Theory of conduct The Shining (film) Time Out of Mind Heavy metal music Social rule Emily Dickinson Hiberno-English Storytelling Milton H.

'i am from' poem my teacher is making us write a poem about us i usually good at writing poetry just not when its about myself so i was wondering if anyone could help if they had any examples or just something that might spark some inspiration basicly it just has to be about people places phrases traditions smells sounds tastes food sights activities and or clothing trends wow this is wide open i'm not sure why you've got writer's block unless it's because it's so wide open well you can always write a poem about how people should not judge you by the way you look the food you eat the clothes you wear or your screen name in this poem you can cite all or some of the above and show why it doesn't really tell anyone anything real about yourself then go on to tell them how you really are hope this helps  Japanese tea ceremony Poetry "Weird Al" Yankovic Waka Japanese poetry English poetry Irish poetry Beat generation Surrealist techniques Social aspects of clothing Tofu Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Epic poetry Shit Pseudoscience Grunge music Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism British Poetry Revival Kitchen English literature Fecal incontinence Synaesthesia William Blake Clothing Aesthetic Realism Marina Tsvetaeva Modernist poetry in English Biblical inerrancy Journey Into Imagination The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Thomas M.

can anyone help me find this poem i've been sent this poem by e mail a couple of times over the past several years but didn't keep it it was written by an old woman and found after her death if i'm remembering correctly a nurse from the nursing home she lived in found it and it had a running theme of when you look at me what do you see and then things like do you see the child i once was or something like that and other musings on her life i know this isn't much but i am hoping that someone else has also seen it or can find it for me i don't know where to even start to look for it it is a very moving poem and i can't believe i didn't save it when i first read it is it this one click the link below what do you see nurses what do you see what are you thinking when you're looking at me a crabby old woman not very wise uncertain of habit with faraway eyes who dribbles her food and makes no reply when you say in a loud voice i do wish you'd try who seems not to notice the things that you do and forever is losing a stocking or shoe who resisting or not lets you do as you will with bathing and feeding the long day to fill is that what you're thinking is that what you see then open your eyes nurse you're not looking at me i'll tell who i am as i sit here so still as i do at your bidding as i eat at your will i'm a small child of ten with a father and mother brothers and sisters who love one another a young girl of sixteen with wings on her feet dreaming that soon now a lover she'll meet a bride soon at twenty my heart gives a leap remembering the vows that i promised to keep at twenty five now i have young of my own who need me to guide and a secure happy home a woman of thirty my young now grown fast bound to each other with ties that should last at forty my young sons have grown and are gone but my man's beside me to see i don't mourn at fifty once more babies play around my knee again we know children my loved one and me dark days are upon me my husband is dead i look at the future i shudder with dread for my young are all rearing young of their own and i think of the years and the love that i've known i'm now an old woman and nature is cruel 'tis jest to make old age look like the fool the body it crumbles grace and vigor depart there is now a stone where i once had a heart but inside this old carcass a young girl still dwells and now and again my battered heart swells i remember the joys i remember the pain and i'm loving and living life over again i think of the years all too few gone too fast and accept the stark fact that nothing can last so open your eyes nurses open and see not a crabby old woman look closer see me  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Shaggy dog story Jon Secada Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Amber Spyglass Knots Landing Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Milton H.

untitled poem that i'd like comments on feels like just yesterday when you were so small i held you against my chest thinking everything was going to be alright but being so far away it's hard to believe how much you've grown but your life is crashing down before your weak eyes the one who granted you life is close by but she's not listening it's like she doesn't even care she ruined her life so why does she have to ruin yours putting you through those nightmares isn't something she should have done you've seen the terrors fo men you've felt the ache of mothers and you aren't even old enough to understand why your life is tumbling down but she got what she deserves you're safe from her hurt don't cry little one my arms are still spread wide to protect you from the world hush now little one everything is going to be alright you're going to be alright this poem is dedicated to my baby cousin it's good deep it's hard to comment on poetry because it's so emotional there are just a few technical errors like fo instead of of and isn't something she should have done dosen't make sense the only thing i don't like about it is your weak eyes but it's good overall  Jon Secada Theory of conduct Skin of Evil (TNG episode) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Time Out of Mind Piccolo Junior Saga Social rule Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Yoko Ono Diving Kender Cindy Sheehan Aesthetic Realism Coming of Age (TNG episode) K' Procrastination E.

critique this poem be merciless you where does it all go dig into skin with stray cat claws dog howls at night to harmonica songs candles burn low all out of matches stare at the sputtering wick as it flashes more than a day without sleep and tired to the bones but my mind s caught a streak putting off my drink to empty out my head getting just a bit closer to the tracks i claim i tread but trying is a bitch trying takes time dedication regularity and best of all conviction though it pleases just the same to talk and dream and so i tend to do instead educated and fairly well read and lazy or uninspired heart sedated by a faint desire more ego than i like to admit half a clich still half a clich plain to see what ties me down the most is me just fix it boy it s not so hard sober up and get serious focus i am only energy in motion a white astral aura the bearded man keeper of souls and enlightenment has not called on me i have not shown the proper respect because my spirit is equally as old and in this life i can see only my half of the power and possibility ever undulating through time vilcabamba ecuador copyrights reserved by poster i could go back and look for things to adjust but honestly it was a nice smooth read normally i get nervous at one word line breaks not saying i don't do it myself but everything flowed it had a real bluesy tone to it it would work really well in a spoken word format nice specific detail and good clear voice how about i promise to be merciless on your next poem  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sinfest Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Diablo II: Lord of Destruction W.I.T.C.H.

a new poem a little different any thoughts i'm using the expression better angel differently than how it's probably usually used i found out what it means after i wrote the poem hopefully the poem will show itself how i meant the expression to be used any comments or thoughts would be nice thanks one more thing i wrote this last night and have been editing but i'm not sure on the puctuation just bear with me not your better angel you of all should know of me there is a sin burried deep in shadow darker than the night no stranger to my thoughts but stranger to the light the sin itself matters not but every day has in evil fought against my god though his gracious son already says that he has won and you are blind to all my wrong you have called me all along my better angel though it seems strange you have never seen my soul's dark face oh to think perhaps you have but never shunned and never laoughed instead in silence loved me still oh tolerant heart and loving will but another speculation comes into my head with pounding drums perhaps you hide a deeper shame and so have given me the name your better angel heaven above alas my heart's is no true love mine is not the power to judge a soul well though i think you are my better angel i had a couple mis spellings in here sorry i'm not sure if i should leave it at this or work harder on editing what do you think i understand what you meant its a great poem you should be very proud of this was great makes you look at your life and how you life it and it makes you want to be a better person its great you did a wonderful job keep up the good work take care  Jon Secada Sola fide Hell Justification (theology) Angel Devil The Amber Spyglass Summa Theologiae Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Socrates Israel ben Eliezer Fallen angel Evil Meaning of life Conan the Barbarian A Course In Miracles Qiyamah Paradise Lost John the Baptist Duties of the Heart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Time Out of Mind Book of Isaiah Eastern Orthodox Church Nora Roberts Church of Christ, Scientist Soul Original sin Confucius Ludwig Wittgenstein Sinfest Religion Repentance AVN Awards George Fox The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Theodicy Elemental spirits (Seiken Densetsu) C.

comments on this poem please growth i'm old enough now no need to rub rose petals on the truth anymore i smelled the reality of this cluttered with forgotten poems carved walls spirits and loss my lonely home sits awake and waiting for me i really like this linz i think i see why some think it is disjointed but to me the notion of growing to the point of being able to return home and as i read it revisit your past is a powerful one it also looks like you took great care in writing this it feels precise and succinct with that in mind i am reading smelled as being intentionally past i e coming even when rubbing in the rose petals i went back and forth on whether it should be smell but i think it does more as you have it i would consider playing with spirits and loss to work one more concrete image in there but it certainly works as is well done  Simone Weil W.I.T.C.H.

help me edit i tend to write without even thinking then go back and move lines around ect i'm kind of stuck on this one at the moment it's ironic because it's about not caring about other peoples opinions and yet here i am wanting yours again poetry what is mine is not yours once i have filled the page not a thing you can do with your ink will change it commas and hyphens run ons and periods less than perfect grammar the few errors in prose these scars define only the face of my poetry the outward appearance some call it ugly i call it character ok my thoughts i don't like the second part it just doesn't sit well also thought i would change character to beautiful then changed my mind again thoughts and opinions please some call it ugly i call it true stay away from clear cut dichotomies like cold hot fast slow etc to me since you are trying to minimize the importance of form grammar and standard modes of presentation in poetry i don't see why you've chosen four line stanzas the slant rhyme and meter are your best asset so far so i would concentrate on making it a sound poem you have also slimmed your audience down to the people who understand grammar and typical poetic conundrums and of the people who can appreciate poetry thats not so large a portion as we would like to believe ultimately instead of approaching this idea from what is mine is not yours but you have failed to answer what is yours i dont get hung up on grammar or capitalization either so if thats how you roll what are you about that is what i think is missing from your poem and what will fill out your dialectic you have your antithesis and you already have your synthesis though it is rather abrupt so the hard part is already done technical crap restating the face of your poetry as outward appearance is cliche and degrades the interesting image of a poem having a face i would further describe your face as opposed to restating your metaphor the first two stanzas are strong except the line not a thing you can do which is vague change your vocabulary get more specific and you can sell this keep on rocking in the free world babe  Poetry Literature Meter (poetry) Alliterative verse Screenwriting Noam Chomsky John Berryman English grammar Translation Biblical poetry Theory of conduct Poetic diction English language Philosophy of language Dialectic Urdu Perl Song The nature of God in Western theology Tamil language Anglo-Saxon literature Imagism Aesthetic Realism Microeconomics Socrates Extreme Programming Sant Mat Finnish language Italian literature Chinese language Novel English literature Deconstruction H.D.

a poem i found desert sun in the desert there is little life to be found only death of dying plants can be seen on the ground little water too much thirst the only thing here is the burning sands and the relentless sun autumn summer winter fall it does not matter for eventually the desert heat will consume life and all yet there is hope in this arid waste land once a month every year clouds form darken and rain they soon will bear soon drift and come near then in a violent sudden and flooding bursts all the rain comes down and cools the air life and beauty then grows and flourishes desert flowers bloom in colors and forms i have never seen and bird's who perch in cactuses their songs fill the air their songs i have heard here never else where yet this is only for a month eventually under the relentless sun the heat will become too much to bear desert flowers and their color wither and the desert birds and their songs disappear as they fly else where then the landscape of desolation a graveyard for what used to briefly hold life re appears so remember this lesson of the desert son life's existence is brief and death is forever and always near enjoy whatever days you may have left for death may take away your life and everything else you hold dear just like the desert sun cool  Desert Climate of the United Kingdom Carnivorous plant Water Severe weather terminology (United States) Renewable energy Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Bird migration Second Battle of El Alamein Geography of Chile Season The Amber Spyglass K__ppen climate classification Environmental concerns with electricity generation Kain (Legacy of Kain) Permian-Triassic extinction event Sunlight Wind power Thunderstorm Death Valley National Park Palmdale, California Cactus Rose Ozone depletion Desertification Monsoon Thomas Cole Geography of India Fog Prosopis cineraria Zion National Park Stellar evolution Hippeastrum Ozone hole Pysanka Solar power John McDouall Stuart Las Vegas, Nevada Jute Climate of India John Forrest, 1st Baron Forrest of Bunbury Lake Precipitation (meteorology) Trinity test The Time Machine Ecology Matsuo Bash__ Hydrogen Thermoregulation Energy development Flower Mojave Desert Phoenix, Arizona Geography of Africa Kigo Goblin Valley State Park Cloud Houseplant Thar Desert Nuclear fallout Atlanta metropolitan area Arable land Autonomous building Episodes of Lost (Season 1) A-ha Geology of the British Isles Emu Maya mythology Kalahari Desert Weather lore Opportunity rover National Weather Service Gliding Water vapor Geography of Afghanistan Leaf Hyperthermia Las Vegas metropolitan area Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Acorn Water (molecule) Geography of Pakistan Explosive material Salt Lake County, Utah Peach Climate of the Alps Paragliding 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Future energy development Book of Isaiah Arizona Lightning Utah Venus Flytrap Salton Sea Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tribulation Autumn

so i finally got the guts to post one of my poems online feedback please i'd write my age but i don't want people to give me nicer comments just because they think i'm young i also wouldn't mind if someone thought of a name for it because i'm drawing a blank i stand alone here above crashing waves of grey on the brink of a pier my mind gone astray everything is black there's no moon tonight fear is something i lack i'm too blunt for fright my life is now spent yet i feel naught but elation at last i'm content despite my situation louder my heart pumped adrenaline coursing through my veins and so i jumped awaiting the pain but it never did come as i plummeted into the waves i was instantly numb now only death i craved my chest began to flare for how long i struggled i wonder inhaling my final breath of air the waves pulled me under my lungs flooded with water the worst feeling i've ever had an aquatic slaughter yet death was not so bad so where is the light that resides at tunnel's end i see only a black plight an abyss in which i descend i want only to be numb again but pain never harks so i do the one thing i can succumb to the dark this is one of my first poems so i understand if it s not that great i just want honest opinions and just to clear this up i am not suicidal emo gothic or anything of the sort great feedback breeze i didn't even notice gr ful one i assumed that it would be human instincts to struggle whether you wanted to or not i can see how that would be confusing though thanks for your opinion hello infernal waves for one of your first poems i think this has some pretty good potential possible title undertow don't feel the need to rhyme sometimes the rhymes will come across sing song and distract from your message personal experience here i think this might read better as free verse if you'd like i could show you a free verse edit version of your poem as an example of what it could look like just add details if you want to see that otherwise you may want to try a version yourself i think it would be stronger you have good instincts you give images and specific details they could be strengthened but i like where you're going with this so nice job if you work at it you'll continue to get better take care  Theory of conduct Time Out of Mind Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Wall Yoga Sutras of Patanjali The Amber Spyglass Scientology beliefs and practices Panic attack The Dark is Rising Sequence Milton H.

how do people get published who do you send them to and how do you protect your work todd the previous commentator made some very good points on one point i might take a different tack i never use poet's market or writer's market i have found them to be slick corporate unimaginative and a whole buncha other stuff as well what i do use is an incredible source book that comes out every two years from dustbooks called the international directory of little magazines and small presses it lists literally thousands of publishers along with reporting times the magazines slant who they have published in the past what they pay etc this can be a bit daunting to go through so i look at it as a long term research program i put stars by each one i think i might fit in to and at the same time consume the magazine poets writers the bible for literary writers if you haven't seen it their classified section is legendary they have listings for poems and short stories wanted for anthologies literary magazines and many other things if you are wanting to start publishing the best way to go is to start with magazines no book publisher will put up for someone who does not have a track record so if after a couple of years you go to a publisher and say something like look i've had poems published in ploughshares the paris review crazyhorse i have an audience who will pay you money to buy a book etc best of luck  Literature Guy Davenport Manga Harold Bloom Comic book Doctor Who spin-offs James Joyce Marvel Comics King James Version of the Bible Science fiction Samuel Beckett Science fiction magazine Anglo-Saxon literature J__rriais The Standard Charles Bukowski Objectivist poets Michael J.

what do you think of this poem night when moonlight glides over the surface of the lake fireflies wander happily in their first wake lights shimmer blinking on and off a whispering breeze flutters over the silent meadow a little star cries lost and misplaced it falls down onto the grass where it slowly fades away the moon gives it's light for a silent rabbit that's finding it's way home it rushes into cuddly arms far away in a little cottage a mother quietly sings a lullaby to her baby the summer air is crisp and clear with the smells of life i think there are some good images here but if you'd like to make it better it will need some work you seem more comfortable at least more able to communicate your vision when you're writing in free verse rather than rhyme so you should probably stick to free or open verse with this one your first two stanzas have lines that seem transposed you have fireflies gliding over their wake and a breeze that flutters over a meadow you might want to try having the breeze whisper over the lake and the fireflies futter over the meadow it might look like this when moonlight glides on the surface of the lake a whispering breeze creates a wandering wake lights shimmer blinking on and off fireflies flutter happily over a silent meadow the over in the second line was changed so the over in the original th line wasn't a repeat plus moonlight would be on the lake not over you can't see it when it doesn't touch the lake the breeze and shimmering lights were moved up into the same stanza as the lake and wander moved up as well to make an alliteration with wake hopefully softening the rhyme in the first stanza since it wasn't found anywhere else in your poem in your third stanza little star is this a metaphor for the firefly if so can you hear the cry of a firefly be careful when you create your images so that you don't make them too fanciful your poem is well grounded in natural images if you create a fantasy you'll lose touch with the reality it creates in the fourth stanza you say the moon gives its light i wouldn't do that you already said the moonlight was on the lake so i'd find another way to say that maybe the pale silver light shows a stealthy rabbit the secret way home this avoids using silent and moonlight again plus it tells us that the rabbit understands there are predators and must be careful choosing a way home only it knows and is illuminated in the light of the moon finally summer air is seldom crisp and if they are by the lake it's probably sultry which also just happens to merge better with life like the summer air is sultry but clear alive with the smells of life just some suggestions your images were okay but some editing and you'll have even better ones keep writing i like what your mind sees  Alliterative verse Poetry Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Discworld gods John Berryman Parsifal Meter (poetry) Song Paul Revere's Ride USS Tunny (SS-282) Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Shaggy dog story Phoebe Buffay's songs Jon Secada Infidels Beowulf Four Quartets Moon The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe W.I.T.C.H.

a different voice than i've ever used before less poetic and maybe more real but i'm not sure how it holds up as a poem read it as a conversation except for the chorus the first line is the speaker and every other line is the other voice the small children without exception get up early every day why i don t know but it is either inspiring or annoying depending on what i m not sure my internal balance i suppose what do you really mean i really mean that i want that kind of unwavering enthusiasm for life yes and love and challenge i know i m growing out of adolescent habits what habits it's laborious for me to sleep to the high heat of late morning and that means what it means children can t sleep for excitement adults for worry you re worried yes college loans love bad jobs good jobs money ah the same thing they get up to greet i try to sleep in to avoid life some form of it i guess here s the story my mother is always sad my father has four chronic diseases my sisters hate my father my mother should but instead she prays for him i m confused and i feel like my beginning is hailed with an end are you through with your greek chorus now chorus i am alone fine then your greek solo and no one is ever really alone what the hell does that mean no no i ask the questions you answer that is how this poem works fine so as i was saying what were you saying the little kids and siblings yes my dear little brother and sister don t be sentimental they seem to understand life they seem sage sage stoic almost like marcus aurelius embracing calamity without bowing to it don t be pretentious either sorry my coping mechanism is intellectualization you give yourself too much credit o k the point is despite the erosion of everything we know erosion eh despite the dismantling of the household yeah despite the kitchen clock disappearing along with other things that have belonged to this family yes this family for years the duration of my life ah the eldest yes despite the divorce now she s getting real the clashing of two realities no three his hers ours yes yes they get up happily early every morning and watch cartoons as if this is just life as if this too shall pass yes but how can they know how can they trust it will because they know it must so the line breaks in this are really not what they are supposed to be this might just be a disasterous jumble of sentences that won't make sense the way they are now if so i'm sorry willow you have questioned if your piece holds as a poem i'm no litteraly expert so i should also question if my reply holds as a critique but i know for sure that you long to break from the dogma of form and that you are seeking to find your own voice a voice that unveils your soul and denudes your true colors i believe that as much as you maintain the honesty of that voice the rest would be but edge trimming once again i'm deeply moved before i elaborate i wanna point you to a simple trick that could help boosting the meanings of your genius lines which is simply the line breakings dont hesitate to press enter in every meaning you want to emphasis and be greedy every meaning counts allow the reader to stop at every image i will demonstrate shortly dont you believe that a poetic dialogue needs two poets in a discourse it's not clear why the poem was posted in posts but it's clear that each was written in a seperate sitting which is revealed in the different attitude of the chorus and the different dramatic consistency of every part the other voice in the first part is agressive and distractive however let me try to use the line break to cut the flatness of the other voice the small children without exception get up early every day why i don t know but it is either inspiring or annoying it depends it flows better than depending on what i m not sure my internal balance i suppose what do you really mean i really mean that i want that kind of unwavering enthusiasm for life yes and love and challenge i know i m growing out of adolescent habits what habits it's laborious for me to sleep to the high heat of late morning and that means what it means children can t sleep for excitement adults for worry you re worried yes college loans love bad jobs good jobs money ah the same thing they get up to greet i try to sleep in to avoid life some form of it i guess the second part is brilliant it is also the most dramatic the lines flow so easily the chorus this time adds an enriching dimension and poses serious and important questions investigating remarks all of which will be more revealed through more of that enter pressings the third part carries deep thoughts and conclusive philosophic statements but the chorus is back to its blunt distractive tone which deprive you from the symbolic benefit of you managing to turn that voice from an opposing investigative voice to one who sympathize empathize with your explained agony keep it up willow  Socrates EastEnders

a slightly long poem i made tell me what you think of it rainbows of life by valeria van hoven life is like a rainbow with beginning and end lined beautiful colors like humans they depend we are those colors representing our souls with our own different shades our own different goals red is the aggressive ill tempered tinge throwing tantrums as it lives frozen in cringe stereotypically so but deep down inside lives a fiery love no other can provide and then there s yellow so warm and bright but commonly missed as it s pale and light still yellow tries hard to stand out of the crowd shining so gracefully in rainbows so proud blue is the calmest the coolest of the lot passively gleaming not a color it fought boring dull or depressing it may seem blue brightens the days with its powerful beam silver platter purple the royal tint born ignorant and rich with an arrogant glint tries hard to grasp image of what is real the heart of the purple is the most ideal next is the green whose humble sense shows the neutral the normal it sticks to the prose limited to laws the green is not daring its nature s to nurture as it s loving and caring last is the orange the ecstatic and wild playful and funny much like a little child boisterous brave and at times quite mean true orange is gentle smart and keen united we form this emblazoned wonder through the good bad achievement and blunder a single shade stands for the color of your heart which was packaged in you from the very start colors arching for a moment they last before they disappear into the past just as we live we play and love life is as quick as that rainbow above although the illusion left without adieu born are new lives a rainbow anew orange yellow purple green red and blue one of these six colors lives inside of you hi i'm valeria and i'm fifteen i submitted this poem yesterday but i want more opinions about it i slightly edited it as well tell me what you think if you don't like it don't be afraid to tell me so help me improve it hello valeria this is an interesting idea for a poem i will place some comments under each stanza life is like a rainbow with beginning and end lined beautiful colors like humans they depend we are those colors representing our souls with our own different shades our own different goals i don t understand like humans they depend i m not making the connection here i think once you get to line and it s more clear but line isn t working for me red is the aggressive ill tempered tinge throwing tantrums as it lives frozen in cringe stereotypically so but deep down inside lives a fiery love no other can provide line here is good however frozen in cringe is awkward and needs to be rethought and then there s yellow so warm and bright but commonly missed as it s pale and light still yellow tries hard to stand out of the crowd shining so gracefully in rainbows so proud i would keep your parallel structure in line one and add a so before bright blue is the calmest the coolest of the lot passively gleaming not a color it fought boring dull or depressing it may seem blue brightens the days with its powerful beam this is all right in general you may want to deepen the ideas behind each of the colors and get below the surface a bit more i think you accomplish that the most with red so far that can be a future rewrite though silver platter purple the royal tint born ignorant and rich with an arrogant glint tries hard to grasp image of what is real the heart of the purple is the most ideal i don t like the words image of in line maybe replace them with at this is a more solid stanza like your red one next is the green whose humble sense shows the neutral the normal it sticks to the prose limited to laws the green is not daring its nature s to nurture as it s loving and caring it sticks to the prose is just there for the rhyme rethink this maybe limited by laws in line it isn t really laws though it s societal constraints give it some thought line is a little clunky too many words here pare it down some for the rhythm last is the orange the ecstatic and wild playful and funny much like a little child boisterous brave and at times quite mean true orange is gentle smart and keen line you may want to remove little here it feels a bit awkward in your rhyme using mean in line makes line a bit confusing you may want to give that some thought this is also one of your stronger stanzas due to the detail united we form this emblazoned wonder through the good bad achievement and blunder a single shade stands for the color of your heart which was packaged in you from the very start not bad i like emblazoned wonder line needs a little smoothing out colors arching for a moment they last before they disappear into the past just as we live we play and love life is as quick as that rainbow above maybe fleeting is a better word here than quick in line beyond that this is probably your strongest stanza in the poem although the illusion left without adieu born are new lives a rainbow anew orange yellow purple green red and blue one of these six colors lives inside of you second half of this is good you need to think about rewording the first two lines here i hope some of these comments helped like i said cool idea with a few rewrites it could be really interesting keep writing and take care  Color Care Bears Diamond Dragon Booster

when writing metrical poetry how do you begin writing your poetry with free verse it was easier to just get the words on page but i'm going free metrical poetry only for awhile but it's made it harder for me to get my thoughts down the way i want them to right now i'm expirimenting just writing the poem in free verse and then converting it into a set form in which ways do you have the most success thanks for any thoughts ideas i'm new to metrical poetry too most of what i've written is free verse i've had the exact same experience you've had and arrived at the same solution if i start with metrical poetry i feel like i'm stunting my content so i write it in free verse and then consider which traditional form would make the most sense to try to convert it to i rewrite it in that form using the free verse content as a guide and then i review both results so i think you're on the right track  Poetry Meter (poetry) Haiku Literature Alliterative verse Japanese poetry Poetry of the United States Biblical poetry Prose Irish poetry Imagism Einstein's field equation Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Old Norse poetry Waka George Oppen Blank verse Arabic poetry Mu'allaqat French literature of the 19th century Sonnet Robert Creeley William Butler Yeats Blood on the Tracks General relativity Limerick (poetry) Real number Medieval French literature Korean literature Homer English poetry Thomas M.

knight errant what do you think my dreams grow darker as the night continues on its journey towards dawn i hear the approaching thunder of my knight in shining armor his quest it seems is as much a mystery to him as it is to me i always believed he d come to take me to the world of ever after but as my lonely days wander into years his image grows dim in my magic mirror my heroic knight has become lost in the forest of my nightmares does he hear me call does he know it s my voice he hears or does he think his own madness mocks his failure to find what he seeks as the dark moon sinks slowly below the horizon i sit helpless in my empty room no tower no rapunzel long hair to guide a prince to me only dismal reality for company i turn my silent mirror face down and stare out the window watching for the dawn which unlike my knight is sure to come i saw a starfall made a wish the one that helps me to survive sometimes i want her be my friend but now i need her be my wife  Rapunzel The Shining (film) Link (Legend of Zelda) Parsifal Waking the Dragons Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Blood (computer game) Final Fantasy IX Night (book) The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Arthas Menethil Characters of The Sandman Knight Rider Quest for Glory Siegfried Schtauffen W.I.T.C.H.

opinions on this please her pain was tangible snapping like electricity in the air the taste of it lay on her tongue with every breath it polluted her soul gave her cause to cry in anguish in the darkness the terrible darkness loneliness played games with her like an evil trickster it promised laughter then delivered pain she called out she cries out still begging for mercy for someone to save her but everyone that comes eventually goes leaving in their wake the laugher of the devils the ones that plague her the ones that blacken her days that the steal the light from where will her release come who will set her free will the dark own her forever will the devils play their games for eternity who will set her free till then the darkness reigns it suffers no light extinguishing it with fury so it will never be again till then the darkness reigns loneliness her king the poem is about a women longing for luv but in all forms she feels alone and lost unworthy of love and believes that she will forever be trapped this has a good amount of potential it talks about pain and loneliness but is not monumentally boring that can sound a little harsh but without images to grasp onto poems of this type can quickly devolve into abstract messes yours is above that and looks like it could get even better you asked for opinions so here's mine work a little more to engage the senses in this poem you are dealing with pain and loneliness your reader needs to be able to latch on to what does that look like feel like smell like etc so when you start with pain don't tell me it's tangible show me in what ways it's tangible so your first lines might be her pain snapping like electricity in the air ok then you hit line the taste of it lay on her tongue what does pain taste like i have no idea but it is not a word to clarify that to your readers if it has a taste what is it i was reading a question in another section describing a bad labor pains in pregnancy the mother got to tallking about the actually delivery and said it was like trying to push out a bowling ball covered in shards of glass now as a guy i will never experience labor but that description will stay with me it made what would be an abstract pain to me something that i could relate to this is what you need to add to make this poem stronger i think it is good in some parts but it could be very good these kinds of changes will make that difference just give it some thought take care  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hell The Amber Spyglass Theory of conduct Scientology beliefs and practices Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Emancipation of Mimi Simone Weil The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Paradise Lost Shen Gong Wu Sin City Demon Breastfeeding Jon Secada Time Out of Mind Wolfrider Summa Theologiae Atomism Immortality Childbirth Characters in the Smurfs Thief (computer game) Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Kodocha The Dunciad Baseball Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Conan the Barbarian Evil InuYasha media and release information Sense Night (book) Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Tag W.I.T.C.H.

any comments on my poem happy cockroaches cockroaches can run away from anything including from the lights being turned on from cleaning up after themselves from their multiplying offspring from people pets and sprays from being thankful for food and shelter and from paying a cent for rent c i'm not sure if you meant to do it but your poem seems to move from being about the actual insects to a person who can be seen as a cockroach if that's what you were going for you do it in a subtle way and it works very well cent for rent is a nice way to end the poem as there is no rhyming before this i like it it has a certain shel silverstein meets an irish limerick feel to it keep writing  Shel Silverstein Cockroach Rent (musical) Poetry Andrew Dice Clay Limerick Limerick (poetry) Rudyard Kipling Literature Gross domestic product Foodborne illness U2 (band) Totally Spies!

what do you think of my poem a little girl splashes in a puddle fresh from an afternoon shower her mother watches from the window and thinks about how innocent and beautiful it is if only life was like that for the world she thought if only the world could see what i see the curtain falls she opens the door honey come inside she calls and realizes such is life so innocently the little girl skips inside blissfully unaware of the world around her theres two more parts but they're not gonna fit so i'll just put them in the additional details all comments are appreciated note that this is my first serious poem kind of more like a story idk and sort of a work in progress thank you for reading and giving constructive criticism she doesn't know that the man next door is slowly painfully dying she doesn't know that the boy down the street is sick with cancer and may not get better she doesn't understand what it means to be sick to be hungry or poor how blissfully unaware she is of the terrible things in the world she also hasn't lived or loved hasn't felt exhilarating happiness she doesn't understand that with love comes pain she knows not of the sheer joy that comes with life however nor she know the pain for now she skips thru life so blissfully unaware of the ups and downs joys and sorrows the events that make up life again just let me know what you think comments like it sucks or cool are kinda worthless to be honest so please just leave a bit of constructive criticism or a positive comment like it has a good message or something thank you very much i think that this poem is pretty good i actually like it but there are some things that i think need to be changed and thinks about how innocent and beautiful it is if only life was like that for the world she thought if only the world could see what i see i don't want you to tell me what she thinks with the child you're giving me a beautiful image of innocence i want you to create an image for me of the mother also not just tell me what she thinks perhaps you could describe the conditions of her life anything to give me a feel for the contrast between the two so innocently the little girl skips inside leave out the so innocently part we're bright enough to get the image you're trying to convey don't pound it home just draw the picture we'll figure it out also leave out the she doesn't know that i would also leave out the word painfully and the may not get better when you said the man was dying we already have a picture in our minds same with the boy with cancer too much information she doesn't understand what it means to be sick to be hungry or poor how blissfully unaware she is of the terrible things in the world i don't really like these lines either again you're telling us instead of drawing us a picture perhaps mom is coughing or shooting up or getting yelled at by the landlord or cursed at by a neighbor draw me a picture of the child being blissfully unaware don't just tell me that she's blissfully unaware she also hasn't lived or loved hasn't felt exhilarating happiness she doesn't understand that with love comes pain she knows not of the sheer joy that comes with life however nor she know the pain for now she skips thru life so blissfully unaware of the ups and downs joys and sorrows the events that make up life i like what you're trying to do here i'm just not real keen on how you're doing it i would probably step away from the picture that you've drawn up to this point and just make it a commentary on life and innocence don't refer to she just refer to life with life comes growth and pain and disappointment there is something to be said for innocence but there is also something to be said for perseverence perhaps you could give us a commentary on the beauty of both childhood innocence and motherly courage i might like that even lacking innocence there is still hope from my comments you might conclude that i didn't like your poem but you would be sadly mistaken i do like it i just think that it could be better after all you did ask what we think  Theory of conduct The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Humphrey Bogart Jon Secada Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Sin City The Amber Spyglass Milton H.

tell me what you think by some mischief of fate we might only truly fall in love once you know that one great love old folks refer to many lovers may get into our lives but there is only one person with that one smile one kiss one hug and one moment that our hearts will never replace that person usually but sadly is the one that got away that's why after all the chips are down we know we just know we'll never fall in love that way again serious answers please i think its true i liked it as a poem i think creativity in using descriptive words that convey emotion like analogies of what love is etc would help if creativity on explaining your thoughts was intended but i liked it because its so true my first love was very special to me if only i had enough lucky stars would she be still in my life and your right i have never fell in love like that again but its great to know i got to share some time with a great women maybe again will i be able to place as many chips on the table again from loving someone so much  Care Bears Love Frankie Laine Eastern Orthodox Church The Amber Spyglass A Course In Miracles Friendship Parsifal Cliff Richard Numerology One Tree Hill (TV series) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Yoga Storytelling Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Miss Saigon Jon Secada We'll Always Have Paris (TNG episode) Soul Max Stirner John Cassavetes Blood on the Tracks Father's Day (Doctor Who) Adam Mickiewicz Philipp Melanchthon Cordelia Chase Socrates Diana Ross Kiss The Jazz Singer One Life to Live Buffy Summers EastEnders Hellsing Fruits Basket The Picture of Dorian Gray Marilyn Monroe Meaning of life Incarnations of Immortality Carrie Jacobs-Bond Alena Juliet Tenchi Muyo!

i wrote it but it doesn't seem to flow most of my poetry doesn't rhyme and i've been experimenting opinions welcome always excuses excuses all sound the same lets find somewhere to lay the blame certainly not on the parents or the offspring let s just sue and see how much money it brings it s our generation all these little fucks mortgaging their futures to old navy and starbucks cup of coffee and making the minimum payment if we can our lives are owned by sally mae and uncle sam not to mention mom and dad they seem so proud of their little grad the last day of kindergarten we celebrate and the true milestones dissaparate and i know my puctuation and capitalization are erratic sorry dancing bee i like your answer i felt the same way about it however being a little brutal brings something out in people guess i may have been ranting a little the points you make in the poem are powerful and powerfully made i love the intensity you have here the trick is to keep the intensity in a more controlled form poetry even free verse yes i know this is not exactly free verse is tightly controlled language and can express powerfully through that control you noted the capitalization and punctuation so i won't belabor that a way to help with the flow is to begin by picking out lines that seem to either go on too long or lose the rhythm within the line count the number of syllables in each line and see if there are lines that stick out in this regard look also to see if there are phrases you can tighten up cutting words if you don't need them one line i would take as an example in large part because it sticks out quite a bit for me the line that begins cup of coffee has syllables far more than any other line it also seems to ramble within the line you could shorten it while retaining the near rhyme with the next line to simply buy four dollar coffee pay bills if we can it says the same thing but more tightly and more rhythmically i am not in the habit of re writing others' poetry and you may well find another better way to re write the line the point is to focus in line by line or even word by word and fine tune it  Poetry Meter (poetry) The Marshall Mathers LP Biblical poetry Rhyme Mnemonic Stuttering Rapping Alliterative verse Crossword Hey Jude The Adventures of Pete & Pete E.

my poem a parents vision comments as a small child crawling so tenderly not knowing now what in the future he ll be early in life we ll need to plan to grow him into a really great man we hope that his life will be true and be long and for that feat he ll need to be strong for in his life he ll share all its sorrows he ll take it in stride and plan for tomorrows if he is smart he ll learn to observe for sometime in life it will throw him a curve if he learns young there won t be much pain as we all know it can come down like rain and as he grows he can go anywhere we ll start him out young give him a dare we ll hope that he ll learn to explore there is so much out there for him to adore and when it is time for him to grow old we hope in his life he was truth full and bold and when all those years does takes it toll we ll look at his life we ve accomplished our goal good concept needs some editing though you're trying too hard at times and missing the obvious phrase for example if he is smart he ll learn to observe for sometime in life it will throw him a curve could have easily been if he's smart he'll learn to observe for sometimes life will throw you a curve or if he's smart he'll learn to observe because sometimes life throws you a curve you don't need to say him in both lines and if you're worried about using a cliche like life throwing you a curve then put it in quotes like this because sometimes life throws you a curve it doesn't let you completely off the hook but at least it's a recognition that the line has been used to the point of being cliche also don't feel like you have to add commas in the middle of a line if you don't want the reader to breathe there there is so much out there for him to adore reads just fine without the comma and there are many other lines that fall into the same category finally couplets are very difficult to pull off without sounding too rhymy they usually work when you want comedic effect not what you're trying for here in a sonnet not quite that either or any other poem that makes the couplet almost invisible because the rhyme sounds unavoidable as if no other word would have fit your couplets on the other hand rhyme as if they were forced to and it isn't surprising because like i said they are very difficult to do well the great poets make them seem easy but don't let that fool you into thinking that they actually are easy because they are not try an abab or abba pattern for example if we rearrange your last four lines and when it is time for him to grow old when all those years finally take their toll we hope his life was truthful and bold if so we d have truly accomplished our goal okay so there was a little editing of the last line too but can you see how rearranging the aabb to abab made the rhymes a little less rhymy you can try this with the other lines and with different patterns until you find one whose tone matches your subject the most closely keep writing  Jon Secada Rhyme scheme Rhyme Poetry Shakespeare's sonnets Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sonnet Equine conformation Shaggy dog story Motivation Humphrey Bogart Scenes from a Memory Tenshinhan Joke Meter (poetry) Chinese language E.

does anyone have a good poem for the theme faith hope and love i need an effective poem on those themes you definitely want to check out the poems of gerard manley hopkins he's a well known victorian poet at least among academic and poetry reading circles and jesuit priest historically he is known for his experiments in poetic meter particularly sprung rhythm even for an ardent agnostic as myself i find the unequivocating spirituality of his poems to be quite uplifting some notable poems to check out relevant to the your themes http www poemhunter com poem god s grandeur http www poemhunter com poem let me be to thee as the circling bird http www bartleby com html http www poemhunter com poem thou art indeed just lord if i contend another relevant poet to check out would be john donne pronounced dun he was raised catholic but was forced to convert to the anglican church due to political winds of the time at the insistence of king james he became a royal chaplain much of his work combines the sensual imagery of the physical world with the contemplative features of the spiritual world here are some links the first two are from a series called holy sonnets http rpo library utoronto ca poem html http rpo library utoronto ca poem html http rpo library utoronto ca poem html and for the sake of thematic contrast i suggest reading a poem that deals with the consequences of what happens in a world without faith hope and love james thomson wrote a long poem entitled the city of dreadful night where the speaker addresses directly the concepts of faith hope and love or more precisely the loss of those aspects of the human condition the most compelling part to me is part ii where the metaphor of a watch without its hands or face is compared to a human being functioning not really living without faith hope and love here's an excerpt the speaker is addressing probably one of the scariest tour guides of english literature where faith and love and hope are dead indeed can life still live by what doth it proceed as whom his one intense thought overpowers he answered coldly take a watch erase the signs and figures of the circling hours detach the hands remove the dial face the works proceed until run down although bereft of purpose void of use still go chilling stuff no here is the length to the full and lengthy poem http whitewolf newcastle edu au words authors t thomsonjames verse dreadnight dreadfulnight html  Gerard Manley Hopkins Literature English poetry William Shakespeare Poetry Walter J.

someone help me in understanding this lyric poem how do i love thee by elizabeth barret browning how do i love thee let me count the ways i love thee to the depth and breadth and height my soul can reach when feeling out of sight for the ends of being and ideal grace i love thee purely as they turn from praise i love thee with the passion put to use in my old griefs and with my childhoods faith i love thee with a love i seemed to lose with my lost saints i love thee with the breath smiles tears of all my life and if god choose i shall but love thee beter after death the first stanza means that the persona loves her lover with every inch of her soul hence the depth breadth and height thing she says that her soul is capable of this much love for hum when it is groping in the dark sightless it implies that the love she feels for him would be much greater if her soul was not constrained the second stanza says why she loves him 'for the ends of being and perfect grace ' it means that she loves him just for existing and for the ideal way that he is made she would not change any bit of him even if he could then she says that she loves him with both purity and passion in the third stanza the persona talks about lost saints if childhood in childhood wee often love things with a purity and acceptance that is missing form our later loves so she loves him in the way that a child loves with all its heart finally she says that she would love him even more after death god willing what she means is that she would probably love him more in heaven because things are perfect and full of joy in heaven unlike earth however she and her lover can only go to heaven if god wills it  Elizabeth Barrett Browning Love Duties of the Heart Ten Commandments Merit Eastern Orthodox Church Mary, the mother of Jesus Christian eschatology Virgin Mary in Islam Summa Theologiae Mortification of the flesh Justification (theology) Religion Reincarnation Divine grace The Amber Spyglass Contrition Jon Secada Purgatory Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Matthew 5 Hell Past teachings of Prem Rawat Prayer in Christianity Fallen angel Original sin Origin belief Shakespeare's sonnets Sant Thakar Singh Four Quartets Sri Aurobindo Jewish principles of faith Qiyamah Idolatry Vishnu sahasranama Baptism Simone Weil Paradise Lost Hymn Book of Isaiah Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology In Memoriam A.H.H.

poetry mechanics question i have a really hard time knowing how to differentiate the stresses in poetry how do i know if a word is stressed and how do i know if it's read as a light stress falling inflection right or a heavy stress rising inflection if i'm not mistaken i think i'm tone deaf annabella one quick question i am reading a book about poetry mechanics and in it the author shows examples of poems with iambic meter one thing that's really confusing me is how words like and the in at are sometimes stressed and sometimes not does it just depend on the over all rhythm of the poem yes that answers my question i learned about all of this mechanics business along time ago but then i just focused on free verse now i'd like to go back to understanding mechanics but it's proven to be a little tricky by the way i would've never guessed that you're not a native english speaker you write flawlessly if only i could write my second language that well well for me it's probably easier to know because as i am not an english native speaker i had to learn where to place the stresses in the words the english language is tonal and therefore musical a stress is marked by a higher pitch in the voice and it is also longer than a weak stress i will give you a simple example although it would be easier verbally when you say the word tradition you stress the second syllable tra di tion di is slightly longer than the other two and you voice slightly higher but if it is impossible for you to know exactly where you place the stress you can always check this in a dictionary most of them indicate where the stresses fall on line you can use http www thefreedictionary com they indicate the stress by putting an apostrophe after the stressed syllable tra di' tion good luck edit right now what you are talking about is stresses within a sentence there is the natural rhythm of the english language but poetry uses certain set rhythms a poem is a compromise between the two these small grammatical words are usually unstressed but they can be if they are part of a particular scansion and if it does not sound too artificial however a longer and significant word only has one possible stress for example in shakespeare's sonnet shall i compare thee to a summer's day the first line can be scanned as iambic pentameter although stressing to is somewhat artificial maybe an actor reading the poet would not stress it shall i compare thee to a summer's day hope i helped  Iambic pentameter Vowel Chinese language Non-native pronunciations of English Tone (linguistics) Literature English language Poetry Bulgarian language Slovak language Bengali language Dutch language Welsh language Spanish language Finnish language Lyric poetry Rhyme Shakespeare's sonnets Swedish language Vietnamese language Sanskrit Romanian phonology African American Vernacular English Stress (linguistics) Sonnet Hindi Alliterative verse Singlish Hebrew language Pinyin Taiwanese (linguistics) Lojban English as an additional language Biblical poetry Gothic language Serbo-Croatian language Dictionary Speech synthesis Slovenian language Inflection Kanji Second language acquisition Finnish grammar Basque language Varieties of Arabic Tamil language Portuguese language Korean language Phoneme Greek language Esperanto phonology American English German language New Zealand English English grammar Stuttering Grave accent Translation Esperanto grammar Alexandrine Ojibwe language Vulgar Latin William Shakespeare Russian language Finnish phonology Esperanto vocabulary Regional accents of English speakers Music Latin spelling and pronunciation Crossword German grammar Romance languages Japanese language Esperanto as an international language Gender-neutral language Latin poetry Russian phonology Grammatical mood Diacritic Spanish verbs John Berryman Japanese poetry Esperanto Scottish Gaelic language Grammatical aspect Acute accent Hearing impairment Urdu Syllable

i've seen a lot of poetry here at yahoo 's q a site in the past few months so i am currently considering launching an online ficition poetry magazine i had a pair of printed out small cirulation magazines between any interested parties let me know if i can find oh at least it will be out by the summer of next year the small circulation magazine doesn't have a name not yet therefore from now until the final friday of november the rd i will consider suggestions via email the person whose suggestion i wind up taking is guaranteed of publication in the premiere issue be sure to ask for complete guidelines when you submit your suggestion if i might make a suggestion or two or a dozen as someone who has done this endeavor i think it is important that you have a pretty clear vision upfront of what you want your magazine to look like there's about a half a zillion web magazines already out there so you need to think about how you will distinguish yourself from the others that first issue needs to have some impact and needs to generate for you the sort of buzz that will bring you quality submissions it is quite possible that you may be asking for authors to send you work for quite a few issues moving forward you should have a list of authors you really admire and would like to see your magazine reflect the kind of quality you envision your magazine offering the biggest mistake most web magazines make is to include too many authors in every issue less is better try to keep your authors down to or less you don't want to be the magazine that opens the floodgates and has so much work that no one ever bothers to read any of it because it's overwhelming concentrate on select pieces and don't be afraid to say no to work you don't like it's your magazine's reputation at stake always this also means you may have to say no to friends acquaintances idols and heroes they will send you crap especially if you let them you should announce your issues and submission calls go to the online workshops like alsopreview com and the writer's block at web del sol and others like eratosphere make sure you post a call for submissions with allison joseph at crwopps you can also try sending a notice to verse daily for their web monthly feature you should also do it right and invest the money in a dedicated site many a time webzines have started on angelfire or one of the other freebie websites it look unprofessional to most writers to see a bunch of box ads for creepy ol' poetry com at the top of the page you'll lose way more writers than you'll interest keep your deadlines if you are a quarterly then come out quarterly and hit your release dates if you say you answer submissions in weeks then you better do it in weeks or less the above commitments are a sign you are in it for the long haul and if you are not then you need to make sure you have a plan in place for someone else to take over otherwise you won't project to writers that sense of commitment in your interactions and you may find writers thinking of you as a flake good luck  Search engine optimization Open Directory Project Plame affair Literature Extreme Programming Google Craps Internet fraud E-mail spam DeviantART Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act The Standard Spam (electronic) Neopets Gmail The Chemical Brothers Theory of conduct MoveOn Poker jargon Wheel of Fortune The Apprentice 2 Web traffic Wikipedia Open access Crossword Nintendo Power Annuity On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Pretty Good Privacy Ken Jennings Stopping e-mail abuse Deconstruction Appeal Advertising Ajax (programming) Make money fast Legal research Crew Exploration Vehicle Corporate governance Peer review Monopoly (game) The Amazing Race Oxford English Dictionary Jennifer Lopez Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2005 MMORPG UK Singles Chart Slow Train Coming Opera (web browser) Kurt Cobain American Idol Parti Qu__b__cois leadership election, 2005 LiveJournal The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Billboard Hot 100 Erotic literature MTV2 Publishing Independent Media Center Chuck Palahniuk Surveillance Infantilism Kylie Minogue Religious Society of Friends The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Arianne Michael J.

do you like this poem you told me not to be so cliche so i tried something a bit different from my usual taste title the shadowing i stand alone a supernal breeze flows by as i catch my breath i close my eyes and count the seconds as they go by silence fills the air clouds engulf the sun the light sudden darkens i make no movements no words spoken rain slowly starts to pour the impossibility of summer rains grasping the opportunity overpower the sun but victory was short lived as the sun did rise again this is pretty good i can't find a line that sucks  Darken Rahl Indianapolis 500 Parallax Milton H.

what does free verse mean i have read this in some of the comments but i do not understand what it means would you be kind enough to educate me thank you free verse or open verse means just what it says free free of forced structure rhyme or meter pattern etc many confuse this with prose but the difference is that prose simply tells free verse shows sometimes the line is fine but like art you know it when you see it for example here is a free verse that walks that fine line between prose and poetry kyrie eleison tis the year of our lord an odd number itself factored by primes and strange too the events i ve witnessed this year grand master raymond de berenger of his holiness knights hospitiler of st john captured alexandria by sea burning a muslim pirate fleet there christ s vicar on earth our holy father pope urban the fifth dominus conservet eum ordered the restoration of the vatican so he could abandon holy avignon ending years of stability and the ottoman s having already raped thrace have taken adrianople and made it their capital surely god will turn talk of a great crusade against these blasphemers to action for they threaten more than empire but what can a modest holy man who must endure these times in humble silence do to change a world gone mad perhaps the answer lies in numbers for only numbers do not lie nor is their pure beauty swayed by political or royal flattery ars longa vita brevis and i fear i have neither art nor life i am alone poor without power and by his law without a wife kyrie eleison deus misereatur nostri et benedicat nobis inlustret faciem suam super nos semper benedicat nobis deus et timeant eum omnes fines terrae amen amen amen kevin m sorbello lord have mercy greek psalm may god have mercy on us and bless us may he cause the light of his countenance to shine upon us and may he have mercy on us latin psalm may god bless us and all the ends of the earth fear him latin the reason this leans away from prose is the way the words roll off the tongue and the images that are brought to mind are more than the words themselves convey the latin words are neither here nor there although they carry a message the use in this poem is for sound legitimacy of the speaker a th century monk in love with numbers and meaning when you read the words you almost taste them this is intentional and any good free verse poem must do something similar if it is to walk that fence on the side of poetry other free verse poetry is obscure fractured impactive and at times quite short like this one the glass breaks as words stop the phone drops the hand shakes the glass slips time slows silent fall ringing ears disbelief drink spills floor nears oh my god for goodness sakes they say she s dead the glass breaks kevin sorbello you'll notice that there are a couple lines that rhyme but not most of them this too is common especially when the poem wants to draw attention to a few lines the rhymes help do that i hope this helps  Requiem Mass (liturgy) Gloria in Excelsis Funeral of Pope John Paul II Poetry Vespers Pope Ten Commandments Eastern Orthodox Church Sola fide Meter (poetry) Holy Spirit Second Vatican Council Roman Catholic Church Amidah Jerusalem Book of Isaiah Sabbath Coptic Christianity Proven__al literature Simone Weil Rhyme Dispensationalism The Dunciad Nicene Creed Canonical hours Anglo-Saxon literature Qur'an Trinity King James Version of the Bible Dies Irae God and gender Mary, the mother of Jesus Christian views of Jesus Psalms Hell Biblical poetry Angel Literature Eucharist Summa Theologiae El (god) Samuel Wesley (poet) Filioque clause Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Book of Mormon Vulgate Apocrypha Vlad III Dracula Opus Dei Novel Suleiman the Magnificent Italian literature Te Deum Baptism Virgin Mary in Islam Sin Christian eschatology Bible English literature Bhagavad Gita Korban Rule of St Benedict Roman Emperor Alliterative verse Names of God in Judaism Articles of Religion (Methodist) Pope Benedict XVI God Save the Queen Good Friday Prayer Four Quartets Resurrection of Jesus Constantinople Merit Canticle of Zachary Martin Luther E.

what do you think of my poem i wrote this poem at a m this morning i just felt like writing something what do you think keep in mind im only and im still thinking of changing a few things the clock tick tick tick go the seconds of my hours and the hours of my days never again to be seen never again to be heard my days move on and so do my years however my mind still lingers there in the past it relives and rejoices those events lost by the ticking of the clock thus while my body grows tired and weak my mind still clinging to those memories of the past is joyful and full of vigor my body is the arm within the clock however my mind is the hand who sets it while the arm is inevitably trapped by the clock and the ticking away of time the hand can turn back the clock to a time and place where more joyful events had occurred na i dont mind if you add it to your notepad or whatever thanks for your comments chipmunk aka that was beautiful do you mind if i put this on word pad so i can reread it sometime you mastered those words and managed to fit them together to express your feelings so perfectly your poem is so true that it hurts simply perfect  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Simone Weil Mattress Time Out of Mind Past teachings of Prem Rawat Time Joy Electric Milton H.

opinions on a poem please i wrote this with the style of the lines rather than the complexities the phrases in mind in other words i know it's straight forward the last line of each stanza should be indented titled uncharacteristic my hands tremble like leaves my heart races faster still thoughts of you play continuously i yearn for your arms enwrap my shaken body never let go but i said no your eyes lock upon my own your face holds a daring expression soft lips kiss my shaken hands then caress past my cupids bow stay like this but i said no kissing my forehead and cheeks my brow furrows in wonderment can this truly be real conceive it is but i said no doubt dances upon my troubled mind a hazy picture of what was it is wrong i ll never say no again you're off to a very good start i liked the specificity of the work the attempt to capture the magic of the moment and the necessity to make a decision i enjoyed the declination of the lines very nice visual effect especially in free verse and three call outs use a different word than shaking in one of these lines and keep the verbs active shaking body shaking hands and try to change the yoda speak conceive it is very nice thank you for sharing your work  Swingout Salute Shaggy dog story Parsifal Bulgarian language Bowing (social) The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Gesture Miss Saigon Cupid and Psyche Sabbath Sonnet Volleyball Bhagavad Gita Jon Secada Customs and etiquette of Japan Characters of Naruto Poker jargon Aikido Sign language The Parting of the Ways Professional wrestling holds Narrator Lindy Basic Milton H.

a few questions about poetry i love writing poetry i have been writing poems for about years and i have won an award for one of my poems however i find it hard to write about something that i have not experienced myself maybe it's because i do not know what it's like being in other peoples shoes i don't know but how can i be more creative and step out of my shoes and into another persons another question is how can i get rid of writers block because i get it very often thanks if you're anything like me when you get writers block it's because you're attempting to force it and write on demand when this happens the most important thing to do is relax listen to music go take a walk somewhere if you must write don't try to write a complete piece just free write observations lines whatever comes to mind and save those snippets somewhere i often recognize new ideas from those fragments later to your first question while it's true that the more things you experience the more things you will be able to write about there are many things you would never want to experience and still will want to take a crack at i substitute lack of knowlege on a subject by interviewing people just asking questions so how did that make you feel wow what was that like etc observations of strangers or the world reading about it i just did a poem on howard hughes recently on this site i would hope never to experience his madness i'm reading through his notes memoirs and journals to get into his mindset and finally relate emotions and events you have felt to the other foreign emotion for example if someone close to you hasn't died yet but you want to write a poem about that focus on some loss you have experienced friend moving away divorce etc and transfer that emotion to the other event well i think i've rambled enough i hope some of that's helpful to you good luck with your writing take care  Poetry Beat generation Arthur Machen Theodicy A Course In Miracles Psychoanalysis Social rule George Oppen Out-of-body experience Sampling (music) Transactional analysis Theory of conduct Aesthetic Realism Polyamory John Berryman Socrates Milton H.

poem she chose to walk alone though others wondered why refused to look before her kept eyes cast upwards towards the sky she didn't have companions no need for earthly things only wanted freedom from what she felt were puppet strings she longed to be a bird that she might fly away she pitied every blade of grass for planted they would stay she longed to be a flame that brightly danced alone felt jealous of the steam that made the air its only home some say she wished too hard some say she wished too long but we awoke one autumn day to find that she was gone the trees they say stood witness the sky refused to tell but someone who had seen it said the story played out well she spread her arms out wide breathed in the break of dawn she just let go of all she held and then she was gone if you wrote that you need to write more soon  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cupid and Psyche Ayyavazhi mythology Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Sin City Naruto jutsu The Amber Spyglass EastEnders Characters of Naruto Avenue Q Piccolo Junior Saga The Vile Village Cosmic Era episode list Mid-Autumn Festival The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) The Star Wars Holiday Special Salad Fingers Shen Gong Wu Hyakujuu Sentai GaoRanger K' Kodocha Capercaillie Archery Conversion of Dale-Gudbrand The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Professional wrestling holds Tag Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic science fiction Rachel Corrie Tris Speaker The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Rave Master Neil Gaiman The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Jade Emperor Drowning Diving Jehovah's Witnesses Saruman Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Father's Day (Doctor Who) Milton H.

i don't really understand poetry weird i know help well i love poetry with deep meaning and usually i like it better if it rhymes but then there are some people who don't like when poetry rhymes since most good poems don't is there a certain way to write poems or does it really all just come down to a bunch of phrases with meaning of course i just don't really get how you write a poem i've never bought that baloney that good poetry doesn't rhyme read christina rossetti's goblin market and tell me that's no good it is so good in fact that although it was composed in as a children's story it was published in playboy magazine a century later and is still a topic of heated discussion today i actually prefer poetry that rhymes has a rhythm to it and tells a story or has such powerful imagery that you see and smell and taste what the author was imagining to me being able to convey a message is good but rising to the challenge of making it rhyme and have rhythm is even better  Poetry Literature Novel Christina Rossetti Imagism English poetry Rapping Japanese poetry Time Out of Mind Dr. Seuss Medieval French literature Lyric poetry Sonnet Haiku Eugene Onegin Robert Creeley Beowulf Rhyme Arabic poetry Irish poetry "Weird Al" Yankovic Arabic literature Rudyard Kipling Samuel Taylor Coleridge John Berryman Shit Thomas M.

does this poem get the message across or is it too defined of a lakeside all thrush's song and ripple's dance such beauty should yet cannot enchant you brought you here and dare not go but with all your rush you cannot know peace falls so near yet not so deep you focus on ends not this waking sleep but someday soon or someday late you know you'll return when time can wait you'll count no hours you will not know a race you've learned to sigh long and you can know this place tell me the good the bad and the ugly please as well as answering my qustion thanks i like the cadence and the tone here line feels a little clunky with the meter line did you mean to say you brought you here it's a bit confusing using the you pronoun twice in general i'd like to see more imagery throughout the poem i like stanza four quite a bit i think your strong stanzas are one and four i feel the middle of the poem needs a bit of clarity don't take this as harsh i can tell that you can write it's just that i feel you open up with two wonderful images there is a sublime sense to the poem and then it gets a little vague for me i don't know if that ramble helps i hope it did in some way  Poetry Jon Secada The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Infidels Meter (poetry) Four Quartets Time Out of Mind Social rule Das Lied von der Erde Pok__mon Live!

is this poem any good i started writing just recently as a way to calm myself down i heard there was going to be a poetry slam in a cafe by where i live so i figured i should try it this is what i've got so far when i was younger i could never embrace poetry it was never a form of art to me but then i heard artists like talib kweli changed my life and now i see i used to let my problems grow in me let my raw emotion take control of me but now i've found a way to let my soul breathe to remind myself who i am and who i want to be i only want to live this life as me 'cause the truth they say will set me free it's spoken poetry so it would sound better and it flows really nice i practiced in front of a mirror i'm not sure what to do with it though i think i'd like to make it the last stanza of something bigger any opinions comments etc you're right it does sound nicer read out loud surprisingly for poetry read on yahoo i do like this poem as long as you read it with raw emotion flooding from your soul it's going to sound great  Poetry Poetry of the United States John Berryman Performance poetry Stoicism Surrealist techniques Alternative hip hop Hip hop collaborations Slam poetry Sant Mat Simone Weil Urdu Vishnu sahasranama Alliterative verse Avenue Q Alfred Edward Housman Talib Kweli Phaedo Waka Aristotle C.

can you freelance short poems and such for a card company like write for hallmark and if so how hallmark has their own writing staff but you could contact smaller companies asking them to review consider your work sending them atleast different verses submit your poems on large index cards with your poem on the lined side if it's just for the inside of a greeting card but if you have an opening line or verse for the front of a greeting card put that on the front blank side of the index card with a series of dots following the last word to indicate the card should be turned over for the rest of the verse that goes inside the greeting card mail them in a large but not huge envelope so it doesn't get lost on their desk among other mail colored envelopes get their attention better than brown or yellow mailing envelopes or plain white envelopes you can enclose a postage paid envelope for the return of your cards so you can send them to another company but most companies return your cards with their acceptance rejection letter just to be safe you should copyright your verses before submitting them you won't have to worry about them being returned to you you could compile them into a book copyright the entire contents with one copyright instead of individual copyrights for each poem learn more about that at www copyright gov good luck  Mail United States Postal Service Envelope Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Direct marketing Postage stamp Yearbook Surveillance Mail fraud Poker jargon King James Version of the Bible Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Stamp collecting Copyright Blank verse Christmas card The Amazing Race Wheel of Fortune Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Mail art Topps Internet fraud Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Floppy disk Chicago Cubs Publishing Panay incident Plame affair 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Usenet Nintendo The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Robert Browning MAD Magazine Advance fee fraud Postcard OpenDocument Extreme Programming 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Baltimore Ravens Public domain Bank fraud Apple Computer Betting (poker) Library of Congress Battles of Lexington and Concord E-mail spam The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases MAME Poetry Perl Wget Open Directory Project Video game crash of 1983 Microsoft Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)

what is your favourite poem and favourite poet for what reasons while considered more of a songwriter than a poet my favorite poet is bob dylan aka robert zimmerman his work is pure genius and them some bob dylan is was very prolific some things he wrote aren't even attributed to him because other musical groups made the works popular like scarborough fair all along the watchtower mr tambourine man blowing in the wind one of my favorite works of his is i want you a beautiful song with an incredibly imaginative edge i will post the lyrics here maybe it's just me but this is descriptive poetry beyond the pale while it is surreal it is not off the wall his lyrics feel like they make sense even if once can't make the connection that is why he is a genius the guilty undertaker sighs the lonesome organ grinder cries the silver saxophones say i should refuse you the cracked bells and washed out horns blow into my face with scorn but it's not that way i wasn't born to lose you i want you i want you i want you so bad the drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep and the saviors who are fast asleep they wait for you and i wait for them to interrupt me drinkin' from my broken cup and ask me to open up the gate for you i want you i want you i want you so bad now all my fathers they've gone down true love they've been without it but all their daughters put me down 'cause i don't think about it well i return to the queen of spades and talk with my chambermaid she knows that i'm not afraid to look at her she is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see she knows where i'd like to be but it doesn't matter i want you i want you i want you so bad now your dancing child with his chinese suit he spoke to me i took his flute no i wasn't very cute to him was i but i did it though because he lied because he took you for a ride and because time was on his side and because i i want you i want you i want you so bad honey i want you  Bob Dylan Another Side of Bob Dylan Time Out of Mind Blood on the Tracks Infidels Blonde on Blonde Street-Legal The Times They Are A-Changin' Pet Sounds Highway 61 Revisited Empire Burlesque Leonard Cohen Desire (album) Shaggy dog story Jon Secada The Band Paul Is Dead John Wesley Harding (album) Poker jargon Love and Theft Van Morrison Tom Waits Oh Mercy The Amber Spyglass Country music Dylan Thomas The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Tears for Fears The Emancipation of Mimi George Harrison "Weird Al" Yankovic Brian Jones (musician) Poetry Slow Train Coming Salad Fingers Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Roy Orbison American Pie (song) Bob Marley Characters in the Smurfs John Berryman Humphrey Bogart Robert Schumann Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid (album) Beat generation Theory of conduct The Waterboys Social rule Jack Kerouac Music of the United Kingdom (1950s and 60s) Mark Calaway The Beatles World Gone Wrong The Human Stain Avenue Q The Basement Tapes Anne Rice The Beach Boys Knots Landing Alfred Edward Housman Rod Stewart Garth Brooks Great Teacher Onizuka Robert Browning EastEnders Plame affair Please Please Me AFI 100 Years series Mixtape Planet Waves Milton H.

come on people rip it apart i wanna know your thoughts feedback good and bad todays society a man walked down the street today was shot it bled him dry a girl awoke in some dark place was raped by some smooth guy a baby drowned by its mamas hand the tub was full and warm a woman cried he broke the vow and now she's full of scorn i sat back and watched it all the news is such a drag and if i only took a stand this world may better be but who has time to give a crap if the victim isn't me lisa thank you so much this is the second poem i've posted and i keep getting one line answers you just proved that there are people left in the world who think ta i apprecaie what you are doing believe me now the poem may not be appealing at all yet it has all the basic requirments to be considered poetry im a english major maybe my work stinks and i my spelling is worse but i can most deffinitly distingish poetry from prose so do a favor and supply educated responses in the furture thank you kristi i'll give a bit of both for you the subject matter and the words are cutting in a good way the dark apathy in the ending is particularly powerful i do think it can be improved as poetry to me the rhythm is actually too precise in this it reads a bit more sing songish than works with this subject matter i am also not sure why the end isn't broken into lines it reads the same in rhythm and rhyme scheme but is written out as though it were prose i can see a good argument for putting this in such a controlled almost light poetic style apathy typically involves falling into step in some way and adhering to a strict form does make sense in that regard still i think using some free verse with this to give it some ragged edges that fit the subject matter would improve it if that is what you were doing by writing the last section as you did then go the extra step to disrupt the rhythm and rhyme there rather than just eliminating the line breaks all in all nice work on this  Poetry Meter (poetry) Literature Alliterative verse Biblical poetry Rhyme Theory of conduct English grammar Glossary of partner dance terms Poker jargon Craps Rabindranath Tagore Translation Limerick (poetry) Theodicy Irish poetry Restoration literature Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Japanese poetry Sonnet Augustan literature Song Jon Secada Abortion debate Whose Line Is It Anyway?

poetry is in the soul not the learning you can study all the forms know all the great practitioners and never come close to this by a man who probably couldn't even write yonder sky that has wept tears of compassion upon my people for centuries untold and which to us appears changeless and eternal may change today is fair tomorrow it may be overcast with clouds my words are like the stars that never change whatever seattle says the great chief at washington can rely upon with as much certainty as he can upon the return of the sun or the seasons the white chief says that big chief at washington sends us greetings of friendship and goodwill this is kind of him for we know he has little need of our friendship in return his people are many they are like the grass that covers vast prairies my people are few they resemble the scattering trees of a storm swept plain the great and i presume good white chief sends us word that he wishes to buy our land but is willing to allow us enough to live comfortably this indeed appears just even generous for the red man no longer has rights that he need respect and the offer may be wise also as we are no longer in need of an extensive country there was a time when our people covered the land as the waves of a wind ruffled sea cover its shell paved floor but that time long since passed away with the greatness of tribes that are now but a mournful memory i will not dwell on nor mourn over our untimely decay nor reproach my paleface brothers with hastening it as we too may have been somewhat to blame youth is impulsive when our young men grow angry at some real or imaginary wrong and disfigure their faces with black paint it denotes that their hearts are black and that they are often cruel and relentless and our old men and old women are unable to restrain them thus it has ever been thus it was when the white man began to push our forefathers ever westward but let us hope that the hostilities between us may never return we would have everything to lose and nothing to gain revenge by young men is considered gain even at the cost of their own lives but old men who stay at home in times of war and mothers who have sons to lose know better our good father in washington for i presume he is now our father as well as yours since king george has moved his boundaries further north our great and good father i say sends us word that if we do as he desires he will protect us his brave warriors will be to us a bristling wall of strength and his wonderful ships of war will fill our harbors so that our ancient enemies far to the northward the haidas and tsimshians will cease to frighten our women children and old men then in reality he will be our father and we his children but can that ever be your god is not our god your god loves your people and hates mine he folds his strong protecting arms lovingly about the paleface and leads him by the hand as a father leads an infant son but he has forsaken his red children if they really are his our god the great spirit seems also to have forsaken us your god makes your people wax stronger every day soon they will fill all the land our people are ebbing away like a rapidly receding tide that will never return the white man's god cannot love our people or he would protect them they seem to be orphans who can look nowhere for help how then can we be brothers how can your god become our god and renew our prosperity and awaken in us dreams of returning greatness if we have a common heavenly father he must be partial for he came to his paleface children we never saw him he gave you laws but had no word for his red children whose teeming multitudes once filled this vast continent as stars fill the firmament no we are two distinct races with separate origins and separate destinies there is little in common between us to us the ashes of our ancestors are sacred and their resting place is hallowed ground you wander far from the graves of your ancestors and seemingly without regret your religion was written upon tablets of stone by the iron finger of your god so that you could not forget the red man could never comprehend or remember it our religion is the traditions of our ancestors the dreams of our old men given them in solemn hours of the night by the great spirit and the visions of our sachems and is written in the hearts of our people your dead cease to love you and the land of their nativity as soon as they pass the portals of the tomb and wander away beyond the stars they are soon forgotten and never return our dead never forget this beautiful world that gave them being they still love its verdant valleys its murmuring rivers its magnificent mountains sequestered vales and verdant lined lakes and bays and ever yearn in tender fond affection over the lonely hearted living and often return from the happy hunting ground to visit guide console and comfort them day and night cannot dwell together the red man has ever fled the approach of the white man as the morning mist flees before the morning sun however your proposition seems fair and i think that my people will accept it and will retire to the reservation you offer them then we will dwell apart in peace for the words of the great white chief seem to be the words of nature speaking to my people out of dense darkness it matters little where we pass the remnant of our days they will not be many the indian's night promises to be dark not a single star of hope hovers above his horizon sad voiced winds moan in the distance grim fate seems to be on the red man's trail and wherever he will hear the approaching footsteps of his fell destroyer and prepare stolidly to meet his doom as does the wounded doe that hears the approaching footsteps of the hunter a few more moons a few more winters and not one of the descendants of the mighty hosts that once moved over this broad land or lived in happy homes protected by the great spirit will remain to mourn over the graves of a people once more powerful and hopeful than yours but why should i mourn at the untimely fate of my people tribe follows tribe and nation follows nation like the waves of the sea it is the order of nature and regret is useless your time of decay may be distant but it will surely come for even the white man whose god walked and talked with him as friend to friend cannot be exempt from the common destiny we may be brothers after all we will see we will ponder your proposition and when we decide we will let you know but should we accept it i here and now make this condition that we will not be denied the privilege without molestation of visiting at any time the tombs of our ancestors friends and children every part of this soil is sacred in the estimation of my people every hillside every valley every plain and grove has been hallowed by some sad or happy event in days long vanished even the rocks which seem to be dumb and dead as the swelter in the sun along the silent shore thrill with memories of stirring events connected with the lives of my people and the very dust upon which you now stand responds more lovingly to their footsteps than yours because it is rich with the blood of our ancestors and our bare feet are conscious of the sympathetic touch our departed braves fond mothers glad happy hearted maidens and even the little children who lived here and rejoiced here for a brief season will love these somber solitudes and at eventide they greet shadowy returning spirits and when the last red man shall have perished and the memory of my tribe shall have become a myth among the white men these shores will swarm with the invisible dead of my tribe and when your children's children think themselves alone in the field the store the shop upon the highway or in the silence of the pathless woods they will not be alone in all the earth there is no place dedicated to solitude at night when the streets of your cities and villages are silent and you think them deserted they will throng with the returning hosts that once filled them and still love this beautiful land the white man will never be alone let him be just and deal kindly with my people for the dead are not powerless dead did i say there is no death only a change of worlds you said it brudda poetry does indeed reside in the soul not the mind one is truly a poet only when intellect and emotion speak with one voice i live in the land that this great poet speaks of south coastal british columbia and can understand how he came to speak as he does the landscape i inhabit is one of mist and infinite shades of green and blue where edges are blurred and the seasons blend and the ravens still speak with men's voices along the river's edge there is magic in the forests still even though we scape bare the mountain sides to feed our avarice as a young boy i would wander in the woods to a place where the cedars where giants and the forest floor was carpeted with moss so thick and soft it was hard to walk and even in high summer the air was cool still and dark i would lay on that bed of moss in the filtered green light and feel safe and happy now that so many years have passed i know that what i had was rare and precious and made me the man i am today those hours spent alone in the bush with the ancients is a gift that i will keep forever

a bit of a change tell me what you think so poem it's a bit of a change from those prior though still rather awful tell me what you think oh as an aside the last time i wrote a poem the lines kind of spilled over so an accidental lack of punctuation and capitalization occurred and i went on vacation without my computer and had no chance to select a best answer sorry to anyone who cares i voted for the answer i liked best anyway even that which is not it's just so beautiful and i can't help but sigh each time this beauty leaves my sight my hearing and my touch my senses i can't help but regret the times the times i've witnessed this beauty and failed to act upon the things i feel inside the things that i think i should naturally be doing but can't bring myself to do ah but everything is so silly and i can't help but laugh at the things i've done and look forward to the tings i might yet do with as much anticipation as trepidation i ran out of room i'm always so scared but always so calm and relaxed always so sad yet never happier i suppose thats the way things in life take form at least for me all is balanced in a chaotic sort of way balance is everything and everything is balanced this is the only universal truth that i hold to the only philosophy that i accept as fact it is the basis of all that i am at least for now everything is so beautiful this world we live in for all it's faults and horrors and ugliness is exquisitely beautiful if it was not then we would never know beauty and all of humanity would be cursed i fear that our children will live in a world bereft of all beauty it is this thought above all else that truly chills me this music is so wonderful and even though i can't understand the words i understand the meaning for that is the way of music and that is beautiful what is beauty all is beautiful even that which is not this is good it needs to be cooked down a little try to say this in four line stanzas  Theory of conduct Ethics Supernatural Simone Weil Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Death Gate Cycle God Emperor of Dune Goodness and value theory Shaggy dog story Intelligent design The nature of God in Western theology Theodicy Determinism Deconstruction Time Out of Mind Science Anthroposophy Bernard Williams The Amber Spyglass Francis Hutcheson (philosopher) Philosophical skepticism Dualism (philosophy of mind) Kain (Legacy of Kain) Aesthetic Realism Cyberspace Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Meaning of life Kasparov versus The World Philosophy of language Das Lied von der Erde Phaedo E.

is this man a poem i wrote would like feedback and comments i need some feedback on this piece is it too short or short and to the point too descriptive etc thanks a lot in advance it this man to strip your child bare and from your own hand make leather belt strike skin is this man to ignore the screams of remorse and the red welts left behind in the belt's destructive path is this woman to stand idly by attempting to ignore the sounds of the screams and belt meeting skin my only criticism is that the title or first line should read is this man the rest is great it is a tough subject matter and you handle it with a bluntness that mimics that subject matter a poem doesn't have to be long to be great i actually like the remorse line because it speaks to the victims feelings of guilt even though no one deserves to be beaten it seems that many abuse victims feel like they deserve the abuse in someway i hope this didn't happen to you if it did i hope you are seeking emotional support and help  Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Sin City Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Yoko Ono Notable lines in the Star Wars series Corporal punishment Time Out of Mind Transactional analysis Timpani Spanking The Marshall Mathers LP Textile manufacturing Theory of conduct Daredevil Scenes from a Memory O.

im what do you think of my poem when people say it will seem like nothing next year when you attempt to right your feelings down onto a blank page and all you can do is think about that one thing that one thing that turned into a million little things the pale grey colour that is your mixed feelings and not knowing what those feelings are only makes the fear of feeling anything deeper and deeper whether it is red with anger white with sadness or green with guilt and the longing to let everyone no your side of the story before that deceiving angelic face opens its mouth and recites words dripping with lies and over dramatic line s sounding so rehearsed but only you no the truth the deep emotions within your body wind up until they implode and sleeplessness can onley make your cuts that turn into scars seem so un important and all that happens is the big black hole gets bigger and wider sucking in every last emotion and once of energy that you had left to take that deep breath in that made you feel just that much better and all you have to hope that the black hole sucks up every last bit of those emoticons that you are so longing to get rid of whether you did do something wrong they still top it but those with a face of an angel often turn into a black muddy puddle with the ripples of trouble effecting everyone that hears the story but you no the truth all you wish for is that it will all end all end and go away for you no running from the black hole will only leave it there waiting for your return waiting to see what you have become waiting to judge you with snaring eyes and a curled lip but you have no control over what this black hole will do next all you can do is sit in the dark and wait for it sit and wait alone hmm to adolecent if you new the things i have been through you would not of said that but thats just it lol you dont no thankyou for your answer though i can definitely identify with the emotions in your poem and by the way your feelings are your own and they are valid no matter what your age is in fact writing down your feelings is one of the first steps in dealing with them and that is a mark of maturity i would suggest that you use spell check and work on possessives capitalization and punctuation in other words grammar and spelling i know those things seem boring but grammatical errors can prevent people from immersing themselves completely in a poem keep writing that's the best way to keep improving  Religion The Amber Spyglass Poker jargon Drill bit Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jon Secada Time Out of Mind Emoticon Blood on the Tracks Color Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Force (Star Wars) Bong Poetry Origin belief Emotion Daredevil Social rule Scientology beliefs and practices Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mosquito Diving Theory of conduct Breastfeeding Domestic violence Scenes from a Memory Leet Captain Thunderbolt One Tree Hill (TV series) Snooker Saruman Transformers: Cybertron Deconstruction Blonde on Blonde EastEnders Shen Gong Wu Milton H.

a bit of a change tell me what you think so poem it's a bit of a change from those prior though still rather awful tell me what you think oh as an aside the last time i wrote a poem the lines kind of spilled over so an accidental lack of punctuation and capitalization occurred and i went on vacation without my computer and had no chance to select a best answer sorry to anyone who cares i voted for the answer i liked best anyway even that which is not it's just so beautiful and i can't help but sigh each time this beauty leaves my sight my hearing and my touch my senses i can't help but regret the times the times i've witnessed this beauty and failed to act upon the things i feel inside the things that i think i should naturally be doing but can't bring myself to do ah but everything is so silly and i can't help but laugh at the things i've done and look forward to the tings i might yet do with as much anticipation as trepidation i ran out of room i'm always so scared but always so calm and relaxed always so sad yet never happier i suppose thats the way things in life take form at least for me all is balanced in a chaotic sort of way balance is everything and everything is balanced this is the only universal truth that i hold to the only philosophy that i accept as fact it is the basis of all that i am at least for now everything is so beautiful this world we live in for all it's faults and horrors and ugliness is exquisitely beautiful if it was not then we would never know beauty and all of humanity would be cursed i fear that our children will live in a world bereft of all beauty it is this thought above all else that truly chills me this music is so wonderful and even though i can't understand the words i understand the meaning for that is the way of music and that is beautiful what is beauty all is beautiful even that which is not it's a bit long i do like it though there's a lot of emotions showed in this  Theory of conduct Ethics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Simone Weil Supernatural God Emperor of Dune The Death Gate Cycle Time Out of Mind Epistemology Shaggy dog story Intelligent design The Amber Spyglass Dualism (philosophy of mind) Determinism Deconstruction The nature of God in Western theology Goodness and value theory Meaning of life Bernard Williams Theodicy Philosophy of language Science Anthroposophy Francis Hutcheson (philosopher) Philosophical skepticism Aesthetic Realism Phaedo Jon Secada Objectivist philosophy Darth Vader Kain (Legacy of Kain) Cyberspace Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Discordianism Aristotle Arthur Schopenhauer K' I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Friedrich Schleiermacher Immanuel Kant Immortality Metaphysics Sigmund Freud David Hume Problem of universals Rudolf Hermann Lotze Boards of Canada Creationism Kasparov versus The World Nicomachean Ethics Social rule Art Milton H.

just wrote a new poem not love or heartbreak btw can someone tell me how it is and rate it wouldn't life be perfect if the drama would disappear if we could go to rest at night without any fear if we could fall in love once and have it everlasting if all the insecure people would stop harming thier lives by fasting if students could go to school without an abundance of stress if you could love someone so much and not be obsessed if we could watch the news and not see people in tears if we could go talk to best friends we haven't seen in years sometimes i wish life could be different but sometimes i like it the same because what doesn't kill you makes you stronger the battle of life is a game i'm trying to write better poems so if you could could give me any tips on what you think i could do better let me know the idea of the perfect world you painted was leaving me with the feeling where would the adventure be what challenges would need meet why would we dream when while we where awake it would be all the dreams we need the shortness made it easy to enjoy it because you didn't explain the same thing in differant ways and i would rate this poem a very nice good painted picture with few words  Theory of conduct One Tree Hill (TV series) Scenes from a Memory W.I.T.C.H.

poem named lady in shadows what do you think immaculate body of mist appearing glorious to all eyes dismissing mistress of all sins forever married to no love provoking presence of mankind approaching eager crazy sights away getting from all that s lust for still does vanish she from love thanks for any comments it's got some pretty vague imagery in it for example what do you mean by the words immaculate glorious sins love etc these are the types of words that should be shown to the audience describe them don't just name them a couple of your sentences are very awkward syntactically especially the line that's second from the last i get the gist after reading them a couple of times but it would be easier to understand if you were to use proper sentence structure finally i think the last line of the first verse makes little logical sense again i know what you mean but try to find a more logical way to say it  Philosophy of language Eastern Orthodox Church E.
