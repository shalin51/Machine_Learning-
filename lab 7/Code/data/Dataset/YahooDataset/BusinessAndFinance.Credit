what is a good way to improve credit for a year old with bad credi and a credit score the reason why my score is so low is when i was i signed up for a website from and internet for a project when i was done i forgot to cancel and i kept getting billed for a month for months now i have nco on my reporting as a paid debt but its still just as bad and even though i paid in debt it shows up on my report times each or so right now i have a bank of america secured card every month i use about on it and when its due i pay the whole each time ive had it since may updated based on your details it sounds like your focus should be on the bad marks on your account if you're sure that the company shows the account as paid and closed you can simply contest the entries with the three credit bureaus and see what happens often the company that posted those bad marks won't respond and they will be removed this might also remove that entire account from your credit report which probably won't hurt you you might also try begging and pleading with the company that left the bad marks explain that it was a mistake that you did the right thing and paid in full and that this is hurting you financially now you may have to go through several people there before you find one who can or will help you worst case might be that you keep the bad marks but put a statement on each of your credit reports explaining them the nolo page in the url below explains all of this  Credit card Plame affair Student loan Internet fraud Debt Phishing Unemployment United Kingdom corporation tax Deflation (economics) Mortgage Financial audit Social Security (United States) Credit repair GameFAQs Mutual fund Bank fraud Star Trek: Enterprise Babe Ruth H2G2 Sydney Riot of 1879 Schabir Shaik Trial U.S. public debt Theory of conduct Corporate governance The Amazing Race Temasek Holdings Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Pittsburgh Steelers Credit history Money U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Hyperinflation Ford Motor Company Neopets Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Financial services 1957 World Series Inflation Annuity Enron Corporation Open Directory Project Gold standard Economy of Russia America Online Poker jargon Bank 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Search engine optimization Personal finance Citigroup Octopus card Mail Cindy Sheehan Interest Dave Ramsey Bank of America Web crawler Mergers and acquisitions Microeconomics Whose Line Is It Anyway?

minor can ruin their credit nco is evil when i was i forgot to pay a couple of bills which was placed on my credit is this possible the charges started in january i was my birthday was in may and the debt was put on my account in october shouldnt this be taken of my credit since i was only when the charges were incurred i have already paid the debt it was for but they put it on my account as like or times even though it shows up on my report it shows as paid which is just as bad surprisingly itonly shows on my experian my trans union and equifax are clean it was for a website that i registerd to do a project after i was done with it i forgot to cancel it and they kept billing me for like months and i saw a letter in the mail saying i owed and now its showing on my report as nco fin the domain people were and internet and the worse thing is it doesnt show up once as it shows up times as or so a collection agency cannot legally place more than one trade line for the same account on your credit reports by placing it on your reports or times they are seriously violating your rights it seems nco does not care if they violate the fcra and fdcpa even after they had to pay out million for their fcra violations experian is evil and very hard to deal with but you should try and dispute the accounts on one page list each account name of account account number reporting reported by nco etc then say that they are duplicate accounts they are violating your rights by being reported and that you are requesting deletion of all of the accounts do not include in that dispute that it is your account that it should be reported as not that the account is paid etc in other words never offer any info that would show that it is your account offering info that the account is yours will make it harder for you to make ex do what they are supposed to do what may happen is that nco may delete all of them may not verify them and ex will have to delete may verify all of them may correct the amount and remove all but one if nco verifies all of the accounts then file complaints with the bbb the ftc your ag and nco's ag wait a few days to give nco the chance to realize you had filed those complaints then file another dispute with ex and include a copy of your ftc complaint with your dispute send all of your disputes to ex by certified mail keep copies of everything create a paper trail since you had already paid the account nco cannot sue you for it but you sure can sue nco for the violations if they keep all of them on your report  Credit repair SCO-Linux controversies Experian Internet fraud 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Credit score Neopets Florida Central Voter File Credit card ITunes Advance fee fraud Stopping e-mail abuse Wal-Mart United States Postal Service SCO v.

once you pay an outstanding debt how long before it comes off your credit report can you call experian directly and fax proof of a debt being paid in full in hopes of it coming off or showing as a paid debt sooner i want to rent an apartment but a bad debt from the past is stopping me i paid the debit but the new apartment company wants to see it reflected in the credit report and not excepting the letter and reciept proving i paid the debit in full what can i do to hurry this process up usually creditors update with credit bureaus once a month usually the begining of the month so if you paid sometime this last week it will not show as paid on your credit report until september most likely sending the info to exeprian yourself will likely not get it done any faster unless you negotiated the removal of the debt when you paid the item off it will not actually be removed from your credit report for years it will show as settlement paid if you didn't negotiate anything else with the collections bureau http www creditinfocenter com rebuild  Credit card Credit repair Mortgage Debt Double-entry book-keeping Schabir Shaik Trial Internet fraud Bond Credit score TransUnion Financial audit Social Security (United States) Deflation (economics) Debt levels and flows Surveillance Debt consolidation Economy of Chile Debit card Toll road Interest Student loan Estoppel United Kingdom corporation tax Bank The Amazing Race Bank fraud Unemployment Money Legal tender Economy of Russia Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Annuity Article One of the United States Constitution Payroll Mensal__o scandal Accountancy Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Experian Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Credit default swap Cheque Electronic toll collection Mail Derivative (finance) Accounting methods Gold standard Mergers and acquisitions Warren Buffett Argentine debt restructuring World Wide Web Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code Personal finance EFTPOS Leasehold estate Fractional-reserve banking Hyperinflation Web crawler Billboard Hot 100 Tom DeLay Marshall Plan Temasek Holdings Finance Telegraphy MMORPG Babylonian law Phishing Corporation Security (finance) Timeline of the Enron scandal Paul Martin Barrister Financial services Education in Germany Bretton Woods system Fiat money Insurance Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Cyprus dispute Ozone depletion Primerica Financial Services Treasury security Child support Common Unix Printing System Schapelle Corby Bob and George Debt bondage FairTax Credit rating agency Government debt London Congestion Charge RFID Taxation in the United States Advance fee fraud Rent (musical) Arbitrage Reparations for slavery Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mac OS X Enron Corporation

how long does it take to generate a credit score never having one before and could i get a loan after h you will need about a month after getting your first credit to generate a score it will start pretty low your first debt might be a secured credit card or very low limit it takes a while to see what kind of borrower you are if you have security for a loan and high income you may be able to borrow but it isn't likely without a cosigner since you are a new borrower and nobody likes to take the risk  Student loan Debt Credit card Mortgage Interest Short selling Predatory lending Insurance Bank fraud Municipal bond Bond Microcredit Credit history Deflation (economics) Bank Arbitrage Monetary policy Collateralized debt obligation Money Government debt Mortgage-backed security Debt levels and flows Debt consolidation Lender of last resort United Kingdom corporation tax Refinancing Usury Credit score Security (finance) Deficit Finance Corporate finance Credit rating agency Asian financial crisis Credit risk Financial markets Payday loan Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Economy of Pakistan Capital accumulation Repurchase agreement Hearts (game) Donald Trump Leeds United F.C.

what to do with a payed off credit card i just recently paid of my credit card and have heard two different options is it better to just not use the card at all or to use it once or twice a month and pay it off every bill what exactly is revolving credit the basic way that a credit score is rated is by comparing the amount of available credit to the amount of credit being used anything above of your available credit being used is a negative and will lower your score has no effect to your score other than your payment history below is a positive on your credit the more available credit you have that you are not using shows that you are managing your debt correctly and are not a high risk borrower i hope that this helps  Credit card Credit score Student loan Bond Mortgage Interest Credit history Collateralized debt obligation Bank Debt Money Deflation (economics) Finance Insurance Government debt Taxation in the United States Derivative (finance) Municipal bond Inflation Monetary policy Mortgage-backed security Minimum wage United Kingdom corporation tax Primerica Financial Services Blackjack Life insurance Futures contract Rational pricing Debt consolidation Economy of Pakistan Corporate finance Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Credit risk Social Credit Refinancing Short selling Social Security (United States) Annuity Social Security debate (United States) Economy of Russia Predatory lending Jeopardy!

what possible suggestion could be used to answer the question of national debt this is the us national dept http www brillig com debt clock use this graph http www brillig com debt clock faq html and tell me what you think would be a great way to try to reduce our national debt the best way to do this would be to eliminate the federal reserve and go back to the gold standard back before when the federal reserve was created people used gold and silver certificates which looked like regular dollars but could actually be traded for gold and silver at the bank this way the money always had gold and silver to back it and the economy was booming still today we have dollars that say 'federal reserve note' which means no longer can we go to the bank and get gold and silver but it's just really a piece of paper with no value also before nickels quarters and dimes were made of silver now they are not again i will say that the way to go would be to pay our massive debt back to the federal reserve and shut it down permanently once that's done we could either go back to the gold standard or create a new system i personally have an idea that if everyone in the united states dedicated themselves to donate dollar each every week to our national debt that we could have the debt paid off by the end of the year think about it million people in the united states thats million paid to the national debt each week but then everyone would have to have a knowledge of our debt to do so i hope this was helpful  United States dollar Gold standard Money Fiat money U.S. ten-dollar bill Legal tender Philippine peso Silver Certificate U.S. one hundred-dollar bill Pound sterling Monetary policy U.S. public debt Canadian dollar Economy of the United States Federal Reserve U.S. fifty-dollar bill Money supply Government debt Euro United States Mint Economic history of the United States Deflation (economics) Australian dollar Bretton Woods system Currency Fractional-reserve banking In God We Trust U.S. two-dollar bill Canadian federal election, 1993 Marshall Plan Gold as an investment Bond Reaganomics Banknote Economy of the Philippines Wal-Mart United States coinage Nickel (U.S. coin) United States dollar coin Credit card U.S. twenty-dollar bill Monetarism Unemployment Supply-side economics Tax protester Economy of Colombia Gold Economy of Guyana Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Great Depression Mexican peso Romania Silver standard Capital accumulation Economy of Africa Debt British coinage Temasek Holdings Romanian leu Economy of Pakistan International Monetary Fund Social Credit Economy of Sri Lanka Bank Hong Kong dollar World Wide Web Economy of Brazil Argentine Currency Board Donald Trump Great Depression in Canada Minimum wage Asian financial crisis New Orleans Mint FairTax History of the United States (1918-1945) Social Security (United States) Dime (U.S. coin) Great Depression in the United Kingdom Bankruptcy Arthur Laffer Economy of Australia Kyoto Protocol Economy of Zimbabwe Bank of England Phishing Corporation Economy of El Salvador Argentine debt restructuring United States Army Great Depression in Australia Charles Ponzi

did boa send me the wrong card i applied for a boa visa platinum plus card and i've received it in the mail after many complicated issues just to get it approved however it doesn't say visa platinum plus the letter that came with it calls it a preferred visa the card is white with a red and blue bank of america 'flag' logo covering most of it and says bank of america in blue letters across the top it's a visa but is this the same visa platinum plus card that i applied for i don't see anything plus anywhere on the letter or card itself and it's not gray like the one online the background image is the same for whatever crazy reason what is this card exactly i remember reading something a while back in some of the boa fine print on the website or something that there is a rate for preferred card members and one for plus cardmembers with of course the plus seemingly getting the much better apr rates and such did i apply for a plus card and get bumped down to a preferred for some reason the credit analyst who approved it over the phone gave me a credit limit on it i've had a gold card for about years now which has a credit limit and zero balance recently paid off but the card was of course utilized very well and paid a lot over the time thus the increases since it started as a card i'm still wanting to try to consolidate the boa gold card credit line hopefully into this new one to get rid of that annual fee with the gold the analyst didn't want to give me much of a limit on the new card seemingly grudging that i already had the cl on the gold and planned to combine them at some point is this preferred visa a good card to have or just one of those average joe general credit cards with crappy rates promo apr through february closing statement the fine print states after the promo margin of percentage points this currently results in a corresponding apr i was approved over the phone directly by a credit analyst for a visa platinum plus and it looks like they've sent me a preferred plus seems to get better rates preferred seems to get crappy rates oh yeah and just so that it doesn't look like i'm getting another card just for getting it i am changing the gold card because of a annual fee that i'm sick of and don't want to call each year to get waived i would suggest a visit to your local boa office they should be able to answer all of your questions  Credit card Plame affair Citigroup Octopus card Surveillance Internet fraud VISA (credit card) H-1B visa Microeconomics The Amazing Race Life insurance United States Postal Service Inflation Virgin Mobile Visa (document) Yu-Gi-Oh!

can i still claim back my bank charges even though a test case is going before the crwon court i have already served legasl notice abbey national for about weeks ago then last week a group of national banks have joined together and asked permission to test a case in the high court which could take years meanwhile trading standards have announced that banks do not have to support anyone claiming fees before the test case can i still proceed using the unfair terms in the cosumer contract regulations act on my own through the county court no one seems to know also can i still proceed against credit card companies it is a goos thing that you have already srved your notice as even if you have to wait a year you still will be able to clain for everything you have asked for even if due to the delay you go over the year mark i think that even the county courts are starting to put these on hold too until the outcome of the test case but if it is already going through then you never know you should get a response from either the courts or the bank either way remember this is may be a delay but at the moment it is not a rejection so providing the test case goes your way then you will still get what you are trying to claim also see http www moneysavingexpert com  SCO-Linux controversies Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Article One of the United States Constitution Public domain Insurance Bank Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 SCO v.

if i cancel my credit card interest is ridiculous will my interest charges stop also you sound you got yourself in the trap so many have gotten in in the past the best thing to do is to absolutely stop using your credit card for any purchases at all i don't know how much you owe but the credit card companies want to keep you hooked on and dependent on them for as long as they possibly can we ran up a disastrously high credit card bill in the late s and somehow managed to pay it off and then cut up the card but it took a lot of self discipline on our part our son in college did the same thing in the mid s and did the same thing as long as you have a balance they will continue to charge you exorbitant rates of interest so you cannot solve the problem by simply cancelling your account there are many legitimate and some not so legit organizations which will help you manage control and limit your debt but many of them will only help you if your debt is at least in today's world you seemingly cannot avoid having at least one credit card but you have to learn to not use it unless absolutely necessary we currently have several credit cards but it doesn't matter what the rate of interest is as we pay the amount owed in full each month and never use them to get cash advances a cash advance incurs interest even if you pay it off in full in days time one or two of the cards we have allow us days to pay with no interest due if regular payments are made on a timely basis and the entire amount is paid by the end of the period a couple cards we have actually allow a longer period of tme to pay without incurring interest these are potentially dangerous to use if you do not have a lot of self discipline in that a lot can happen in a longer period of time and if you miss or are late making one payment you are suddenly liable for interest payment from day one  Credit card Debt Student loan Insurance Mortgage United Kingdom corporation tax Bank Microeconomics Deflation (economics) Mutual fund Annuity Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus FairTax Credit score Life insurance Keynesian economics Personal finance Internet fraud Money U.S. public debt Bond Monetary policy Gold standard Bretton Woods system Government debt PE ratio Bank fraud Predatory lending Octopus card Surveillance Hyperinflation Corporate finance Taxation in the United States Islamic banking Debit card Cheque Food Stamp Program Social Security (United States) Arthur Laffer Security (finance) EFTPOS Auto insurance The Amazing Race Yield curve Primerica Financial Services Health insurance Ponzi scheme Economy of Russia Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Short selling Professional wrestling slang Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Credit derivative Mergers and acquisitions Debt consolidation Ashton-Tate Treasury security Credit card fraud Inflation Universal life insurance Variable universal life insurance Deficit spending Baccarat Abortion debate Schabir Shaik Trial Accounting methods Salary cap Athenian democracy Wheel of Fortune Collateralized debt obligation Public transport Article One of the United States Constitution Free trade Financial services Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Child support Philosophy of language Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Dividend Individual Savings Account Betting (poker) Liability Micropayment United States Postal Service International Computers Ltd Futures contract Plame affair Public-key cryptography Drug test Wachovia Corporation

should i cancel my credit card for this reason i have my credit card all paid off but they keep charging me these stupid and cent fees i hear you are not supposed to cancel a credit card because it will lower your credit rating but i am sick of paying these stupid fees i have never been late on a payment or anything i don't know why i am being charged this crap the reason canceling a credit card can lower your score is that it can disrupt your open credit ratio of your credit score is calculated by looking at how much credit you have available compared to how much you have used if you have a card completely paid off and a card with a balance you have used of your available credit used of a total of credit if you close the card your used credit will be or of total credit in general you want to keep your used credit under of your total available credit so you will have to look at your personal situation to determine if closing this card will help or hurt you call your credit card company and ask about the fees they sound like some sort of monthly maintenance fees ask them to stop charging the fees or ask if they have a different card with better terms  Credit card Insurance Mortgage Credit score Mutual fund Virgin Mobile PE ratio Bank United States Postal Service Credit card fraud Citigroup Annuity Micropayment Interest Microeconomics Debt Credit history Taxation in the United States Predatory lending Deflation (economics) Craps Poker jargon Inflation EFTPOS Primerica Financial Services Tax Octopus card Health insurance Dividend Blackjack Life insurance Annual percentage rate SmartRider Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Telephone card Wal-Mart Personal finance Copyleft Cable television Bond National Insurance Refinancing Surveillance United Kingdom corporation tax Internet fraud Hearts (game) FairTax Skype Filling station Publicly funded medicine Debt consolidation America Online Government debt Euro American Express Bretton Woods system Payphone London Congestion Charge Debit card Money Auto insurance Unemployment benefit Managed care Sears Holdings Corporation Short selling GSM services Donald Trump Xbox Live Cribbage Schabir Shaik Trial Game programmer London Underground Tuition Television licence Impedance E-ZPass Tertiary education fees in Australia Baccarat Loudspeaker Dice Economy of Russia Space Shuttle program Public domain British national identity card Credit default swap Finance Topps Toll road Credit derivative Mainframe computer Social Security (United States) Corporate finance Card game Betting (poker) Punch card Slot machine Leasing

debt consolidation ok i am about thousand dollars in debt they were originally hospital bills but have been forwarded to the collection agency they are about a year old now and as much as i don't want to pay them i figure it's better to get it over with now and not let it remain on my credit i was looking to consolidate my debts the hospital bills are sent to different agencies so i want to consolidate it and perhaps lower it i've heard things about that but i don't know how it works i was curious about the process trusted companies i have a max of dollars available p month come on people give me some answers i wish there was something i could do because i was on medicare until i was now and somehow in debt if someone knows some alternatives to actually paying then feel free but right now i'm looking to reduce and simplify my debts first of all a hospital should not have sent your bills to a collection agency unless you haven't attempted to pay any of the bills for a very long time a year is probably pushing the limit but it's not or years contact the hospital and see if you can work with them on a payment plan let them know you can afford to pay mo and see if they will work with you they should especially if they know they'll get payment if not contact the collection agencies and see if they will work with you as well some if not most agencies will not only work with you but may also cut a deal so you won't have to pay the full amount if neither of these options work look into getting a consolidation loan from your bank i would not suggest using a credit counseling agency not only do most require a fee which obviously you can't afford but from someone with contacts in collections i've heard many of them do not follow through properly and actually end up hurting your credit worse and you'll still be getting those harassing letters and calls from the collection agencies if none of that works my last suggestion would be to call back the hospital administrators and give them an ultimatum either they work with you directly on your terms no collection agencies or they won't get anything at all if the st options aren't available then they're not going to get their money anyway right your credit has already been damaged  Student loan Credit card Bond Mortgage Deflation (economics) Publicly funded medicine Taxation in the United States Insurance Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Government debt Life insurance Economy of the United States Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Money Marshall Plan Annuity Economy of Russia Primerica Financial Services Medicare (Canada) Mergers and acquisitions Gold standard FairTax United Kingdom corporation tax Federal Reserve Derivative (finance) Personal finance Trust (Law) USA United States Postal Service Microeconomics Social Security debate (United States) U.S. public debt Corporation Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Child support Bretton Woods system Medicare (United States) Bank Health care in the United States Internet fraud Article One of the United States Constitution Legal tender History of the United States (1918-1945) Surveillance Corporate finance Estoppel Credit score Hyperinflation Tennessee State Constitution The Amazing Race Arthur Laffer Pharmaceutical company Great Depression Schabir Shaik Trial Barrister Mutual fund Debt consolidation National Kidney Foundation Singapore Flat tax Open access Collateralized debt obligation Mensal__o scandal Money supply Plame affair Copyleft Capital accumulation SCO-Linux controversies Hillary Rodham Clinton Fiat money Public transport Financial services Food and Drug Administration Predatory lending Islamic banking Broadband Internet access Campaign finance reform Yield curve Betting (poker) Social Credit Reaganomics Keynesian economics Unemployment benefit Unemployment Canadian and American health care systems compared Appeal 401(k) Economy of El Salvador Euro Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus

how far will a bank negotiate to avoid writing off a credit card debt my mother's friend owes on a credit card and the bank has been charging her percent interest eventually she just refused to pay after months of threats the bank relented and offered her a five year plan to pay off the debt at six percent interest she says that will simply be paying back the bank its percent in the total accrued so far over a longer time plus she can hardly afford the monthly payments her debt is more than years old and she's payed back so far more than twice what she borrowed on the card she offered the bank percent to call the account settled but they scoffed she wonders given that they did finally quit threatening her and made her an offer are they likely to soften further if she holds her ground and prepares for bankruptcy would the bank be likely to accept a counter offer from her of their five year plan on a lesser total amount how much would the bank get if they wrote off the account and sold the debt the bank can't sell the debt they eat it and claim it on their corporate irs tax return as lost income from an uncollected debt and your friend will receive a parallel filing notice in the mail from the irs of this new income to her that she will have to pay taxes on in the year that occurs and the irs will not cut her a deal anywhere close to what the bank will don't let that happen if she's collectible in the eyes of the bank high income producer they will not be easy to deal with if she appears uncollectible for the whole amount the typical industry offer is about of the total in a lump sum their monthly payback offer is generous and certainly better than what the irs will do after she receives the lost debt income statement in summary i suggest she work out a slow payment plan with the bank or maybe a relative or friend to help her come up with of the debt total and make an offer in compromise good luck tell her in the future don't use credit cards to buy things you couldn't otherwise afford ever  Credit card Bond FairTax Mortgage Bank Debt Taxation in the United States United Kingdom corporation tax Social Security (United States) Life insurance Deflation (economics) U.S. public debt Money Annuity Interest Student loan Bretton Woods system Insurance Personal finance Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Microeconomics 401(k) Economy of Russia Mutual fund Flat tax Hyperinflation Capital accumulation Schabir Shaik Trial Inflation Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Short selling Variable universal life insurance Security (finance) Mergers and acquisitions Derivative (finance) Financial services Tom DeLay Tax Estoppel Baccarat Donald Trump History of the United States (1918-1945) Capitalism Legal tender Government debt Wal-Mart Article One of the United States Constitution Social Credit Primerica Financial Services Social Security debate (United States) Temasek Holdings Monetary policy Tax protester Corporation Corporate finance Bank fraud Child support Income trust Citigroup Kent Hovind Finance Octopus card Arthur Laffer Islamic banking Economy of the United States Treasury security Enron Corporation Tariff Retirement plan Knots Landing Trust (Law) USA Gold standard Municipal bond Progressive tax Measures of national income and output Health insurance Collateralized debt obligation Public transport Advance fee fraud GNU General Public License Credit card fraud Betting (poker) Illegal drug trade George W.

can a creditor go after a spouse after they are deceased my dad passed away a few months ago my step mom tells me that creditors are claiming she is responsible for the debt he owed in his name this is in the state of texas they did not jointly go in on these accounts and only my fathers social security number was tied to his credit card he owed k and a k loan for a piano can they really do this thanks for the answers my condolences on the loss of your father from the diverse opinions expressed above it is clear that your step mother needs competent legal advice from an attorney well versed in texas law that said imho the creditors are trying to pull a fast one here to get their money asap instead of waiting for the probate process to pay them from your father's estate if it has sufficient assets to pay them at all from the few facts presented the creditors lent the money to your father not to the couple as a whole why they did this is their business but they should not now be able to change their minds turn back the hands of time and say that we want the wife's signature as well since this hasn't worked out so well for us texas is a community property state this does not mean that all assets are community property merely that all assets acquired after the marriage date are presumed to be community property unless proven otherwise there may be some other restrictions as well my community property experience is n arizona the creditors may be able to convince the court that the funds so lent were used to acquire community property who has the piano and thus should be liabilities of the community as well as the deceased i'd think this would be far from easy regarding the credit card if possible at all gl and see to it that your step mother has quality legal advice my quick review of texas law via google did not yield a simple answer  Mortgage Concurrent estate Marriage Divorce Corporation Bond Credit card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Probate Insurance Plame affair Administration Child support Debt Bankruptcy Capital accumulation Fractional-reserve banking Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Tax Islamic banking Enron Corporation Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Tom DeLay Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Bank fraud United Kingdom corporation tax Citigroup Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Money Trust (Law) non-USA Will (law) Schabir Shaik Trial Bank Donald Trump History of the Jews in England Appeal Allodial title Trusts and estates Deflation (economics) Civil unions in the United Kingdom Domestic partnerships in California Monetary policy Developing countries' debt Bretton Woods system Debt levels and flows George W.

subprime mrrtgages what are subprime mortgages which have been in the news recently first of all a subprime mortgage is by definition any mortgage home loan given to someone with a less than prime credit rating borrowers' credit worthiness is graded just like tests in school are graded and there are several levels from excellent to awful technically then anything below the highest level is considered sub prime the worse your grade the higher the interest rate the lender will charge to lend you money they charge the higher interest rate both to compensate and to protect themselves for accepting you as a higher risk if for instance they can collect higher interest from you up front and later you default on your loan they have made more potential profit up front if the lenders consider you to be a good risk someone who will stick around for as long as it takes and always make your payments or will pay off the loan in full if you sell and move they are willing to accept a lower interest rate because you are going to be paying them for a long long time and they like that option too for purposes of what is going on right now in the marketplace and the media two definitions are most important first there are a lot of variable rate mortgages out there and the interest rate does just that it changes usually it goes up it can go down but it rarely does when the cost of living goes up or interest rates as set by the federal reserve bank go up or when any one of a number of different benchmark indexes change their rates these can change as often as the loan dictates the second definition then is subprime in the context of the grades mentioned above usually people with the worst credit have the highest interest rate loans even in the best of times those are truly the subprime loans that are in question right now for the most part as an example during one of the more recent good stretches someone with prime credit could get a home loan with a rate while a sub prime loan might have been as high as so if you combine the high starting rate with a variable loan and then send the interest rate up chances are good that the people with bad credit aren't going to be able to pay so they default on the loan and lose the house which then becomes property of the lender if too many people default on their loans the bank that issued them goes out of business because it doesn't have enough cash coming in to do its own business also if enough of these foreclosures happen in an area or the interest rates to get a mortgage become too burdensome for the population in that area the prices of homes there drop this causes further problems for the lenders because once again they often lent this money to people that weren't required to pay any meaningful downpayment old fashioned standards used to pretty much require you to pay for of the house up front and borrow that standard went out the window due to competition between lenders so the original price of the house may be equal to the amount the bank lent to buy it and now they are stuck with a house that when sold still won't recover enough money for them to get back what they lent the bank is now upside down because they have a property which isn't worth what they paid for it and if the homeowner is trying to sell it before a foreclosure they are also considered upside down because they aren't going to be able to pay off the loan for the amount the market will bear so then thanks to what the media is now just calling the subprime loan crisis the homeowner loses because they lose a place to live the lender loses because they may well go out of business other potential homeowners lose because everyone who is considering lending money sees more potential risk so they raise their interest rates now fewer people can buy homes so builders have to build less causing people to lose their jobs and so on  Microeconomics Finance Citigroup Derivative (finance) Real estate

credit cards i dont really no anything about credit cards but i need pounds i have a few questions how mnay credit cards can you have when do you pay back the money how much money can you get from a credit card is it essentially like getting a loan i dont really understand where the money is from i mean does it go into your bank acoount so can you go take out the money in cash from your bank account so then if i need couldnt i just get credit cards and get pounds from each of them out how much would i be paying back to each a month do you have to get the cards from different banks i know sounds confusing but im only doing this becuase its to hard trying to find a loan and i really need the money in response to your questions posed on the credit cards i have outlined some thoughts below you can have as many credit cards as you wish however you may find that the more credit cards you hold retaining a balance upon them the less likely it is to obtain further credit cards as the company issuing the credit card may believe that you pose too great a risk in terms of not making your payment credit cards work on the principal that you make a payment each month relating directly to the amount of your borrowings usually however some card issuers are changing of late some have increased the level of repayment whilst some have decreased it for example if you have a balance of on a credit card you will most likely need to make a payment of of that which equals the cause of so many problems with credit cards is that the minimum payment does not really repay the amount outstanding as interest is added this can mean that the balance of will not be after a payment is made but may have only reduced to the amount of money available on a credit card is determined by the card issuer they will make a judgement based on your credit history your salary and overall financial position as to what level of debt you will find sustainable some card issuers allow much greater amounts of credit than others for the same person it is exactly like getting a loan you are borrowing money from the card issuer and in return for promising to repay at least the minimum payment each month the difference is that a loan has a pre determined amount and subsequently a pre determined payment period a credit card does not as it is open ended in terms of the time you take to repay the balance the longer you take to repay the loan the more interest you will pay the money does not go to your bank account normally you could be allocated a card with a credit limit of say this credit limit is the amount of money available to you to borrow you normally use a credit card to make purchases however you can often use the credit card to withdraw cash from a cash machine there are higher costs to accessing cash both in terms of charges for withdrawals and higher interest rates it is not advisable to use a credit card to withdraw cash particularly if you need access to you ought to take specific advice before contemplating borrowings of that amount  Interest Municipal bond Insurance Gold standard Hyperinflation Bank fraud Mutual fund Islamic banking Finance Predatory lending Corporate finance Money supply Economy of India Personal finance Mortgage-backed security 401(k) Economy of Russia Microeconomics Inflation Microcredit Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social Security (United States) Yield curve Schabir Shaik Trial Octopus card Citigroup Economy of Pakistan Tax Arbitrage United Kingdom corporation tax Variable universal life insurance Financial services Automatic teller machine Stock Great Depression Debit card Capitalism Article One of the United States Constitution Tertiary education fees in Australia Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Taxation in the United States Savings and loan association Collateralized debt obligation Fractional-reserve banking Capital accumulation History of the United States (1918-1945) Credit history Euro Credit score Derivative (finance) Credit derivative Primerica Financial Services Slot machine Social Security debate (United States) Islamic economics Certificate of deposit U.S. public debt Minimum wage Futures contract Pound sterling Economy of the United States Federal National Mortgage Association Gross domestic product FairTax Reserve Bank of New Zealand Debt levels and flows Dividend Fiat money Internet fraud Electronic money Credit card fraud Password Free trade Estoppel Keynesian economics Universal life insurance Cheque Law of value

how do i get a bad rating off my credit report i was irresponsible when i was young i allowed two credit cards go to collections i was able to pay it off years ago in full now it's biting me in the rear no big suprise there i've been told by several people whats the point if you can't get off your credit report is there any way to get if off negative items will remain on your record for years from the date of the negative item so in the case of the charge off of your accounts that will be years from the date of last delinquency not from the date you paid it off for example if you went delinquent in and paid it off in it will be removed in you won't be able to get the original creditor charge off off of your report until the years has passed however if there is still the collection account on there you might be able to get it off to do this send a dispute to the credit reporting agency transunion experian equifax requesting verification of the debt there is a good but not guaranteed chance that the collection agency will not verify the debt if they do not verify the debt it will be removed  Credit card Credit score Debt consolidation Bond Mortgage Debt TransUnion Credit repair Student loan United Kingdom corporation tax Financial audit Experian Surveillance Estoppel Plame affair Taxation in the United States Tom DeLay Debt levels and flows Credit rating agency Money Annuity Deflation (economics) FairTax Islamic banking Credit card fraud Craps Bank fraud Poker jargon Bank Internet fraud E-mail spam Commodity markets Child support Article One of the United States Constitution Evan Mecham Corporation Government debt Animal Crossing Divorce Insurance Barbara Boxer Flat tax Economy of Russia Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Betting (poker) Florida Central Voter File Credit history Enron Corporation Identity theft Fair Isaac Corporation Gold standard Life insurance Primerica Financial Services United States Postal Service Blackjack Teen Girl Squad Driver's license Probation officer Interest IP (complexity) Tax protester Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Corporate governance Fiat money Double-entry book-keeping Pok__mon Trading Card Game Union shop Public-key cryptography Octopus card Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Legal tender British national identity card Government of Maryland Derivative (finance) Fractional-reserve banking Cheque Financial services 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Virgin Mobile Universal Serial Bus Credit derivative Billboard Hot 100 Bankruptcy in the United States Brady Bonds Social Credit Paul Martin Health insurance Electronic toll collection Oakland Athletics Toll road RuneScape Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Secretar__a de Inteligencia Credit union Accountancy Babylonian law The Amazing Race Phone sex Numerology

how long does debt stay on a credit report i am helping my best friend clear up her finances and she has many many old collection notices on her credit report that are helping to drag her rating down they are probably years old do these ever fall off or get written off it seems like they just keep transferring them to other agencies she also has a household bank credit card in collections should this be paid first or the old debt she tried to make arrangements with the collection agency for household but they wanted much more a month than she could give them and they refused to make arrangements so right now they are getting nothing help i am not sure where to start negative items remain on your credit report for years from the date of the negative item so if the account was charged off it will remain on the report for years from the date of the last delinquency missed payment it does not mean the debt goes away it just means that the creditors can no longer report it to the credit reporting agencies transunion experian equifax creditors and collection agencies can not re age a debt so it does not matter how many times they transfer it the date that matters is the original delinquency date if she has debts that are more than years she needs to send a dispute to the cra's to have it removed now there is another item called the legal statute of limitations this is a point after which they can no longer force you to pay by filing a suit against you this is usually years depending on the state you live in so if she has them in the year range there is a good chance they are outside of the sol and can not take any legal actions the link below gives you a break down by state if she does want to pay them off only communicate through the mail never negociate over the phone have her send her offer with what she can pay each month also include that once she pays it off that they remove the collection account do not send any money to them until they have an agreement in writting from them that they approve  Bond Credit card Credit score United States Postal Service Mortgage Annuity Debt Credit repair Student loan Taxation in the United States Legal tender Article One of the United States Constitution Bankruptcy Deflation (economics) Security (finance) TransUnion United Kingdom corporation tax Estoppel Islamic banking Social Security (United States) Surveillance Euro Appeal Money Poker jargon Contract Plame affair Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Interest Insurance Bank Debt consolidation Tom DeLay Derivative (finance) Schabir Shaik Trial Child support Trust (Law) USA Government debt Internet fraud Microeconomics Identity theft Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Economy of the United States Cheque Financial audit Octopus card FairTax Advance fee fraud Debt levels and flows Mail fraud Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Divorce Gold standard Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Fractional-reserve banking Economy of Russia Bankruptcy in the United States Public transport Virgin Mobile Gambling Primerica Financial Services Commodity markets Drug test FidoNet Tax Tax protester Experian Data retention Fiat money United States Department of the Treasury Credit derivative Developing countries' debt Capital accumulation Financial services Gross domestic product Life insurance Mail History of the Jews in England Copyright Mensal__o scandal Short selling Toll road Cyprus dispute Social Credit Government of Maryland Stock Federal Reserve Personal finance International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict Money supply Economy of Romania

how much does closing a credit account hurt your cc score should i open another account right away ok i applied for a mastercard was told on the phone there was no annual fee after using the card when i got it i saw they tacked on a annual fee after using it almost a year they reduced the fee to for the first year i just called to tell them 'either you honor what i was told on the phone about having no annual fee or i am closing this account' needless to say they let me close it my question is how much is this going to hurt my credit score should i apply for another no annual fee card right away get all the damage done at once should i even apply for another card i have a visa with a limit an old navy card limit and a victorias secret card i believe limit also thanks closing your credit card account will raise your debt to credit limit ratio which may lower your score marginally you have other lines of credit so the effect on your credit score should be minimal applying for credit will put an inquiry on your credit report which will also lower your score marginally the inquiry will be on your credit report for years but will only affect your score for year and it's effect will lessen over time unless you plan on buying a big ticket item like a car or house in the next year i would say go ahead and apply for the new credit card with no annual fee if you have an annual fee on a credit card and you can get another credit card with no annual fee you are doing the right thing by closing the account the money you will save more than makes up for the fact that you will lower your credit score a tiny bit  Credit card Credit score Mortgage Personal finance Debit card Octopus card Taxation in the United States Microeconomics Student loan Surveillance Monetary policy Auto insurance Mutual fund Identity theft Plame affair Wal-Mart United Kingdom corporation tax Bank SmartRider Insurance MasterCard London Congestion Charge Poker jargon FairTax Donald Trump Futures contract Interest The Amazing Race Money supply Credit card fraud Supply and demand Internet fraud Law of value Draw poker 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Estoppel Minimum wage Sears Holdings Corporation Mergers and acquisitions Neopets Capitalism Corporation Deflation (economics) Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Antenna (radio) Smart card Public transport Bank of America Social Security debate (United States) Inflation Prisoner's dilemma Keynesian economics Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Schabir Shaik Trial Discover Card EFTPOS Winning Streak United States House of Representatives Consensus decision-making Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Credit history Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Virgin Mobile Supply-side economics E-ZPass Bond Tom DeLay Short selling Temasek Holdings Social Security (United States) Margin (finance) National Certificate of Educational Achievement Capital accumulation H-1B visa $ale of the Century Stored-value card Craps GunBound Education in the People's Republic of China Confidence trick United Airlines Flight 93 National Kidney Foundation Singapore Animal Crossing Jean Charles de Menezes National Football League Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Primerica Financial Services Financial services Annuity Have I Got News For You Heather Wilson Australian legislative election, 2004 Economy of Russia Predatory lending Citigroup International League Risk management

how to repair damaged credit my best friend is going through a painful divorce and has herself in a real financial dilemma i am not sure what to suggest to her it is a long story so i won't go into the particulars but she was left with a mountain of debt she is feeling overwhelmed and frankly so am i we pulled her credit report off of a website and it was so low i am concerned for her it was less than most of what was on her report is anywhere from years old neither one of them were financially responsible and she has a lot of old collection notices from utilities medical bills credit cards she does not want to file bankruptcy but we are trying to come up with a plan to try and fix her credit she can't get a car cell phone or even a credit card in her name she only makes a year and has probably in debt i am not sure how to help her we are going to get her a secured card to get started rebuilding her credit she tried a debt consolidation place a few years back with her husband and the monthly payment was too high for them and the consolidation company couldn't get it any lower because they only have i think or years to pay back i think the payment was a month any ideas to beat the system and get these small collection notices off of her report the average collection notice is probably but she has over of them it is hard to keep them all straight fyi she does not have any equity ie a home to be able to refinance she makes about a year and doesn't even have much leftover at the end of the month the best weapon to fight small collection items is debt validation you need to write out a form letter and send it out to all the creditors certified mail requesting a debt validation if they cannot validate the debt to the penny they must remove it i am attaching a link that gives step by step how to do this the right way http www creditinfocenter com rebuild debt validation shtml ok so if they do validate the debt the sol is probably up on these items because you say they are years old obviously this depends on where you live and what kind of debt it is but lets assume the sol is up you can negotiate credit rating and a lower payment on these debts when setteling with the creditor here are more links the st is on the sol for debts the second is for negotiating your credit rating when setteling debts http www creditinfocenter com rebuild statutelimitations shtml http www creditinfocenter com debt neg rating after settle shtml thirdly she should follow this advice about how to pay creditors when setteling debt ie never use your bank account or disclose where you work it makes it easier to obtain a judgment against you always get the settlement in writing you don't want them coming back after her in years for the remainder of the debt http www creditinfocenter com debt cancreditorsue settlementdifferences shtml your friend is lucky to have a friend who is willing to help her work thru this it will take time i would say give it a year but she should be able to make it thru this good luck  Credit card Bond Debt Credit repair Credit score Mortgage Microeconomics Deflation (economics) Insurance Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Government debt Bankruptcy United Kingdom corporation tax Social Security (United States) Annuity Phishing Estoppel Capital accumulation Appeal Derivative (finance) Student loan Surveillance Gold standard Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economy of Russia Money Bretton Woods system Internet fraud Financial audit Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act FairTax Debt consolidation Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Article One of the United States Constitution Taxation in the United States Keynesian economics Islamic banking Personal finance World Wide Web Interest Debt levels and flows Finance British national identity card Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Bank fraud Donald Trump Security (finance) Identity theft Bank Commodity markets Poker jargon Knife Schabir Shaik Trial Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Hong Kong Monetary Authority Data retention Cheque Social Security debate (United States) Advance fee fraud Economy of the United States Legal tender Primerica Financial Services Enron Corporation Inflation Bankruptcy in the United States GSM services Arthur Laffer Great Depression Corporation Gmail Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Winning Streak Economy of Nigeria Electronic commerce Extreme Programming EastEnders Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Financial services Domain Name System Arbitrage Auto insurance United States Postal Service Mutual fund Cross site scripting Mortgage-backed security Plame affair SCO-Linux controversies Timeline of the Enron scandal Collateralized debt obligation Social Credit Public transport Seventh Sea (collectible card game)

can you eliminate credit card debt by declaring bankruptcy can an individual eliminate credit card debt by declaring bankruptcy i didn't think you could wipe it out just get the bill collectors off your back but someone told me that it depends on which chapter of bankruptcy you use the right one will eliminate credit card debt i know someone who has in credit card debt and they are trying to do that to get rid of that debt is it really possible are there any restrictions in doing this can you ever get a credit card again if you do it if you file bankruptcy to eliminate all debt do you have to give up all of your possessions will you have anything left this is for a friend of mine really they don't own a home they have cars and some furniture and a k plan between the two of them they make about a year i don't see how debt consolidation will help them how could they ever pay off they had a house but they used up all the equity in it over the years and sold it recently and broke even on the deal ending up with nothing what a mess i just didn't think they could wipe out their credit card debt and it really isn't fair to the rest of us that pay our bills there are a number of factors involved a chapter is where you have to pay back some of the debt how much depends on what your current disposable income is and how much your debts total there is a fairly complicate formula involved but this will stop them from filing judgments garnishments or liens it freezes interest and late fees and it protect your property if you own a home or car a chapter is called liquidation for a reason you may have to give up most of your property therefore if you have a lot of property along with that k in credit card debts you may have trouble keeping it all also you must pass a means test this was put into place to prevent someone who has a very good job from filing bk and dodging their debts if you earn generally over k a year you will not qualify for chapter again there is a complicated formula to figure this out there are a lot of bankruptcy lawyers who have a free consultation if you think it's necessary talk your situation over with them  Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Bond Mortgage Credit score Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code Donald Trump United Kingdom corporation tax Bankruptcy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Debt Bankruptcy in the United States Insurance Economy of Russia Deflation (economics) Public domain Capitalism Article One of the United States Constitution Estoppel Poker jargon Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code Security (finance) Property (ownership right) Predatory lending Debt consolidation Microeconomics Tom DeLay Social Security (United States) Interest Pitaten Divorce Social rule Gold standard Taxation in the United States Tennessee State Constitution Credit repair Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Government debt Intellectual property U.S. public debt EastEnders Enron Corporation Allodial title Dot-com Asbestos Knots Landing FairTax Tax Indianapolis 500 Real estate bubble 2000 Australian Grand Prix Assignment (law) Ocean's Twelve Baseball Inflation Copyright Contract bridge Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Capital accumulation Citigroup Surveillance Cable television Plame affair Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Barrister Sheepshead Karl Rove Financial services Sears Holdings Corporation Playoff History of the United States (1918-1945) Trust (Law) USA Copyright law of the United Kingdom James T.

should i close my orchard bank credit cards sadly i have an orchard bank visa and an orchard bank mastercard i've had one of them for about years and the other for about instead of giving credit limit increases they give you another card presumably in the hope that you will get more confused and miss payments and pay their fees they both have limits haha sad the good news is i guess i've been doing something right because i have recently been approved for a cc with a much lower apr and a limit yay my question is should i close the ob ccs they both have annual fees of and they don't really contribute much to my available credit the only reason i would want to keep them open is because they contribute to my history my payment history has been spotless how much would it really hurt my score to close these cards should i just keep them open indefinitely and pay the annual fees grips lol i wonder if that guy in india actually felt he was doing you a favor by increasing your limit by bucks good grief those cards aren't going to help your credit score as much as your new card with the limit why should you pay per year for those other cards that you probably aren't going to use anyway those cards should stay on your credit history for some time anyway even if they are no longer active  Credit card Debit card Credit card fraud Poker jargon Octopus card H-1B visa Sears Holdings Corporation Bank Surveillance MasterCard Identity theft HSBC Mutual fund Immigration to the United States EFTPOS Mortgage Legal tender Bond Taxation in the United States Advance fee fraud Credit score Citigroup Social Security (United States) Auto insurance Minimum wage Deflation (economics) Credit history Money Donald Trump Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Annuity Personal finance Visa (document) Education in the United States Economy of Russia Bretton Woods system Internet fraud Health insurance Phishing Taxation in the Republic of Ireland National Insurance Economy of Africa Kyoto Protocol Have I Got News For You Corporation 401(k) Interest Micropayment Copyleft Monetary policy Toronto-Dominion Bank The Cure Bank of America American Express Game show Mercantilism Bank of China (Hong Kong) Baccarat $ale of the Century The Amazing Race Primerica Financial Services Password Hiberno-English Major League Baseball television contracts E-ZPass Gold standard Chip and PIN Electronic money Public good Social rule Free trade Scrip Life insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Unemployment benefit Social Credit Euro Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 United Kingdom corporation tax Betting (poker) Cleveland Browns Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Arthur Laffer Refinancing Whose Line Is It Anyway?

statutory demand bankruptcy action i hav been issued a statutory demand by normal post not recorded or deliviered in person this was on the the demand for bankruptcy is for a unsecured debt of k my total debts to all creditors of k i jointly own a property with by a person not finacially linked with the debt and it has around k equity in it does the lender pursuing the claim hav to serve the notice in person or by recorded post can bankruptcy be enforced by lender can lender force the sale of the house even tho its in joint names are they likely to pursue this knowin they will make a loss as all lenders wud hav to be paid from procedes wen bankruptcy petiton is presented will my assets be frozen immediately and how long will the process take early settlement of mortgage wud cause a redemption fee of around k wud that be stopped to release more funds for lenders i recieved a letter today dated stating that as i have failed to respond to the statutory demand the collection agent is now in a position to present a bankruptcy petition are the collection agency still trying to bargain as i have not contacted them after the initial threat or is this normal for them to inform as such shud they not be carrying out the threat instead of still warning me just been reading the actual statutory demand form they sent me and the section which indicates the appropriate court they have written your local county court or combined court any application by you to set aside this demand should be made to that court under that they've written for confirmation of your relevant court or if you believe you have grounds to set aside this demand and would like some advice please contact our office on is this normal as this seems very unprofessional and very much a ruse to get me to phone surely on such an official document they have to name my court properly hi thanks for all the advice since i asked i've been researching the company and spoke to a few people on debt forums legally the stat demand has to be delivered to the person not to the address even so it is intriguing to see that this is a popular scare tactic amongst these agencies the form is simple downloaded of the net and issued usually this is enough to scare the lender into paying up at least somethin if a debt firm prints off say and sends them out its gonna get a few hits so to say anyway anyone interested in how this turns out feel free to email me and i'll keep you informed ooops forgot to say it begs the question why not follow the normal route and go for a ccj first then charge order etc why the answer this costs nothing and would usually manage to bully people into paying money they don't have and can't afford you should really get a free first consultation with a solicitor as there are lots of twists and turns basically your petitioning creditor is owed an unsecured debt he only needs to prove that the statutory demand was sent to your last known personal address bankruptcy can be enforced by one lender this puts him in pole position once they have made you bankrupt the official receiver takes over he will repossess your house take his fees from the resultant cheap auction then your number one creditor and anything left to the others immediately you are declared bankrupt all your accounts are frozen trying to move assets to avoid them being taken by receiver is evasion and they will be taken anyway far better you see your lender and try to work something out however hard that might seem  Appeal Plame affair Debt Bankruptcy SCO-Linux controversies Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bank Corporation Internet fraud Insurance Divorce Taxation in the United States Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Enron Corporation Microeconomics Security (finance) Deflation (economics) Estoppel United States Postal Service Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act E-mail spam Child support Bankruptcy in the United States Contract Article One of the United States Constitution Corporate governance Copyright Public domain Donald Trump Monetary policy Advance fee fraud Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Privatization Legal system of Hong Kong Mutual fund Trust (Law) USA Predatory lending Foreclosure Credit card Tennessee State Constitution Fractional-reserve banking FairTax Interest United Kingdom corporation tax Surveillance Government of France Enterprise content management Stock Schapelle Corby President of Ireland Timeline of the Enron scandal Short selling Notary public Gold standard Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v.

is fico partially to determine if you are a good customer aside from creditworthiness i have a suspicion that fico scores were designed not only to determine creditworthiness but to determine if you are a good customer that the credit card company will make money on in my example i have a history of opening cards using them once and cancelling them i do this to get off something or frequent flyer miles or other freebies my credit report is the size of a small novel a lot of times i do it to the same credit card company more than once however in the past decade i have never had a late payment or adverse report my credit report is the size of a russian novel but everything is clean my debt ratios are low because of this my credit score will probably never be above the mid s which isn't bad enough to make me stop my behavior but it pisses me off that i'm being dinged for stuff that has nothing to do with creditworhiness one factor is length of credit that is the longer you have credit lines open the better it looks for your score once you close a card out it no longer becomes a factor in your length of credit history so if you open a card use it once and close it you will have a very short credit age that is in scoring you are being treated like people who have only had an account open for a couple of months rather than a couple of decades it has nothing to do with if you are making them money or not if these cards do not have an anuual fee then there is no harm in keeping them open if you use them and just pay them off every month you still are not paying any extra in terms of interest or fees and it would help your score even more the mid 's are good and you are in a pretty good position to get the top rates available from the myfico com site here are the breakdowns in percentage of the population for each score to  Credit score Credit card Insurance Mortgage Bank Student loan Credit history Yield curve Mutual fund Bond Poker jargon Arbitrage United Kingdom corporation tax Blackjack Predatory lending Internet fraud Deflation (economics) Microeconomics Futures contract Economy of Russia Short selling Credit rating agency Credit card fraud Life insurance Divorce FairTax Monetary policy Financial services Social Security (United States) PE ratio Currency EFTPOS Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Betting (poker) Corporate finance Floppy disk Micropayment Annuity Credit repair America Online Inflation Bretton Woods system Capital accumulation Interest Islamic banking Taxation in the United States Sea level rise Neopets Citigroup Gold standard Gambling Primerica Financial Services Frequent flyer program Social Security debate (United States) Prisoner's dilemma Derivative (finance) Economy of Pakistan Government debt Dog agility Personal finance Intelligence quotient Schabir Shaik Trial Normal distribution Public good Loyalty program Public-key cryptography Contract bridge Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Unemployment Estoppel Auto insurance Extreme Programming Famine Wal-Mart Norway national football team Phishing Tesco Gross domestic product Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code Dorama Capitalism Credit default swap Fast bowling United Airlines Gas metal arc welding History of the United States (1918-1945) Public transport Euro BC Rail Supply and demand Cable television Baseball Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Northwest Airlines

minimum credit limit so i've read that some credit cards have a minimum credit limit that they issue when you are approved generally i think it is the cards for bad credit that specify these minimum limits would anyone happen to know what the minimum credit limit given by chase is hmm i guess i need to rephrase has anyone been approved for a chase card recently how much is the credit limit they gave you how would you rate your credit standing based on your credit score obviously i know that everyone doesn't have the same credit line what i'm asking is if chase has a minimum credit line that they grant to people who open accounts the way that the sub prime cards say that their opening credit line is at least and since i expect that this figure is probably unknown in the case of chase cards i will settle for some sort of idea as to what kind of opening credit line they grant which is why aside from asking if anyone has opened an account recently i am also asking for the credit profile of the person to see if there are similarities in our situation while i know i can't draw any definite conclusions from this data i'm satisfied with having some idea any idea thanks i have a chase card and my limit is how does that help you but i think i understand your question so i'll take a stab at it bad credit credit cards tend to have lower limits usually starting at around some are orchard bank mastercard centenial mastercard first premier and tribute to name just a few they tend to start with a limit they charge you up fromt fees and activation fees and when you get the card you usually have an available balance of around half what you started with if you are lucky they will charge you in the neighborhood of year in fees and the rate is to the moon now chase i don't believe markets to that demographic i'm not trying to sound like a snob btw but i could be wrong i'm guessing that a chase card would start at around for the lower limit again i don't have any independant knowledge of this but i have looked at a ton of credit reports and don't recall seeing a lower limit on a chase card  Credit card Student loan Minimum wage Debit card Poker jargon Bank fraud Octopus card Theory of conduct MasterCard Password United Kingdom corporation tax Monetary policy Supreme Court of the United States GED Citigroup Game show Whose Line Is It Anyway?

why do 'they' imprison people who owe money if they're in jail prison how are they going to pay then people what about people who don't pay their parking tickets and other fines i've seen them go i've also seen bad check writers go i saw someone go for failing to pay child support i'm sure i'll think of more assuming you live in the usa and you are referencing the usa there are no debtor's prisons in the usa and a debtor can file bankruptcy it is in our own constitution we also allow people who have serious debt to hold professional licenses and political office unlike other countries and we are probably more debt tolerant than other countries with that being said a bill collector calling up and harassing you at home and work and all of the hurdles of filing bankruptcy now a debtor may actually feel like he is in prison a debtor can write the bill collectors by certified mail and stop the calling although they can't stop the bills from coming in or and does not stop the interest rate from accruing on the original debt if the bill collector continues to call and the debtor can document the calls the debtor then has rights against the creditor and should find a lawyer or a debtor can go bankrupt or to consumer counseling or make an offer in compromise or wherever at the same time a creditor can sue the debtor can garnish up to a certain portion of a debtor's wages in some states not all and that portion varies by state still not all of the wages can be garnished and a debtor's nonexempt property can be seized by a credtior to satisfy a debt usually in most states a judgment has to be finalized before a debtor's property can be seized for most instances a bill collector or a creditor is also limited by what they can seize property wise from a debtor but still a debtor will not go to jail for not paying the debt if any bill collector threatens jail document it and run to a lawyer immediately a bill collector can never threaten jail prison let's talk about the types of debts you mentioned and why they go to jail children are entitled to be supported by both parents children are especially protected by law and by the government if they cannot be supported by their parents the government will subsidize an entitlement to assist you don't want your children starving on the streets and neither does the government both parents have an obligation to support their children if a parent cannot support his child he or she has to explain why to a court at some point this is a type of debt that never goes away except possibly after the statute of limitations has passed after the child is grown also if the government subsidizes an entitlement they are entitled to get their money back if a parent is truly unable to pay their court ordered or agreed on child support for whatever reason perhaps they are incapacitated or for whatever reason they will not go to jail but it is up to that parent who is not paying to go to court and prove they cannot pay and that paying would put them out on the street or let them die since they can't afford their lifesaving medicine most people go to jail for nonpayment of child support due to the fact that they ignore the problem fail to go to court to prove the amounts have to be lowered or prove they can't pay and so the problem gets worse they move off they work under the table try to justify or rationalize why they aren't going to court to do the right thing but eventually the world catches up to them not dealing with the problem of not being able to pay and just running away is why most of the people who do not pay go to jail or they go to jail since they chose to ignore the requirement to pay for whatever reason such as they harbor resentment against the other parent and rather than deal with the issue they ignore it and wind up in jail if someone can't pay their child support they need to find a lawyer or represent themselves and return to court to explain why parking fines many parking fines occur for parking in a handicapped spot parking in a fire zone or some place like that they are specially marked zones for other's safety that you can't park in in many of these states this would be a class c misdeameanor which is a criminal charge lke most tickets are in most states class c misdemeanors are usually punished by fine only not by jail the us supreme court has ruled that a person who can't pay a fine for these types of crimes since they are truly unable to pay will not go to jail but they have to prove to the court that they cannot pay some places even have volunteer work or community service to work off such fines and if you can't pay this is one way to work it off some places actually also rather than deal with the hassle of someone not paying will offer jail to the offender credit equal to a set amount where i live it is dollars a day to offset the fine but if you can't truly pay and you can prove it even after a few resets by the court that you still can't pay and if there is no way to work off the fine you will not go to jail unless you do it voluntarily just to be done with the fine where most people get into trouble is that they blow off the parking fine and ignore the court date or shrug it off thinking it is just a fine igorning a court date on a ticket even a parking ticket is always a bad idea and a warrant gets issued eventually the offender gets stopped for something else like running a red light or speeding or whatever and the warrant is there on the cop's computer and you go to jail for a parking ticket or any other type of fine that you ignored or perhaps they forgot about it or got scared since they forgot about it or got scared that they didn't have the money and just didn't go to court to explain why they didn't pay and some cities will send out periodically someone to execute on their parking and traffice ticket warrants where people ignored the ticket and the court date irs debts no the irs will not put you into jail for non payment if you truly can't pay if they think you can pay some and you ignore them they may execute on your nonexempt property or money and use the funds to satisfy their debt where people get into trouble here is they owe and they get scared and so they stop filling their returns which is a crime or they lie to the irs bad thing is to lie to any governmental entity if you can't discuss the issue or need to exercise your right to remain silent get a lawyer or request a lawyer but never never lie to the government the irs will work out a repayment plan or a foregiveness plan or a percentage plan or an offer in compromise and many many debts have statute of limitations running that may bar collections for the debt but if you don't file you are in trouble and not filing does not help as to the statute of limitations defense you have to keep in touch with them hot checks it is a crime to intentionally write a hot check for any amount it is called theft the days of trying to float a check until your paycheck is depositied are long gone even walmart will cash a check now on the day it is written some people though can't add and subtract a checkbook or their checks gets stolen or whatever and they bounce a check most states require that the creditor on a hot check send out a notice in some states this notice does not have to be by certified mail to the address on the check if you have moved it is up to you to change your checks and your bank address it is up to you to insure your account is closed if you close it out it is up to you to pick up the certified mail the bank sends out notices when a check bounces many times before the creditor knows your check bounced you know when your checks bounce you get bank statements also that show when a check bounces that notice is to give you time to make the check good in case it was an overight on your part and even then many prosecutors of hot checks will send out yet another notice to give you time once they get the check from the creditor to pay before they pursue charges it never a good idea to ignore those notice letters since most credtors and proseuctor's offices just want the money and will work out a payment plan if you do it now if you break the payment plan well you maybe in trouble since you never should have written the check anyway some people write the check for food or emergency medical services but this is still theft you can get food or foof stamps if you are truly broke and you hospitals have to treat you for emergencies if you are broke so really debts is not the reason the people you referenced are imprisoned most go to jail for ignoring the problem ignoring their obligations or intentionally blowing the problem off short of severe mental illness there are very few reasons to justifiy blowing these situations off being scared is not an excuse either igoring the certified mail or failing to pick up the certified mail is not a good idea either since once the letter is sent by certified mail that is usually enough for the other end to prove they gave you notice and in many places a notice does not require certified mail just simple mail is enough it may seem like they are going to prison for being unable to pay but in actuality they are not not dealing with obligations or problems is the reason why they go to jail you will never go to jail for being broke if you are truly unable to pay and it is choice between paying the parking ticket and you living on the street or paying the irs or child support or you getting the prescription you need to stay alive you will not go to jail but be prepared to prove you are that broke igoring the problem doesn't work

i just looked at my credit report the hospital claimed that i owed them money but never really sent me a bill they were also told the truth don't bill me because my mom is responsible for my bills i see that they have put a mark on my credit i want to dispute this i wrote the ftc and filed a complaint against them is it possible to get this taken off my credit how do i find out my credit score for free this is driving me crazy does the majority of the public have a perfect score or what is the normal score i don't just want a free report i want the score i was when this went on if you were over when the services were rendered you are responsible for the medical bills regardless of what you and your mother told the hospital if you were under then it should be removed because you were not of age to contract and your mother would be responsible the best way to handle this is to write to each of the three major bureaus trans union experian and equifax disputing the debt as not mine if you were under i would include proof of your age at the time services were rendered if it shows you were a minor now if you were over you could dispute the date of services the amount owed or any other factors that may be inaccurate the hospital has days to verify the information as accurate i have to tell you that this is probably an uphill battle for you because if the information is accurate nobody can legitimately have it removed as for most people's scores i have never seen a perfect score an average score is in the mid to high six hundreds credit bureaus have to give you a free credit report every year but can charge you for your scores also those credit reports that include all three bureaus may give you a score but they are never accurate the system has really turned ino a major rip off anyway that's pretty much what you can expect sorry i couldnt give you more info  Credit score TransUnion Credit card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Killian documents Plame affair SCO-Linux controversies Credit repair E-mail spam Insurance EastEnders Publicly funded medicine Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Tom DeLay Bond United States Postal Service Medical malpractice Days of our Lives Contract bridge Surveillance National Health Service Stopping e-mail abuse Cheating in Counter-Strike Mumia Abu-Jamal Taxation in the United States SAT Microeconomics Child support Intelligence quotient Slander and libel ELO rating system Internet fraud British national identity card Kurt Cobain Medicare (Canada) United Kingdom corporation tax SCO v.

for every collection i pay off how many points does my credit score go up and how long does it take thanks everyone wow crappy answers again hnm what the heck you talking about this is the same idiotic mindmuck that dave ramsey sells you copy that from his site the answer if you do it wrong it will actually hurt your score by paying off collection debts pull up a chair and let me explain for starters once you have paid off a collection debt all the creditor is required to do is show paid on your credit report but all notations about late fees charge off's and collections will still be there it will still be listed as a negative item on your credit report and it will still hurt your score now the worse part debts that are placed on your credit report hurt you bad but as time goes by their effect does down after years most creditors do not pay that much interest they are more worried about seeing recent negative activity on your report so lets say you pay off the collector and he now shows your debt as paid but you still have all those bad marks what has happened is this entry turns your listing into recent activity and turns your old forgotten debt into a new one killing your score what you have to do is get an agreement with the creditor in writing to delete the entry once you have paid it once removed it will immediately improve your credit score creditors are going to tell you they can't do it or that it's illegal trust me i've researched this and i have helped many people do this there is no law preventing a creditor from deleting their own item from your credit report there is nothing in the credit bureau's user agreement preventing it i've read it not there the only reason they would refuse is because they want to continue to punish you for your past debt problems why on earth would you want to pay a debt and still have it hurt your credit that's silly so insist that they either delete the item or don't pay them a dime  Deflation (economics) Credit repair Theory of conduct Credit card Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Debt Windows XP Plame affair Neopets Estoppel Bond Islamic banking Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Taxation in the United States GNU General Public License Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Credit score Social Security (United States) Socrates Trust (Law) USA Surveillance Tennessee State Constitution Utilitarianism Intellectual property Legal tender Annuity Usury Developing countries' debt Tom DeLay Spyware Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Student loan United Kingdom corporation tax Internet fraud Bankruptcy in the United States Corporate governance CPU cache MMORPG Article One of the United States Constitution Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Marcus Licinius Crassus Babe Ruth Copyleft Contract London Congestion Charge Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Babylonian law The Star Wars Holiday Special Scientology beliefs and practices Short selling Microeconomics Gold standard Money Los Angeles Kings Insurance History of the Jews in England Trusted computing Copyright Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Inflation Unemployment Bank Magna Carta Social rule Arguments for and against drug prohibition Public domain Intelligence quotient Live 8 New York Knicks Avenue Q Dave Ramsey SCO-Linux controversies Mergers and acquisitions Optimization (computer science) Schabir Shaik Trial Public-key cryptography Rape Ludwig Wittgenstein Ra (board game) Famine Enron Corporation Animal Crossing Guns N' Roses Interest Citigroup

how do credit cards work i want to know how a credit cards work i'm only years old but i just want to know how they work and i want to know how a debit cards work too hello roxy credit cards can be useful if you know how to play the game basically once you get a job and want to buy something on credit you fill out your st application use a cheat sheet with your info handy so all applications will show the same info the company extending you credit will want to see at least a month employment history at the same workplace etc so the st place you apply at is a fun clothing store and they give you a credit limit you might think wow time to shop sorry you need to buy items a max of and pay them off when the bill comes in no minimum payments of because if you don't pay off the full amount due you will be charged interest sometimes you do the math now your cool clothing is costing you more than you would have paid if you had just bought it with cash so now you're thinking you don't want to have credit cards and pay interest the key is to pay off the entire balance due every month if you do that they can't charge you interest and you get the benefit of building your credit the adult world revolves around your credit score you can't get a car or an apartment without a good one your credit score is based upon your payment history and the amount of money various creditors are willing to extend to you ok so you want to build your credit history properly after months of buying items from the fun clothing store and paying them off each month you call the fun clothing store and ask for a credit line increase you want available credit instead of they look at your payment history and usually grant your request anxious to charge you for interest which you will not be paying because you pay off your purchases each month in full so things are going well but you'd like to buy other things from other stores you need a big name credit card like a visa or mastercard you apply to them listing the fun clothing store as a creditor they check your payment history and now you've got a credit card that can be used virtually anywhere after months you ask for an increase in your credit limit and so on eventually creditors will send you offers on lesser interest rates and bonus incentives to use their card or when you want your st car you can wait until they offer interest oac on approved credit extended only to those with stellar credit reports now that you have a stellar credit history you can toss any credit offers that charge a yearly fee or a higher rate debit cards just take the money directly out of your bank account as if you were paying by cash this doesn't help you build your good credit report and there are often fees associated with each transaction ewww i hope i explained that well enough have a great day susan  Octopus card Debit card Internet fraud Life insurance Mortgage Annuity Insurance EFTPOS Bond Auto insurance Student loan Surveillance Personal finance Debt Slot machine Credit card fraud Taxation in the United States Monetary policy MMORPG Tax Citigroup Primerica Financial Services Food Stamp Program Wal-Mart Islamic banking Poker jargon Electronic commerce Neopets Electronic money $ale of the Century FairTax Wheel of Fortune Corporation 401(k) Best Buy Arbitrage Bank fraud Social Security (United States) Double-entry book-keeping Money supply United Kingdom corporation tax Financial audit MetroCard Interest Filling station Stock Gold standard Mergers and acquisitions Gross domestic product Cheque Deflation (economics) Schabir Shaik Trial Craps Smart card Capitalism Toll road Economy of Russia Legal tender Betting (poker) Minimum wage Inflation Bretton Woods system MapleStory Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Oyster card Great Depression Online shop Social Credit United States Postal Service Advance fee fraud Identity theft Salary cap Corporate finance RFID Sears Holdings Corporation Estoppel Virgin Mobile Blackjack Immigration to the United States Variable universal life insurance Accountancy Driver's license Capital accumulation Enron Corporation Security (finance) Financial services Flat tax Anarchism and capitalism

do i have to accept a credit card i applied for i applied to transfer my balance to a lower int rate card i received the card but the limit was not enough to cover the cards i want to transfer now what indeed balance transfer saves a lot of money and can save things from going worse but many people simply don't know the right way to do balance transfer this article takes a look at the correct process to initiate and complete the balance transfer the first thing to look out when a person wants to transfer his balances is a credit card which offers the lowest apr rates and lowest balance transfer fees many online credit card companies offer credit card comparisons it is indeed a good practice to search for the credit cards using their services and decide on a credit card which offers the maximum savings it is important to note here that balance transfer aprs depend on a person's credit history if the credit card in question offers the lowest rates it is definitely for those with the best credit ratings there are different balance transfer apr's for people with lower credit ratings so it becomes imperative that one chooses the credit card which offers the lowest apr and balance transfer fees for his credit ratings when you decide for a balance transfer it doesn't mean that your obligation for payments towards your outstanding balances with the existing credit card company cease to exist you will have to pay the credit card company all the monthly payments one way you can save money is to just send the monthly minimum payments to the existing credit card company this way you won't default and invite penalty read more from http www credit card gallery com article the right way to credit card balance transfers  Credit card Refinancing Mortgage Octopus card Insurance Bank Annuity Credit card fraud Internet fraud Credit score Interest 401(k) Taxation in the United States Money Betting (poker) Bank fraud Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Microeconomics Personal finance Surveillance United Kingdom corporation tax Minimum wage FairTax Capitalism Keynesian economics Blackjack Theory of conduct Debt Copyleft Baccarat Economy of Russia Annual percentage rate Online shop United States Postal Service Credit history Life insurance Government debt Redundant array of independent disks Predatory lending EFTPOS Electronic commerce Contract Password Mail fraud Gross domestic product Hearts (game) Economy of India Health insurance Instant-runoff voting Auto insurance Poker jargon Security (finance) Secure Digital card Virgin Mobile Jeopardy!

credit card issuer cancel my card due to inactivity of the card use will this impacts my credit score i got notification from credit card issuer that my credit card was canceled due to inactivity i have not use the card for more than a year i would like to know if this cacelation will have impact on my credit score thanks the notation that it is closed by the credit granter will not drop your scores but it could be considered as a negative by a credit underwriter in general as far as it being closed it could have be a negative since you would be losing the credit limit that was being reported which could drive up your overall utilization if you do not want the account you might call and request that they show it on your reports as being closed by you if you want the account contact them and request that it be re opened they may or may not change the reporting status or re open it but either way it would be worth it to try if you re open it use it at least once every to months for a small purchase and pay in full when you get the statement so you would not be paying interest  Credit card Bond Financial services Credit score Mortgage Municipal bond Insurance Debit card Estoppel Money HSBC Octopus card Student loan Citigroup Plame affair Credit card fraud Debt FairTax Stored-value card Futures contract Poker jargon Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mortgage-backed security Personal finance Hyperinflation Life insurance Cheque Electronic money Annuity United Kingdom corporation tax Bank fraud Traveler's cheque Short selling Credit history Enron Corporation Driver's license The Amazing Race Bank Identity theft Deflation (economics) Internet fraud Social Security (United States) Texas hold 'em Gmail Betting (poker) Phone sex Indian nationality law Derivative Frequent flyer program Open Directory Project EFTPOS George W.

what is the best way to deal with existing credit cards for newlyweds my wife and i are wondering how we should deal with each of our individual credit accounts for ease of financial management we would like to reduce consolidate credit lines however we understand closing credit lines could adversely impact our credit ratings we don't want to do anything to reduce our individual ratings both of us have credit ratings in the low just another detail my wife and i only use one card each but have a several others our cards are paid off monthly so there is no revolving debt unfortunately you can't have it both ways you can't consolidate close some accounts and not have it affect your credit score but the good news is that it won't affect your score enough to matter with scores in the 's i assume you mean fico scores and not vantagescores your scores would have to drop over points before it would mean anything when applying for credit and closing a couple of accounts won't cause that large of a drop unless they have large credit lines and you choose to keep a card with a small credit line that being said there's no real benefit to closing any cards if you use them a couple times a year it's likely they will keep your accounts active if you don't they may eventually be closed without you taking any action don't forget that if you have cards in good standing that you don't use you can attract some good offers from the issuers to entice you to use them and you can use that to your benefit just last month i got a letter from citibank offering me bonus thank you points if i would charge on a card i don't use before the end of august those points are worth about so i'm going to do it free money right it's your decision but i would recommend keeping all your cards open if you choose to cancel some it's best to keep the cards with the largest credit lines open you have high credit scores and i don't know why you would want to change what you have done that got you there in the first place chances are those open accounts with no usage helped keep your utilization low which is good for your score  Credit card Credit score Microeconomics Contract bridge Bond Blackjack Money FairTax Personal finance Annuity Citigroup United Kingdom corporation tax Debt Hyperinflation Prisoner's dilemma Insurance Mortgage Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Primerica Financial Services Financial services Bank Unemployment Hearts (game) Monetary policy Corporate finance Betting (poker) Mutual fund Euro Life insurance Slot machine Draw poker Economy of Russia Supply and demand Deflation (economics) Schabir Shaik Trial Sydney Riot of 1879 Wheel of Fortune Arbitrage Internet fraud Capitalism Tax Education in the People's Republic of China Economics Password Extreme Programming Baccarat Taxation in the United States Sheepshead Gold standard Surveillance Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Enron Corporation Craps Wal-Mart $ale of the Century Corporate governance Ra (board game) Divorce Keynesian economics Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Labour economics Economic inequality Jeopardy!

what do you think about subprime crisis i saw this coming quite a few years ago there were too many lenders making up too many exotic loan programs where people with not so good credit could lie about their income and get loans with teaser rates rather than qualifing these people first with year fixed and figuring out exactly how much home is affordable many loan officers did not bother to inform their client of the possible ramifications of these exotic loan programs such as the pay option arms where you are given a choice of three monthly payment options month to month many people chose the lower payment which caused negative amortization each month they used that option and now they have a home that is worth less than the pricipal balance of their mortgage now the introductory periods are ending and they have to pay principal and interest on fluctuating rates and are finding they cannot afford the payment and slowly but surely default and wind up being foreclosed on there are many new housing tracts here in california where to percent of the homes are in foreclosure and the few homes that are not the values have gone way down and these people who are making their mortgage payments on time everytime are ending up in the same boat with a home that is less in value with a principal balance higher that what the home is worth it's a dominoe effect basically and it appears to me that the subprime crisis little by little is spilling over into the prime area  Mortgage Government National Mortgage Association Bond Student loan Deflation (economics) Predatory lending Collateralized mortgage obligation Credit card Savings and loan association Debt 401(k) Annuity Bank Economy of Russia Microeconomics Debt consolidation Annual percentage rate Great Depression Federal National Mortgage Association Insurance Consumer finance Personal finance Islamic banking ACORN Money Credit score Bretton Woods system Urban sprawl Real estate bubble FairTax Taxation in the United States Interest rate Municipal bond Economy of Pakistan Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Payday loan Gold standard Real estate broker History of the United States (1918-1945) Primerica Financial Services Microcredit Subsidy Capital accumulation Savings and Loan crisis Refinancing Foreclosure Inflation United Kingdom corporation tax Short selling Monetary policy Islamic economics Government debt Unemployment benefit Donald Trump Futures contract Security (finance) Collateralized debt obligation Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Economy of the United States History of post-Soviet Russia Hyperinflation Finance Unemployment Citigroup Education in the United States Social Security (United States) Option style Flat tax Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Asian financial crisis Economy of Argentina Title insurance Central processing unit Central bank Tennessee State Constitution U.S. public debt Usury Social Security debate (United States) Economic relations of Japan Treasury security Gross domestic product Schabir Shaik Trial Federal Reserve Credit history Lawyer Business cycle International Monetary Fund Yield curve Food Stamp Program Variable universal life insurance Argentine Currency Board Concurrent estate

how do i re built my credit i am years old and have a credit score of is there anything i can do to improve it in order to improve your score it would help to know what makes up your score payment history total debt owed vs available credit length of time establishing credit types of accounts established inquiries and new accounts even though you mentioned your credit score you really didn't go into detail about the kinds of accounts you have and whether or not they're in good standing so it's hard to pinpoint what areas should be worked on in order to improve your score i can give you some basic tips on what you should do to improve your score check your reports for any inaccurate infromation and duspute them with the credit bureaus pay on time like i mentioned earlier payment history makes up if you have trouble paying on time take a look at how you pay it would be to your advantage to open a checking and savings account if you haven't already and take advantage of the online billpay feature if it's offered if not there are services like checkfreeweb that can pay your bills for you for a small fee i posted a link below another thing is on the accounts you have in good standing is that to try to keep the balances on any open credit card accounts under of the available credit for example if you have a limit the balance should be no more than you should have at least open revolving credit cards and installment auto mortgage personal loan sutdent loans furniture or appliance loans for a balanced mixture of credit secured credit cards are easy cards to apply for simply because a deposit is used as collateral to get a credit line the same amount of the deposit usually after a year or more of paying on time and keeping the balance low the card coverts to a regular card and the deposit isn't needed anymore department store cards are also easy to get a suggestion would be to only apply and open one i posted links ot several banks that offer secured credit cards if you have any items in collections make arrangements to pay them off depending on how the accounts in collections are you may be able to settle to get them removed for much less than what you originally owed i posted a link that explains this in much more detail  Credit score Bank Student loan Surveillance Internet fraud Money supply Interest Money Insurance Debt Annuity Octopus card Bank fraud FairTax Security (finance) Identity theft Deflation (economics) Taxation in the United States Debt consolidation Personal finance Poker jargon Debit card Primerica Financial Services Savings and loan association Derivative (finance) Child support Mutual fund Credit history Citigroup Life insurance Plame affair Economy of Russia Mortgage-backed security Short selling Neopets Copyleft Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Advance fee fraud Extreme Programming 401(k) Gross domestic product Electronic money Capital accumulation Automatic teller machine United Kingdom corporation tax EFTPOS Soci__t__ G__n__rale Charles Ponzi Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Microcredit Fiat money Flat tax Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Schabir Shaik Trial Popular, Inc Financial audit Tom DeLay History of the United States (1918-1945) Baccarat Credit card fraud Collateralized debt obligation Great Depression Credit union Predatory lending Refinancing E-ZPass Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Sears Holdings Corporation Commodity markets Unemployment benefit Bretton Woods system Wells Fargo Blackjack Government debt E-mail spam Cheating in Counter-Strike RFID Law of value Payroll Star Trek Customizable Card Game Collateralized mortgage obligation Debt levels and flows Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Certificate of deposit Hong Kong Monetary Authority

can anyone make an argument for the use of credit cards i cannot find one reason people use credit cards instead of just paying cash it appears to me that it is just playing with snakes and even incentive cards have high interest rates and outrageous fees there is no good reason except immediate need gratification the atm visa or mastercard has the same protections as a credit card anything you can do with a credit card you can do with your debit card so you can rent a hotel or whatever and not carry a wad of cash if you pay cash you don't care about a credit score a credit score just means you have debt if you have no credit card bills you probably have money in savings for emergencies all those perks credit cards give are better for them than you visa has one know where if you buy meals from burger king you get a free meal big deal you can get a manually underwritten mortgage without a credit score people who pay with credit cards tend to spend percent more than people who buy with cash if you buy with cash then you probably have a budget so you know exactly where your money is going  Credit card Mortgage Bank Money Debit card Bond EFTPOS Insurance Predatory lending Capitalism Donald Trump Credit card fraud FairTax Surveillance Personal finance Discover Card Debt Taxation in the United States U.S. public debt VISA (credit card) Life insurance Credit score Smart card Automatic teller machine Internet fraud Security (finance) Inflation Financial services Electronic money Toronto-Dominion Bank Microeconomics Deflation (economics) Gross domestic product Monopoly (game) Anarchism and capitalism Financial markets Primerica Financial Services Octopus card Hyperinflation MasterCard Confidence trick Social Security (United States) Economy of the United States Mergers and acquisitions Interest Derivative (finance) Bretton Woods system Economy of Russia Monetary policy Money supply Wal-Mart Slot machine Reaganomics H-1B visa Mutual fund Capital accumulation Education in the United States Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Bank of America Bank fraud Betting (poker) Flat tax Electronic commerce Mortgage-backed security Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Health insurance Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Privatization Schabir Shaik Trial Arbitrage E-ZPass Scrip Ulster Bank $ale of the Century Keynesian economics Micropayment History of the United States (1918-1945) Publicly funded medicine The Amazing Race Marshall Plan Dividend Contract bridge MetroCard Arthur Laffer Health care in the United States Annuity Debt consolidation Charles Ponzi Futures contract Treasury security Television licence Loyalty program Prostitution in Germany

how do i ask credit card company to reduce interest rate on all my cards i want to reduce and get rid of some of my card and i have very high rate but i pay all billls on time rate as high as you must have a good payment history for them to reduce your interest rate most of the time when interest rates go up that much it signifies a missed or late payment i've heard that if you have at least months of payments made on time then you have a good chance of getting your interest rate reduced if the company still says no then tell them the reason you are asking is b c you received an offer for a reduced rate from another card company also say that you have an established business relationship with your current company that you do not want to terminate however you will be forced to do so if your company refused to at least match the rate of the competitor credit card companies don't want to lose business so they will most likely do anything to keep you  Credit card Insurance Life insurance Bond Bank Deflation (economics) Gold standard Dividend United Kingdom corporation tax Credit card fraud Credit score Debt Interest Unemployment Credit history Donald Trump Student loan Annuity Primerica Financial Services Refinancing Health insurance FairTax Legal tender Electronic commerce Citigroup PE ratio Minimum wage Wachovia American Express World Wrestling Entertainment Income trust Social Security (United States) Poker jargon Municipal bond Surveillance Mortgage Financial services Apple Computer Bretton Woods system Mainframe computer Betting (poker) Corporate finance Islamic banking Personal finance Western Union Collateralized debt obligation Micropayment Debt consolidation Money VISA (credit card) EFTPOS Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Phone sex Monetary policy Taxation in the Republic of Ireland 401(k) Octopus card Leasehold estate Keynesian economics Sears Holdings Corporation Baccarat Finance High-yield debt National Insurance London Congestion Charge Mutual fund Internet fraud Schabir Shaik Trial Capitalism Economy of Russia Mortgage-backed security ATI Technologies The Amazing Race Minitel Blackjack Ponzi scheme Electronic money Natural monopoly Topps Euro Tertiary education fees in Australia Hyperinflation Airline Treasury security Arbitrage Government National Mortgage Association High-definition television Altair 8800 Privatization Microeconomics Certificate of deposit Lehman Brothers Surplus value Deficit spending History of the United States (1918-1945) Fox Broadcasting Company Wal-Mart Centrelink

if you are married how much does your spouse's credit effect yours if nothing is in both names my husband and i just got married in march he has a past history of really bad credit he's not a good money manager he's not good at remembering when things are due and tends to be late on things out of pure forgetfulness i on the other hand have excellent credit i have never been late on anything always pay more than minimum and really handle credit in the way it should be handled i also handle accounts payable receievable for a living so i am accustomed to handleing money how much does it effect my credit if he's late on one of his payments if my name is not on it we don't have both our names on anything not even bank accounts haven't gotten around to a joint one yet does it effect mine at all or since we got married do we have a joint credit score now or what i'm looking to take over our finances since i'm not satisfied with the way he's handleing them its causing major tension i would like to know one way or the other in this arguement thanks btw i married him b c i love him with all of my heart he's not a total bum works hard and provides very well for me he's just not good at tracking this type thing everyone has strengths and weaknesses and you can't pick the parts of a person you love you have to love all of them its kinda difficult right now on us but we will get it figured out in a way thats benficial to both of us also we already own home or i should say he does it's in his name he's done a lot of work on his credit already and qualifying for a home proves that but its still not his fave thing in the world to handle and so thats why i would rather just take care of it all his credit will not directly affect you in any way we all have one credit score and it is attached to our ssn so your info does not merge with his it does affect you in other ways indirectly because he has bad credit and you good does he expect you to provide him with credit cards if he defaults on those cards it would affect you negativly not saying he does or would just considerations to make when it comes time to buy a house or a car if his name is on it with a bad credit score he would probably need you to cosign this in and of itself would not bring down your credit score but the more items you have in your name the more your debt to income ratio is affected and that inturn would affect your credit worthieness so you need to watch that kind of thing the biggie will be when you are ready to buy a house if his credit is poor it could affect your interest rate especially if you need him on the mortgage to buy the house ie because of dti so it is good you are having your accounts separate but it is also important you two put a little time and effort into fixing his poor credit and maintaining your good credit so you will be on equal footing also you say he is really bad at money managment so it might be important to keep separate finances you could have checkings the checking for your paychecks to be direct deposited into the checking for your bills to be paid from and groceries and the checking for your spending money give him access to only the spending money account it is important he doesn't feel you are imasculating him but that you are trying to help him and keep your finances in order as well good luck  Credit card Bank Mortgage FairTax Annuity Debt Credit score Student loan Bond Deflation (economics) Monetary policy Gross domestic product Citigroup Internet fraud Poker jargon Life insurance Money Mutual fund Social Security (United States) Personal finance Islamic banking Cheque Capitalism Derivative (finance) Economy of Russia Gold standard Money supply Fiat money Economy of the United States Divorce Interest Bretton Woods system Fractional-reserve banking Inflation Identity theft Mergers and acquisitions Compensation of employees United Kingdom corporation tax Schabir Shaik Trial Theory of conduct Finance Taxation in the United States Security (finance) Capital accumulation Insurance Publicly funded medicine Equine conformation Hyperinflation Tax Concurrent estate Inventory Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Betting (poker) Electronic commerce Pitaten Great Depression Social rule Surveillance Corporate finance Donald Trump Health insurance The Amazing Race Economic inequality Blackjack U.S. public debt Financial audit Predatory lending Value added tax Craps Economy of Pakistan Unemployment Commodity markets Financial markets Flat tax Contract Leasing Euro Arthur Laffer Supply and demand Financial services Supply-side economics History of the United States (1918-1945) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Tesco Primerica Financial Services Billboard Hot 100 Savings and loan association

repost collection agency withdrew money w o authorization can i get it back now that the debt is paid i'm reposting hopefully it will be less confusing i had a tuition debt go into collections i lost my job and moved to another state i had to keep my out of state bank account open so my previous employer could deposit my severance pay i agreed to pay month the agency debited the on the th of the month for months i received my severance pay in early march i asked the agency if i could make my march payment early and for them not to debit on the th as i'd be opening a new account in a local bank they agreed i was clear not to withdraw on the th they rec'd their payment on the th i opened my new account and transferred all but into it i left in it in case i needed until the funds cleared at my new bank they attempted to debit on the th th th of march i was hit with an insufficient funds fee at attempt when i questioned them about it they demanded the full amount i paid this debt in full could i get my back my bank wouldn't help me just gave a form to fill out ya know they agreed not to withdraw on that date they got that months payment they wouldn't accept anything but auto payments no checks money orders etc i still have the statement i want to call them everyday and give them the this is an attempt to collect a debt any information obtained will be used for that purpose line it's the principle of it after i paid the debt in full i sent a letter to the school which i originally got my degree from i explained the situation to them and they sided with me and removed all evidence of this debt from my credit report i just want revenge and badly i really don't care about the money it would be worth the entertainment okay this is a bit more clear as to what you did it will still come down to your word against theirs that you did not want to have the payment done on the th however you may have some circumstancial evidence that this is what they aggreed to if you have proof that the payment was made on the th you could make a case that they agreed that the payment on the th was the payment for the month and they were not going to debit on the th without knowing every little detail this would be a reasonable conclusion enough to win a case though you don't need to get a lawyer or anything the simplest thing would be to file a small claims case against them you can file it in the county you live in and not where they are located you can either go to your county courts web site or down to the court itself and they will be able to tell you how to file a case if you win you could also make any claims for punitive damages but since the listing is actually removed from your report the chances of getting any would be small for there is a chance they won't even show up and you would win by default  Credit card Bank fraud Internet fraud Estoppel Student loan Bond Cheque Plame affair Debit card Annuity United Kingdom corporation tax Money Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Insurance Debt Bank Article One of the United States Constitution Advance fee fraud EFTPOS Contract Appeal Child support Schabir Shaik Trial Legal tender Gold standard Surveillance Mortgage Mensal__o scandal Taxation in the United States SCO-Linux controversies Social Security (United States) Microeconomics Poker jargon Federal Reserve Mail fraud Medical malpractice Security (finance) Copyright Bretton Woods system Automated Clearing House Identity theft Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Hyperinflation Financial audit Open access Health insurance Derivative (finance) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Economy of Russia Karl Rove National Kidney Foundation Singapore Government debt FairTax Oil-for-Food Programme Scientific method Fractional-reserve banking Monetary policy Money supply Terri Schiavo Katelyn Faber Credit card fraud Password Trust (Law) USA Schapelle Corby Life insurance Credit repair Electronic money Canada Health Act Craps American individualist anarchism Graduate school Capital accumulation Interest Finance Probation officer CPU cache Lawyer Unemployment benefit Tom DeLay Israeli West Bank barrier James Hanratty Automatic teller machine Commodity markets Octopus card Secretar__a de Inteligencia Enron Corporation Intelligent design Economy of the United States Payroll Treaty

is a an okay credit score how can i make it better i only have account which is my car i got pre approved for a credit card but then when i applied for it online i was declined i would really like to better my credit score i need some advice i hate to break it to you but that is a really bad score it is below average for all americans and that speaks volumes think about your average american this is a hypothetical person who is way over their head in debt has been known to pick and chose which bills he she pays borrows irresponsibly sums of money which he she has no reasonable way of repaying with certainty etc now i am not saying this is you what i am saying is that with a rating like that that is what your score is saying to potential creditors what does that mean in the great american tradition of debt financing creditors will probably still lend you money i e extend credit but now they have an excuse to rip you off on horrible terms they will charge you ridiculous rates of interest stick you with bs fees and surcharges etc they justify ripping you off because now you are a high credit risk never mind that they are making money on you hand over fist you really want to be well north of on your credit score average among americans is actually quite poor when it comes to fiscal responsibility don't make mediocrity your goal that will take time and an almost religious dedication to paying all your bills on time everytime every little slip up fair or not will cost you dearly that means living much more modestly before you charge something on a credit card think am i paying with my money or with money i don't have if you couldn't cover it with money you already have in the bank don't buy it period it is hard but in my humble opinion it is worth it also consider your car payment a fixed expense when you make money before you spend it on yourself pay the car payment think of it this way when you owe money the money you make is not yours until you pay the guy you owe i know i am not pitching some quick credit repair scheme that is not me and you should be wary of those who do there really are no shortcuts to success in life  Credit card Mortgage Student loan Bond Debt Government debt Bank Deflation (economics) Insurance Predatory lending Interest Finance Money Bretton Woods system Monetary policy Microeconomics Life insurance Islamic banking Inflation Estoppel Personal finance Capital accumulation Security (finance) Hyperinflation FairTax Mutual fund Developing countries' debt Usury Great Depression Corporation Social Security (United States) Economy of Pakistan Derivative (finance) Tax Short selling Internet fraud Economy of the United States Stock Taxation in the United States Gold standard Microcredit Bank fraud History of the United States (1918-1945) Corporate finance Health insurance Schabir Shaik Trial Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus U.S. public debt United Kingdom corporation tax Arbitrage Economy of India Debt levels and flows Poker jargon Fiat money Publicly funded medicine Keynesian economics Fractional-reserve banking Social Credit Legal tender Argentine Currency Board Arthur Laffer Micropayment Advance fee fraud Education in the United States Money supply Bankruptcy Gambling Unemployment benefit Babe Ruth Article One of the United States Constitution Leeds United F.C.

is anyone planning on paying their mortgage i mean if others will get help for not paying why should anyone pay because that assistance is limited if everybody stopped paying the assistance would collapse overnight not to mention what would happen to the real estate market as a whole i hear your frustration though why should you have to stand on the sidelines while those who got in over their heads get financial help it is unfair but you will benefit from it believe me if those properties go into foreclosure it will very likely have a negative effect on the value of your home when appraisal time rolls around if these people can stay afloat it will prevent the equity in your property from disappearing this is a messy situation and won't be fixed any time soon so sit tight the ride is just getting started  Mortgage Deflation (economics) Allodial title Insurance Real estate Predatory lending Government National Mortgage Association Real estate bubble Property tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Life insurance Mortgage-backed security Real estate broker Great Depression Flat tax Taxation in the United States Debt Housing cooperative Income trust Bond FairTax Foreclosure Trust (Law) USA Public transport Microeconomics Personal finance Concurrent estate Poker jargon Real estate developer Construction Corporate governance Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Federal National Mortgage Association Security (finance) Intellectual property California Proposition 13 (1978) Common Agricultural Policy Derivative (finance) Donald Trump Assignment (law) Islamic banking Minimum wage Primerica Financial Services Estoppel Capitalism Inheritance tax Public policy Leasing Asian financial crisis New York Giants Tariff Annuity Trust (Law) non-USA Mutual fund Keynesian economics 401(k) Title insurance Externality Gold standard Financial services Unemployment Real estate appraisal British property bubble History of post-Soviet Russia Fee simple Tax Oakland Athletics Monopoly (game) American football strategy Personal property Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Affirmative action Natural monopoly Easement Worldwide ERC Debt levels and flows Student loan Leasehold estate Wells Fargo Dogpatch USA Salary cap History of the United States (1918-1945) British residential property market Government of Maryland Futures contract ACORN Thomas de Littleton Kyoto Protocol Inflation Economy of Russia Schabir Shaik Trial Health insurance Variable universal life insurance Warren Buffett Annual percentage rate Shaggy dog story New Deal Copyright Glossary of American football

can a credit card company or debt company take u to court i am struggling with sum debt at the mo i was fine paying it all off before i was sighned off work with depression and whilst some creditors have been ok a couple are sending me letters saying they will take me to court can they i have offered them a fixed monthly fee til im back at work and its silly that the debts are less then and they are threatning me when i have one creditir who i owe a few thousand too who are more then happy to wait the stress of this is just making my depression worse and i dont want to feel suicidal again like i did when i was at my worst please help oh another thing i get a month once is split between my creditors i have too live on a week i dont understand where they think i can get the money from yes unfortunately they can take you to court however this is not a criminal court and you don't even have to turn up if you don't want to basically you end up with a ccj and the judge orders you to pay it ruins your credit rating you can put in a defence though with your incoming and outgoing money and the judge will only order you to pay what you can afford can be as small as a week so sometimes although it ruins your credit it can be a blessing as you are ordered to pay less than what the credit card company would want you to pay it is better to try and make an arrangement with the company yourself though and save your credit rating its not really worth companies taking you to court for small amounts of money but they threaten it to try and get you to pay i m sure that you can come to a private repayment arrangement at a monthly fee you can afford if you set this up though its vital that you stick to it go to the cab and they should be able to help you to organise your finances and sort out arrangements with your lenders  Debt Mortgage Credit card Bond Bank Student loan Interest Corporation Government debt Money Annuity Great Depression Insurance Schabir Shaik Trial Bretton Woods system Divorce Monetary policy Predatory lending Deflation (economics) Economy of Russia Advance fee fraud Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Estoppel Enron Corporation Short selling Debt levels and flows Bankruptcy Social Security (United States) Developing countries' debt Internet fraud Security (finance) Keynesian economics Personal finance Babylonian law Poker jargon Hyperinflation U.S. public debt Capital accumulation Gross domestic product Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Donald Trump Unemployment GSM services Debt bondage Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Taxation in the United States National Kidney Foundation Singapore EastEnders Gold standard History of the United States (1918-1945) Credit score Finance Arbitrage United States Postal Service Credit repair Bank fraud Government National Mortgage Association Islamic banking Unemployment benefit Derivative (finance) Stock History of post-Soviet Russia Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Debt consolidation Microeconomics Citigroup Life insurance FairTax Economy of the United States Financial services Primerica Financial Services Legal tender Microcredit Gold as an investment Surveillance Usury Tom DeLay 3dfx Charles Ponzi Medical malpractice Currency Blackjack United Kingdom corporation tax Child support Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Tennessee State Constitution Capitalism Confidence trick Economy of Argentina 401(k) Annual percentage rate Financial markets SCO-Linux controversies James Hanratty Avenue Q

need help figuring out a term when looking for credit cards alright seeing as the popularity of credit cards is growing i'm taking intrest however some stores that i like local ones don't take credit cards so i was wondering if anyone knew the term for this type of service you can go to an atm thing and it'll give you cash if you put in your credit card like if i needed for shopping i could just go and put my credit card into the machine and tell it how much i need and it'll give it to me right away instead of using my debit card this service would be really helpful and so if anyone knows any credit cards that do it please share thanks in advance its called cash advance there's a charge for this which can vary depending on the card provider it is either a amount of the cash you take out or a flat fee again depending on the card company on top of that though the amount you take out will actually be amount you'd need to repay so there's interest on the balance as well that is if the balance you owe goes past what they call the grace period which is the amount of time where interest isn't added onto what you have to pay back what i would recommend you do instead of major credit cards is to get a debit card from a checking account there's no interest on them plus nearly all of them have major logos on them visa mastercard you can use them at all atm's and even use them for things like airline tickets hotel reservations and rental cars make sure to read all the fine print on any credit card you're thinking about getting too because there is a ton of hidden fees its probably one of if not the most sketchy industries out there  Debit card Bank EFTPOS Octopus card Citigroup Insurance SmartRider Internet fraud Discover Card Surveillance Mutual fund Oyster card MasterCard Interest E-ZPass Financial services Filling station Slot machine Monopoly (game) Bond Public transport Mortgage MetroCard Personal finance Taxation in the United States The Amazing Race Double-entry book-keeping Ulster Bank Betting (poker) Poker jargon Money supply Annuity Cheque Predatory lending EasyGroup Electronic money Schabir Shaik Trial Scrip Debt Wheel of Fortune United Kingdom corporation tax Stock Stored-value card Identity theft MapleStory Donald Trump Virgin Mobile Tax Mainframe computer Chip and PIN Loyalty program Leasing Postage stamp Money creation Monetary policy Financial audit Advance fee fraud Let's Make a Deal Primerica Financial Services Microeconomics Interac Tarot Textile manufacturing Toll road Marshall Plan Tesco Economy of Chile FairTax Euro CPU design Aldi Sears Holdings Corporation Inflation Islamic banking Cooperative Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Accounting methods Alcohol fuel Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks National Kidney Foundation Singapore Life insurance Cruising (maritime) Short selling Floppy disk Rafic Hariri International Airport

is this is a good move for me i applied for a credit card today with my bank they approved me with a spending limit of i'm going to use it basically as my debit instead just switch over funds when the montly payment come in and spot the interst percent due to student credit card anyways when my max limit reaches about say i want to buy a car completely on credit giving my taurus as a down payment then giving some cash and then rest on credit completely pay for it avoiding the high monthly payments and high interest rate then pay off my credit card at percent what do you think the only problem with what you are going to do is that you will exceed of your credit limit and this will cause your score to take a hit if this is not a concern then you should be fine auto finance is what i do for a living  Bank Insurance Social Security (United States) Bond Toll road Mortgage Internet fraud Money Credit score FairTax Finance Inflation Taxation in the United States Bank fraud Debt Wachovia Citigroup Electronic money Monetary policy Financial services Bretton Woods system Cheque Auto insurance Public transport Education in the United States Surveillance U.S. public debt Economy of the United States SmartRider Corporate finance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Life insurance Graduate school Primerica Financial Services Kyoto Protocol Collateralized debt obligation Interest Great Depression Annuity Article One of the United States Constitution Filling station Government debt History of the United States (1918-1945) United Kingdom corporation tax Campaign finance reform Gross domestic product United Overseas Bank Legal tender Capital accumulation Smart card Keynesian economics Grand Theft Auto (game) RFID Food Stamp Program Mergers and acquisitions Gold standard Mutual fund Islamic banking Economy of Africa Security (finance) Unemployment Schabir Shaik Trial Dividend Interac Social Credit Education in the People's Republic of China Derivative (finance) Child support Double-entry book-keeping Cerritos, California Predatory lending Slot machine Federal Reserve Deflation (economics) Credit history Credit card fraud History of post-Soviet Russia Dave Ramsey London Congestion Charge Octopus card National Insurance Deficit spending Tertiary education fees in Australia Oyster card Commodity markets Tax VISA (credit card) Payday loan International Monetary Fund Bank of America

i am repairing my own credit but i need some pointers i have taken off the two adverse reports on my credit report however in l i had about different cards at that time i had closed all my accounts this looks bad how do i reverse that do i need to get all these credit card accounts off my report any ideas on how to establish credit now you should be able to remove items that are over years old if the date of closure predates today by seven years you can ask for the items to be removed and they should be make sure you explain that the closed accounts are hurting your credit scores i dont think they really are but if you say so positive entries are technically allowed indefinitely so you need to stress the negative effects of the accounts establish credit with a couple of credit cards try orchard bank or capital one you might be able to get a card that is not secured do not make the mistake many people make they charge an amount and pay it off every month that's not what creditors want to see they want to see you handle a balance over time so pay the account every month on time and pay more than the minimum due naturally make sure you pay everything else on time as well it took time to mess up your credit it takes time to fix it hang in there  Credit card Bond United Kingdom corporation tax Financial audit Student loan Mutual fund Mortgage Bank Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Deflation (economics) Credit score Taxation in the United States Double-entry book-keeping Derivative (finance) Bretton Woods system Octopus card Social Security (United States) Personal finance Debt Credit history Blackjack Credit repair Interest Surveillance Commodity markets Internet fraud Debit card Poker jargon Betting (poker) Short selling Futures contract Arbitrage Schabir Shaik Trial Annuity Phishing Consensus decision-making Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Microeconomics Cheque Debt levels and flows Economy of Russia Bank fraud Corporation Identity theft Health insurance Capital accumulation Food Stamp Program Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind FairTax Wal-Mart Plame affair Wealth Contract bridge Estoppel Enron Corporation Money supply SmartRider Life insurance Gold standard Mainframe computer Money Islamic banking Certificate of deposit Citigroup Tom DeLay Article One of the United States Constitution Baccarat Euro Gold as an investment Corporate governance Solar variation Israeli West Bank barrier Accountancy Windows XP Graduate school Micropayment HSBC Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories National Football League National Insurance London Congestion Charge Education in the People's Republic of China Credit card fraud Video poker Trust (Law) USA Sears Holdings Corporation Cricket Unemployment Social Security debate (United States) Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Automatic teller machine Neopets E-ZPass 401(k) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Income statement Electricity meter RuneScape Economic inequality

bankruptcy how do they know if you take out rrsp's after bankruptcy when they are supposed to get the funds ok we went into bankruptcy and our rrsps were funds we could get anytime because of this they said if we withdraw them they are supposed to go to him now my question is this how do they know if we say take half out do they followup is there a message with our rrsps to notify him reason is i have some bills to pay and need to take some out please help please only if you absolutely know answer most of the time rrsps are treated like assets and are liquidated during a bankruptcy however there are some exceptions first if your rrsp is locked in due to previous employment the trustee is not permitted to take the rrsp an example of this would be an employee who works for a company with a pension plan when the employee leaves for retirement the accumulated pension entitlement is transformed into a locked in rrsp the term locked in means the employee cannot cash in the rrsp or take money out of it until he or she retires if the employee is unable to get the money usually a trustee would also be unable to get it confusion often results from the term locked in sometimes people make a payment to an rrsp at a bank and the funds inside the rrsp are a locked in investment a guaranteed investment certificate for instance it can be locked in for several years to allow the investor to develop a higher interest rate if you file for bankruptcy the trustee could cash in your five year accumulation to distribute to your creditors another type of rrsp that cannot be liquidated is an rrsp that has a life insurance component this exception can be complicated so it is wise to consult a bankruptcy trustee to discuss the matter bill c which was passed in november of proposed that most rrsps be exempt in a bankruptcy unfortunately the bill is still being written and has not yet been declared part of the law it is very important that you discuss rrsps with a licensed bankruptcy trustee before going ahead with bankruptcy it is essential that you get help in determining the current laws in halifax  Annuity Life insurance Bond Social Security (United States) Mutual fund Insurance Debt Bankruptcy Bank Registered Retirement Savings Plan Article One of the United States Constitution Trust (Law) USA Pension 401(k) Mortgage Tax Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Security (finance) Economy of Russia United Kingdom corporation tax Deflation (economics) Enron Corporation SCO-Linux controversies Income trust Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Fractional-reserve banking Interest Government debt Taxation in the United States Social Security debate (United States) Trusts and estates Microeconomics Individual Savings Account FairTax Trust (Law) non-USA Inflation Bankruptcy in the United States Variable universal life insurance Derivative (finance) Islamic banking Primerica Financial Services Dividend Surplus value Capital accumulation Appeal Hedge fund Institutional fund management PE ratio Economy of India Pretty Good Privacy Corporation Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Privatization Keynesian economics Ponzi scheme Retirement plan Citigroup Collateralized debt obligation Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Bretton Woods system Asset Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code Lloyd's of London Publicly funded medicine Health insurance Bank fraud Electronic money Estoppel Stock Poker jargon Finance Microsoft Contract Open access Public domain Gold standard Classified information National Kidney Foundation Singapore Labor theory of value Monetary policy Investment Temasek Holdings Usury Treasury security Municipal bond Commodore International Euro Yield curve United Airlines Corporate personhood Student loan Money

fix credit i have a couple things on my credit report that are about bucks each people have told me to get in touch with the collection people and ask them to send me a letter that will say that they will either remove it from my report or they will mark it as paid after talking with all the people they won't do that they say we promise we will do that i know that you can't trust them and i'm worried that even though we have settled on a lower payment but without putting it on paper i know that they will leave it on my report and demand the rest before removing it what is the best way remedy this any suggestions i'm not looking for a service to do this for me so please no advertisements oh and i haven't sent in the payments yet waiting on something from them to prove they won't ask for more and will update my credit report that is what i'm asking for suggestions but my question is that without them sending me something that says they will settle for less then how will i be able to prove to the credit bureau that we settled for something what would keep the creditor from taking my payment and then saying where is the rest we aren't taking it off till you pay everything are the debts more than seven years old i mean the original debt let's say you owed sears bucks in and they sent it to a collection agency and that collection agency sent it to another one etc a debt can no longer be reported after seven years from the original date of default not date of referral to the collection agency so if the debt is old enough you might be able to have it removed another issue is the statute of limitations on collection of the debt if the debt is out of statute you have some leverage over the collection agency because technically they cant sue you for the amount outstanding and you are doing them a favor by paying them anything finally the process for getting a committment from them is somewhat easy tell them to fax you a letter that says we agree to settle the outstanding debt get account number etc for upon receipt we will remove all negative credit reporting with respect to this debt from all three major credit reporting agency reports or something to that effect some creditors will not give you that statement because technically it violates their agreement with the credit bureaus but at the very least you can get them to say the debt is paid in full or settled they have to report that no question  Bond Debt Credit card Mortgage Contract Article One of the United States Constitution Plame affair Estoppel Annuity Debt levels and flows Schabir Shaik Trial Tom DeLay Student loan Appeal United Kingdom corporation tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Deflation (economics) Corporation Child support FairTax Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Taxation in the United States Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Credit repair Government debt Derivative (finance) Credit score Timeline of the Enron scandal Interest Security (finance) Economy of Russia Mail Gold standard Monetary policy Divorce Legal tender Surveillance Mensal__o scandal Killian documents History of the Jews in England Mergers and acquisitions Bretton Woods system Financial audit Credit default swap Third party beneficiary Bush v.

does anyone know the statute of limitations in illinois and ohio i am recieving calls from a collection agency in ohio the debt is years old they called me weeks ago and i have yet to recieve anything in writing from them they called me today and i stated i have still not recieved a letter from them and they told me to become a man and pay my bills and to stop stalling by waiting on a letter please help the link that the first poster shows an incorrect sol for open oral accounts in ohio the sol for open accounts is years not you did not mention what type of debt it is if it is a credit card ohio code excludes credit cards as written accounts the collector has violated a usc g of the fdcpa and possibly other violations as well a within five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt a debt collector shall unless the following information is contained in the initial communication or the consumer has paid the debt send the consumer a written notice containing http www ftc gov os statutes fdcpa fdcpact htm if the first time you have heard from this collection agency was by that phone call weeks ago send them a debt validation letter before days has passed from that contact do not sign your name to the letter only print your initials or type your name send it certified mail return receipt they must cease all collection activities until they validate which could include selling the account to another collector if it has been that long since you defaulted they cannot legally place it on your credit report if you are past the collecting sol after they validate or days have passed since they signed the green certified card send them a sol letter a correctly worded sol letter will keep them from contacting you again if you are past sol and inform them of that fact they will probably not sue since the judge would not look favorably on them for filing suit on a debt they know is time barred you might click on the last link i have listed in my profile do some reading in the credit forum edit while some states allow the collecting sol to be re set if a payment is made after the account is charged off it is generally when a written agreement is made before or at the time of payment i would not recommend sending a full cease desist without including the fact the account is time barred i wouldn't send either a sol letter or a c d as your first letter i would recommend that you send a validation letter if you are still within the first days from their first contact it will keep them in validation which would legally tie their hands until they provide proper validation after years it is unlikely but not impossible for them to be able to provide validation  United States Postal Service Credit card Plame affair Article One of the United States Constitution Contract E-mail spam Gmail Copyright Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mail Appeal 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Tom DeLay Medical prescription Internet fraud Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Annuity 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Postage stamp Phishing Password Trademark 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Bush v.

what is the best and fastest way to build my credit score i have good credit but not much of it and i want excellent credit everybody's talking about what to do to build up the score but i think that it would help even more if you knew what actually made up your score to give you a better idea payment history total debt vs available credit length of time establishing credit average age of accounts types of accounts established inquiries new accounts with all that said now what you can do is this review all your credit reports and dispute anything that you know's not correct with the credit bureaus incorrect information someway somehow winds up on reports bringing down scores if you have any accounts in collections make arrangements to get them taken care of here's a link that i posted to a website that explains in detail on how to setlle debt with collectors read the entire article closely there are parts to it and whatever open accounts that you do have make sure that you pay on time if don't have one already open a checking account and take advantage of their online banking with billpay feature like i mentioned earler payment history counts more than a of your score so pay on time if you have credit cards try to pay the balances on them to where they're around or below the available credit at any given time having cards that are maxed or close to it hurts your score also after you've cleaned up delinquencies and paid down your balances ask for an increase to give more cushion to your available credit if you have old accounts that you're not using start using them instead of closing them the longer you've had an account the better since this would be considered a seasoned account especially if it's been opened longer than years start cancelling accounts and it will give the appearance that you've established credit more recently than it actually has don't apply for unecessary credit each time you apply it creates a hard inquiry that can drop your score several points regardless if you're approved or not and it can take anywhere from months to a year for your score to increase if you are approved once the new account starts reporting if you don't have any open credit lines and you're needing to establish credit the easiest option would be opening a secured credit card which are offered at a lot of credit unions and at some banks you can think of ths as building credit with a savings account because that's basically how it works a deposit is placed upfront usually linked to a savings account that's used as collateral to establish a credit line of the same amount for example you place a deposit of then the credit line would be you still would receive a statement and have to pay for whatever's used on the card since the deposit is only for collateral while placing a deposit may seem like a disadvantage there's more hidden advantages like the deposit gaining interest while you're building credit and the ability to increase the credit line by adding to the deposit and a tip to using the card is to make small purchases month that can be paid off every month to keep the balance on the card in check usuall anwhere after a year or so of paying on time and keeping the balance low or even at the card either converts to a regular card or a better card is offered and best of all you get the deposit back with some added interest i posted links to several secured credit card companies you should have anywhere from major credit cards and department store card to start out with of course you can get more but it's not wise to load up on credit cards alone student loans furniture loans appliance loans car loans boat loans motorcycle loans and mortgages all are example of installment credit and it helps to have of those to create a balanced mixture of credit i know that it's a lot of information but i'm confident that it will help you out a lot  Mortgage Student loan Bond Bank Annuity Surveillance Credit score Money supply

what are my options medical collections etc i have multiple medical collections about to be exact one civil judgement in relation to the medical issues and having been evicted see below and two other derogatory accounts one from a previous landlord when i was sick for days with a 'mystery virus' which is also the major reason behind these medical collections and one from tcf bank when i was much younger the total of these bills is approximately and i have some other medical bills that i have been paying since then about k i have a 'ok' amount of disposable income at the moment but have a child on the way what are your suggestions currently i am a consumer loan specialist so i understand the scenario which i am in but how do i dig myself out if noone wants to give me a personal loan any advice is welcome and needed as a note most of the collection agencies want payment in full for example the collection agency that is coming after me for the amount on the eviction wants to collect they will settle for but only if i pay every two weeks this is definately out of my range i could theoretically afford month but a month is pretty hefty in my opinion settle with your creditors pay it off for less than you owe most of them will settle for about if you argue right and its no worse for your credit that the collections that are on there in response credit collection agencies buy your debt for pennies on the dollar of course they want it paid in full they will normally try to bully or scare you into payment if you will just play nice but be stern that you cant afford anything else they will play ball i have dont this for myself before you want paid and i want done with this right great i can afford 'x' if you will settle today if they say i just cant do that play the game twist their words cant or wont or try well can i speak with someone who can you get the point you have to be as aggressive as they are about it  Credit card Bond Student loan Great Depression Mortgage Deflation (economics) Insurance Annuity Legal tender Estoppel Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Taxation in the United States Government debt Microeconomics Money Credit score Corporation United Kingdom corporation tax FairTax Bretton Woods system Security (finance) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economy of the United States History of the United States (1918-1945) Economy of Russia Life insurance Gold standard Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Debt Monetary policy Child support Interest Bank Stock Health insurance 401(k) Social Security (United States) Pound sterling Cheque Debt levels and flows Hyperinflation Capital accumulation Money supply Credit repair Unemployment benefit Social Credit Wheel of Fortune United States dollar Poker jargon Anarcho-capitalism Euro Publicly funded medicine Developing countries' debt Leasehold estate Baccarat National Kidney Foundation Singapore Schabir Shaik Trial Surveillance Mensal__o scandal Predatory lending Bolivia Public transport Margin (finance) Credit derivative Personal finance Article One of the United States Constitution Unemployment Volleyball Weimar Republic Prisoner's dilemma Derivative (finance) Islamic banking Rick Santorum Microcredit Primerica Financial Services U.S. public debt Reparations for slavery Contract Jack Lang (Australian politician) Inflation Anarchism and capitalism Same-sex marriage RuneScape quests Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans Golf Jack Thompson History of the United States Constitution Internet fraud Appeal Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Economy of Argentina Keynesian economics Nuclear power phase-out Citigroup Supply and demand Flat tax

after day late payment hits your credit then what im assuming that my soon to be ex is just behind on his payments but what if he continues to pay every month after that late payments are a major score killer they will remain on your credit reports for years from the date of the late you definitely need to speak with your soon to be ex and find out what is going on you didn't mention what type of account it is if it's a credit card account and you are a joint user you might request that your stb ex get a loan to pay the account off then close it if it is a vehicle and you are on the loan you might request that he sell it and pay the note off or get another loan in his name only without listing every type of loan or credit you can see my point get your name off of the account if it is an account where you are only an authorized user dispute the account with the cra's as not having the account in your name since legally it is not your account once you get your name off of the account you might send the creditor a goodwill letter and explain the reason behind the late payment request that they remove the late payment notation from your reports if you are an authorized user or the account gets paid off and closed you may lose the entire tradeline when disputing with the cra's or requesting the creditor to remove the late notation if that happens you would probably take a hit on your scores for losing the account but it would be much better than living with a late notation for the next years keep in mind that as long as your name is on the account if he eventually defaults on it it will go on your credit reports as a default and you may be held liable for it  Credit card Annuity Mortgage Islamic banking Bond Credit score Insurance Debt Cheque Bank United Kingdom corporation tax Plame affair Concurrent estate Money Bretton Woods system Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Schabir Shaik Trial Fractional-reserve banking Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Corporation Internet fraud Credit repair Credit derivative Bank fraud Japan-United States relations Life insurance Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Octopus card Legal tender Gold standard Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Estoppel Euro Article One of the United States Constitution Derivative (finance) GNU General Public License Primerica Financial Services Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Phishing 401(k) Government debt Economy of Russia Credit default swap Xbox Live Timeline of the Enron scandal Financial audit Mail fraud Food Stamp Program Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Contract Credit risk Double-entry book-keeping History of the Jews in England Canada Health Act Bank of China (Hong Kong) Wachovia HTTP cookie Alex Ferguson Accounting methods Social Security (United States) Copyleft Short selling Canadian National Railway Mortgage-backed security Credit history Playing card E-ZPass Economy of Argentina Developing countries' debt Identity theft Mensal__o scandal Spyware E-mail spam Oxford English Dictionary Taxation in the United States Gmail Universal life insurance Stock Password Government National Mortgage Association PayPal London Congestion Charge Citigroup Tennessee State Constitution Animal Crossing SCO-Linux controversies LiveJournal Advance fee fraud Toll road Trust (Law) USA E-mail Currency Social Credit Neopets Usury Fiat money David Beckham

will this increase my credit score if i am added to my grandmother's jcpenny card that that is in good standing as a joint user will this increase my score i need a point increase in my score to get a home loan my goal is november i've already raised my score points this year i just need that next boost please help in short there isn't much you can do in such a short period of time to bring your score up to where you want it a couple of points though first do not get involved with your grandmothers jc penny card the best thing to do is keep your credit independent of another person unless you are married no joint accounts some people might also suggest getting another credit card this is a bad idea for a couple of reasons first just applying for the card will trigger a credit check on the part of the credit card company which will bring your score down a few points then if you don't actually get the card it stays down second if you get the card it could take a few weeks to get the card and many companies will not start reporting your score until you have a balance this could take a few months the fact that you have a revolving credit line with a balance no matter how small could potentially bring the score down the best thing you can do is tend to any bad debts you have on your account and pay down a few other debts even this though may not increase it enough by november it just depends on what is on your report you could also try a different lender some lenders require a minimum score to get the good rates which is what i assume you are trying to do but there are others that aren't as concerned about this the disadvantage here is that the rates are usually quite higher a score as low at is good enough for some lenders anything lower and you shouldn't even bother trying to buy a home here's what i suggest contact a broker and have them find a lender that will work with your current circumstances tell them you want a year arm adjustable rate mortgage this will get you the best rate for your score once you get the home your credit score will shoot up quite quickly months because mortgages score really well keep paying on time and after two years refinance on a year fixed this will not only secure you a lower rate but your equity earned through principal and appreciation would be enough that you could potentially walk away with cash in your pocket at closing in short lower payments and cash in your pocket such a sweet deal  Student loan Bond Finance Insurance Bank Debt Predatory lending Credit score Monetary policy Deflation (economics) FairTax Personal finance Life insurance Microeconomics Interest Corporate finance Betting (poker) Poker jargon Mutual fund Primerica Financial Services Bretton Woods system Short selling Inflation Octopus card Gold standard Mortgage-backed security Debt consolidation Annuity Federal National Mortgage Association Mergers and acquisitions Security (finance) Capital accumulation Unemployment Collateralized debt obligation Economy of Russia Flat tax United Kingdom corporation tax Social Security (United States) Islamic banking Credit history Great Depression Debt levels and flows Social Security debate (United States) Arbitrage Schabir Shaik Trial Supply and demand Derivative (finance) Extreme Programming Temasek Holdings Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Health insurance Gross domestic product Stock Yield curve Privatization Free trade Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Economic inequality Margin (finance) Economy of the United States Bank fraud Arthur Laffer Money Microcredit Economy of Chile 401(k) Electrophysiology Surveillance Real estate broker Ford Motor Company Double-entry book-keeping Money supply Refinancing Minimum wage Corporate governance GunBound Annual percentage rate Financial audit Internet fraud Donald Trump Rational pricing Plame affair Futures contract Divorce Ra (board game) Marshall Plan Economy of Pakistan

will it hurt my credit to exceed my credit limit i have no credit but was issued a credit card through my work i'm a cashier at a department store in order to receive my discount on the merchandise i buy my credit limit is and i went over by this month will this hurt my credit and will there be a fee also how long do i have to wait to request that my credit limit be increased is such a small amount and with the paychecks i earn i can surely afford to spend more than that i get paid tomorrow and plan on paying the bill in full asap mangamaniaciam paying my bill off in montly payments would result in hefty interest charges my current balance is and the interest rate is so i'm definitely paying it off in full if they choose to drop me from their credit company then good for them i won't shop in their store regardless of whether i work there or not the phamplet i got with my credit card states that there is overlimit fee so i suppose this is a good thing the credit card terms vary but most will charge an overlimit fee to pay the account down before you get the statement or due date won't help going over your limit won't be reported to the credit bureau so isn't what hurts your score the ratio of debt to available credit is a big part of your credit score anything over debt kills your score with a limit it won't take much to go over the best way to increase that credit limit is to pay the account in full and on time every month be sure not to go over you limit again it might take months to a year before they increase your limit  Credit card Bond Student loan Wal-Mart Social Security (United States) Bank FairTax Insurance Mutual fund Debt Mortgage Credit score Annuity Personal finance Sears Holdings Corporation Internet fraud Futures contract Neopets Microeconomics Octopus card Gold standard United Kingdom corporation tax Mergers and acquisitions Primerica Financial Services Taxation in the United States Life insurance Deflation (economics) Debt consolidation PE ratio London Congestion Charge Betting (poker) Filling station Economy of Russia Credit card fraud Finance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tax Money Tertiary education fees in Australia Poker jargon Social Security debate (United States) Credit history Legal tender Financial audit Interest Capitalism Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Publicly funded medicine Monetary policy Auto insurance Gross domestic product Salary cap Short selling Public transport Best Buy Economy of the United States Financial services Cheque Minimum wage Treasury security Food Stamp Program Education in the United States Intellectual property Deficit spending Member of the European Parliament Government debt EFTPOS Stock Schabir Shaik Trial U.S. public debt Euro Variable universal life insurance Fiat money Higher Education Bill Hyperinflation Capital accumulation Islamic banking Corporation Double-entry book-keeping Child support Dividend History of the United States (1918-1945) Graduate school Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Cable television Tom DeLay Electronic commerce Article One of the United States Constitution Security (finance) MetroCard Bretton Woods system 401(k) Arbitrage Estoppel

can i be sued for credit card debt if i am making settlement payments i was told by a collection agency law firm that even if i am making payments on an agreed settlement that they will still seek a judgement on me and that i don't have to even show up to court or anything can they do this if i am making payments can they sue you yes will they sue you probably not if you have an agreement that they have approved and are paying as agreed they won't mainly because if it went to court the judge would throw it out now if you fail to make the payments as agreed they then will turn around and sue you if you have a law firm calling you you need to immediately send them a cease and desist letter in the letter state that you already have a settlement agreement with the company and are making payments as agreed include that they are to not contact you again in reference to the debt send this by certified mail with a return receipt if they do contact you again you can then take them to court for violations of the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa if for some reason they did sue you it would be to put it bluntly stupid of you to not show up in court if you don't show up they can pretty much say anything they want and you are not there to defend yourself they will then get a judgment in default  Article One of the United States Constitution GNU General Public License Fair Game (Scientology) Appeal Contract Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Child support Credit card SCO-Linux controversies Estoppel Divorce Fair use Debt Lawsuit Legal tender Timeline of the Enron scandal United States Postal Service United Kingdom corporation tax International Criminal Court Mail Copyright Due process Public domain Apple Computer Islamic banking Tax protester Royal Assent First-sale doctrine Credit score Judicial functions of the House of Lords International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict Social Security (United States) Declaratory judgment Public-key cryptography Internet fraud Tom DeLay Bush v.

is it true that if you use your checks it helps build credit for you i was wondering this for a long time so i finally remember to post it and see if it is true i heard that if you send your payments with your personal check you can build credit is it true no checks are similar to cash you build credit not so much by paying bills on time but by the ratio of outstanding revolving debt to total open credit lines paying on time is almost a given but available credit to debt ratio is a more important factor  Credit card Bond Cheque Debt Internet fraud Insurance PE ratio Mortgage-backed security Bank Money supply Collateralized debt obligation Bank fraud Primerica Financial Services Security (finance) Finance Mortgage Personal finance Gold standard Deflation (economics) Interest Credit derivative Mutual fund Debt levels and flows Annuity Legal tender Compensation of employees Credit default swap Fractional-reserve banking Economy of the United States Money Double-entry book-keeping The Amazing Race Betting (poker) Marshall Plan Social Credit Government debt FairTax Student loan Euro Accounts payable Child support Financial audit Surveillance Article One of the United States Constitution Derivative (finance) Currency The South Sea Company Payroll Unemployment benefit Tom DeLay Economy of Russia Debt consolidation Law of value Monetary policy Islamic banking Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Credit risk Treasury security Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Dave Ramsey High-yield debt Yield curve Lend-Lease Schabir Shaik Trial Flat tax Money creation Measures of national income and output XERF Futures contract United States Postal Service Economy of Croatia Corporate finance Slot machine Mergers and acquisitions Irrational number Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Electronic money History of the United States (1918-1945) Electricity meter Fiat money Universal life insurance Taxation in the United States Traveler's cheque Life insurance Economy of El Salvador Dividend Electronic commerce Convertible bond Tax Government of Maryland E-mail spam Great Depression Pension Luas Ford Motor Company Letter of credit Payday loan Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000

he's returning the car will it give him bad credit my boyfriend currently lost his job and cannot afford to pay the car that he took out a loan for about months ago he wants to return the car but isn't sure on if it will give him bad credit is it worse to have it repo'd or if he simply returns it what will end up happening does anyone know it's a dodge charger and it cost somewhere between i can answer that question from my own experience a voluntary repossession will show up on his credit report the loan carrier will sell his vehicle for far under it's value and that amount subtracted from the loan value he will still owe expect that amount to be in the thousands of dollars and the loan company to aggressively pursue that amount owed even if the statue of limitations runs out on the loan and they do not manage to sue him by them it will remain on his credit report causing great damage to his credit rating for a long time years i'm not sure if it will help but he can try and contact the creditor now and explain his situation he may be able to negotiate something with him to avoid a repossession it'd would be by far in his best interests another alternative is to advertise the vehicle in the paper or auto trader as a take over payments only sale do so quickly because once the loan defaults he will certainly wake up one morning without a vehicle  Insurance Corporation Credit card Mortgage Student loan Bond Great Depression Interest Life insurance Deflation (economics) Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Hyperinflation Annuity Bank Government debt Auto insurance Bretton Woods system Derivative (finance) Microeconomics Monetary policy Economy of Russia Citigroup 401(k) Taxation in the United States Dodge Charger Arbitrage Gold standard Short selling Credit score Money Primerica Financial Services Chrysler Corporation Capital accumulation Social Security (United States) Mergers and acquisitions Internet fraud E85 Grand Theft Auto (game) Air America Radio United Kingdom corporation tax Ford Motor Company Automobile Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Audi Pound sterling History of the United States (1918-1945) Credit derivative Bank fraud Sport utility vehicle Steve Jobs Weimar Republic Inflation Repurchase agreement Microcredit Kyoto Protocol Stock Schabir Shaik Trial Toyota Prius Privatization American Motors Babylonian law Money supply Estoppel Hire purchase Tire Economy of Argentina Yield curve Credit default swap Marshall Plan Futures contract Battery electric vehicle Enron Corporation Economy of Romania Personal finance Security (finance) Pharmaceutical company Health insurance Henry Ford Islamic economics Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Real estate broker U.S. public debt Filling station Tort reform Amtrak Muscle car MG Rover Group Call centre Unemployment Canadian Pacific Railway Capitalism

in what order should i pay off my credit report items oldest first lowest amt first to best raise my score looking for the quickest way to raise my score and improve my credit what if they won't remove item and only mark as paid will this still help if i understand your question right you have a bunch of debts listed as negative items on your report and you want to fix them first understand a couple of things before you even get started if you don't handle this correctly you are going to not only hurt your score but you will be spending money that won't help one bit toward fixing it the credit scoring system gives more attention to accounts with recent activity on them as time goes by they are not as important and the effect on your score goes down a little so for the first years these negative items are killing you but after that things improve also note that when you pay off an old debt they are only required to show paid on your credit report but all of the information about late payments charge off's and collection is still there it is still being listed as a negative item when you make a payment on an old debt they will update your credit history as mentioned above but it now changes the status of your credit item to recent even though the debt is paid this recent negative item will actually hurt your credit scores therefore you must be very carefull how to handle this demand that the creditor delete the entry from your credit score before you pay them a dime and get this agreement in writing that said when you pay off your debts the only real important order is in recent activities pay off the most recent debts make sure they delete them then work on the older ones note that negative items will automatically be deleted after years beginning from the date of the delinquency therefore unless you are in a super big hurry to increase your score don't mess with debts over year old is better these older debts are not hurting your score to a huge extent if you are not referring to negative items then your question is simple start by contacting the creditor and negotiate lower interest rates if possible then pay off the large interest loans first putting only minimum payments on the low interest cards once the largest is paid apply more money to the next card  Deflation (economics) Bond Taxation in the United States Debt Mortgage Student loan Annuity Bank Credit score Keynesian economics Government debt Estoppel Interest FairTax Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Microeconomics United Kingdom corporation tax Monetary policy Inflation Social Security (United States) Bretton Woods system Money Gold standard Money supply Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Euro Minimum wage Internet fraud Deficit spending Betting (poker) Flat tax Asian financial crisis Personal finance Unemployment Health insurance Economy of Pakistan Jeopardy!

what exactly is an unsecured line of credit an unsecured line of credit means the creditor does not have an item serving as collateral aka security for the loan for example a mortgage lender will have a deed of trust or other form of lien against the borrower's home an auto lender will have a lien against the title of the car these forms of security will give the lender the right to take the secured item house or car if the loan is not paid also these forms of security prevent the borrower from selling the secured item until the loan is paid off typically the unpaid balance of the loan will be repaid to the lender through an escrow account if the secured item is sold prior to repayment of the loan when the loan is unsecured the lender has none of these items so they have nothing to automatically take if the borrower doesn't repay if the borrower declares bankruptcy usually the secured lender eventually will be paid or obtain the secured item the unsecured lender only shares in the division of the bankrupt estate which usually results in a small fraction if any of the loan being repaid as a result unsecured loans are riskier for lenders and they usually charge much higher interest rates or insist on a much higher credit rating for the borrower  Bond Debt Predatory lending Interest Insurance Government debt Debt consolidation Finance Credit card Short selling Stock Islamic banking Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code Title insurance Bankruptcy in the United States Real estate broker Government National Mortgage Association Financial markets Microcredit Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Mortgage-backed security Lender of last resort Usury Corporation Foreclosure Security (finance) Credit score Central bank Annual percentage rate Great Depression Arbitrage Interest rate Subsidy Repurchase agreement Taxation in the United States Payday loan Savings and Loan crisis Islamic economics Monetary policy Savings and loan association Debt levels and flows Donald Trump Concurrent estate Money Mobile home Economy of Russia Annuity Securitization Fractional-reserve banking Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code Credit history Bankruptcy 401(k) Life insurance Money supply Collateralized debt obligation Tertiary education fees in Australia Developing countries' debt Primerica Financial Services Babylonian law Allodial title Inflation Gold standard Consumer finance Deficit Economy of Pakistan Social Security (United States) Capital accumulation Stamp duty Business cycle Economy of India Refinancing Mutual fund Derivative (finance) U.S. public debt Universal Studios Article One of the United States Constitution Asian financial crisis George W.

getting a car loan with bad credit when i was i got a couple credit cards and payed them good for a year then my job went shaky and i was out and no way to pay them back im now with a credit score of around since then i have gotten a very good job and wanting to get a new car im thinking of getting a car thats around k dollars would it be possible with my credit how big of a down payment do you think i would need i have a decent car i can trade in now or sell maybe for around k and can probably come up with around k to go with that for a downpayment would that be a pretty good downpayment on a loan amount that much i also plan to pay off those credit cards which wasnt that much most of it now is just finance charges will that help my score a lot or will it still be pretty low if those negative things are on there even if i payed them off two suggestions try to get the car now if you put k down on on k that's about which is some thing it will be hard to finance of the loan at that credit rating you have to remember that is won't cost a flat k and you may not get full blue book for the current car you have you will not get good value by trade in so try to sell it on your own i know you said you might have k but work w numbers that you know you can meet and anything above that will be to your benefit better that than the other way around be prepared for a high high interest rate of although the car industry is hurting there might be some good deals out there since your loan will be secured w the car as collateral wait more months it might sound like forever but if you are diligent and focused you will definitely have a higher credit score you shouldn't pay all the credit cards off completely leave at least a small balance i e used credit on one of them if they are all at zero balance it detract from your credit score sounds silly but that's how it works with a higher score you will have a lower interest rate remember that a car is not an investment they depreciate you want to avoid being upside down in a loan that is paying more for a car than it's worth due to a high interest rate so be sure to get a car with a payment you can afford being cute or cool looking good is fun but having a repo on your credit not worth it good luck  Credit card Bond Mortgage Student loan Microeconomics Economy of Russia Inflation Insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Interest Bank Unemployment Mutual fund Bretton Woods system Monetary policy Predatory lending Citigroup Collateralized debt obligation Free trade Capital accumulation Debt Keynesian economics Derivative (finance) Supply and demand Short selling FairTax Great Depression Islamic banking Donald Trump Real estate bubble Minimum wage Economy of India Security (finance) Bank fraud Life insurance History of the United States (1918-1945) Money Ra (board game) Credit score Flat tax 401(k) Social Security (United States) Government National Mortgage Association Poker jargon Primerica Financial Services Personal finance Arthur Laffer Financial services Gross domestic product Microcredit Subsidy Stock Tariff Economy of Pakistan Economy of El Salvador Asian financial crisis Internet fraud Wal-Mart Economy of the United States Taxation in the United States Hyperinflation PE ratio Government debt Mortgage-backed security Debt consolidation Progressive tax Ponzi scheme Dividend Kyoto Protocol Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Social Security debate (United States) Surplus value Corporate finance Mergers and acquisitions Economy of Chile Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Price discrimination EastEnders Extreme Programming Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social rule Pension Economy of the Philippines $ale of the Century Commodity markets Blackjack ELO rating system Depreciation

if a company checks your credit report to give you credit do they have to report it to the credit bureau i am trying to improve my credit and heard that if a company checks your credit to approve some kind of credit ex cell phone company approving phone service then if you ask them they have to put your good standing payments on your credit reports i am not sure how that works if any of you know that would be very helpful thank you there is no law or requirement that a company must report to the credit reporting agencies however they are required by the fcra fair credit reporting act that if they do report what they report must be correct the twist in this is that if you don't pay your cell phone bill and it gets turned over to collections they will report that negative item to your report  Credit score Credit repair Surveillance Credit card Credit history Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Bond Telephone tapping Identity theft Internet fraud Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Child support Telephone booth Insurance Copyleft Mobile phone FairTax Social Security (United States) Taxation in the United States Federal Communications Commission Experian United Kingdom corporation tax TransUnion Drug test Ocean's Twelve Annuity The Amazing Race United States Postal Service Act of Parliament GSM services Skype Poker jargon Food and Drug Administration Phone sex Octopus card Global System for Mobile Communications Probation officer Deflation (economics) Health insurance Data retention Plame affair Taxicab USA PATRIOT Act Fair Game (Scientology) United States Department of Agriculture Short message service Oil-for-Food Programme Kill Bill Union shop Plame affair timeline Liquid crystal display W.

first time credit card i just recently got a credit card and i'm wondering if having the apr that i do have is because this is my first credit card i'm a student with no credit anyway i know this is a ridiculously high apr but will i still be able to build credit as long as i pay off the bill each month last question someone told me that one way to build credit faster is to pay the minimum for one month and then pay the rest the next month is that true while availing a credit card it is necessary to check the credit card rate this rate plays an inevitable part as based on this rate your payment amount is decided various credit cards are available with different rate every time consumers try to choose a credit card at a lower interest rare most of the time it is seen that while choosing a credit card people generally check whether the rate is low or not but a low rate cannot be the only consideration in availing a credit card besides rate a consumer should heed in other factors as well remember though various credit card companies entice consumers with low interest rates at the same time they include various hidden costs and charges with a credit card as well so do not only verify the interest rate but also consider other things while availing a credit card many a time credit card companies offer low rate for a specific period of time such low rates are considered as an introductory offer of various companies in such cases check how long the offer will last after the period is over verify what the interest rate will be whether it will be affordable for you or not etc in case of rare use a consumer should try to get the card where no annual or monthly fee is charged in such cases if the interest rate is a bit high still the option will be beneficial read more from http www credit card gallery com article credit card rate better opportunity at the best rates  Student loan Blackjack Publicly funded medicine Insurance Life insurance Microeconomics Bank Mortgage Predatory lending Minimum wage Auto insurance Taxation in the United States Capitalism Credit history Interest Food and Drug Administration Mutual fund Deflation (economics) Internet fraud FairTax Broadband Internet access Annuity Monetary policy Octopus card United Kingdom corporation tax Public-key cryptography Food Stamp Program Certificate of deposit Credit card fraud Refinancing Bond Primerica Financial Services Annual percentage rate Unemployment Citigroup CPU cache Economy of Russia Redundant array of independent disks Debt Debit card America Online Microcredit Futures contract British national identity card The Amazing Race Wind power Verizon Wireless Price discrimination Apple Computer Education in the United States Virgin Mobile Poker jargon Public transport Betting (poker) Supply and demand Bank fraud Phishing Euro Education in Germany Gross domestic product Payday loan Secure Digital card Micropayment Debt consolidation Compact disc Flat tax Digital audio broadcasting Welding Cheque Baccarat Financial services Biodiesel Surveillance Corporate finance Hearts (game) Inflation Tax Illegal drug trade Graduate school Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Electricity meter 401(k) Open access Short selling Yield curve United States Postal Service Wal-Mart Social Security (United States) Economic inequality ATI Technologies Identity theft Digital photography Health insurance Draw poker

is it true that your credit report can be accessed without an ssn i heard that banks and other interested persons with a good reason can get a free look at your credit report just by typing in your name they do not need your social security number to do so just curious can they get your ssn off the credit report they pull up thanks the above statement is true for the most part i run a finance company and sometimes customers do not put their social security number on their credit applications however once i enter their information you need more then just a name i can review their credit usually their social security number does show up on the credit report the company person pulling your credit can not just have a good reason they need your permission too if you have a loan with a certain company for example a car and filled out a credit application they can pull your credit until the entire loan is paid in full they usually only do this if you don't pay  Credit card Identity theft Mortgage Social Security number (United States) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Bank fraud Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bond Debt United Kingdom corporation tax Internet fraud Student loan Interest Microcredit Short selling Bank Money Citigroup Social Security (United States) Islamic banking Security (finance) Contract Credit score Capitalism Corporate governance Life insurance Financial services Schabir Shaik Trial Credit repair Westlaw Cooperative Financial audit Primerica Financial Services TransUnion Surveillance Stock Finance BAE Systems Deflation (economics) Government debt Phishing Money supply Education in the United States Wachovia Predatory lending Bretton Woods system Graduate school Slot machine Fractional-reserve banking Social Credit Corporation Financial analyst Corporate finance Investment bank Health insurance National Insurance Taxation in the United States Electronic commerce Debt levels and flows Credit history Asian financial crisis Hearsay Letter of credit Password Personal finance Corporate social responsibility Economy of the United States Sarbanes-Oxley Act Skype Mortgage-backed security Credit union Windows XP Derivative (finance) Hyperinflation World Bank Group Gold standard Windows 2000 Toronto-Dominion Bank Mutual fund College admissions Debt consolidation Auto insurance Economy of India GNU General Public License Mainframe computer Monetary policy Great Depression Islamic economics Privatization Health care in the United States Social welfare Usury Business performance management Open Directory Project Soci__t__ G__n__rale Privacy Public domain Administrative law of the United States

what is the best way to deal with credit cards that have been written off any personal experiences do you contact any organizations or is it better to just ride it out i've heard that if you contact the collection agencies after a certain amount of time that it resets the clock in terms of how long they can harass you for i'd prefer personal experiences rather than negative insults or judgements i know i screwed up and i'm trying to fix it thank you if you just contact the collection agencies it will not reset any clocks what will reset the clock is if you make a written promise to pay or actually make a payment they can never harass you but they can make reasonable attempt to collect the debt until it is paid if they do harrass you they could be in violation of the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa you could then turn around and sue them for the violation a negative item can only be reported for years from the date of the negative item so for charge offs that is years from the date of the last delinquency if you have passed that date it can no appear on your credit report there is another time limit called the statute of limitations this varies by state but is between years for credit card debt once you are outside of this they can no longer take any legal action sue to get you to pay if you are no where near either of these you will first want to send them a request to validate the debt by certified mail they have days to do this and if they do not you can have it removed from your credit report if they do validate the debt you should negociate with them that if you pay off the account they will remove the colllection account do this by mail making sure you list the amount to be paid and the dates it is to be paid on do not send them any money until you have a written aggrement from them as to the amount and that they will remove the information  Bond Credit card Article One of the United States Constitution Contract Child support Annuity United States Postal Service Fair Game (Scientology) Appeal Plame affair Surveillance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Credit repair E-mail spam Taxation in the United States Daylight saving time Microeconomics Animal Crossing Credit score Student loan Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Supreme Court of the United States Estoppel Copyright Social Security (United States) Copyright law of the United Kingdom Internet fraud Health insurance Mail fraud Legal tender Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 FairTax Drug test Betting (poker) Trust (Law) USA Monetary policy Life insurance Postage stamp GNU General Public License Insurance Minimum wage Corporation Money Poker jargon USA PATRIOT Act Interest Tax protester Octopus card Derivative (finance) Bank fraud Personal finance Tom DeLay Gold standard Stopping e-mail abuse United States Constitution 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Data retention Spam (electronic) Deflation (economics) Fiat money Electronic toll collection 1995 Quebec referendum Debt 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Trade union Public domain Deprogramming Economy of the United States Security (finance) SCO-Linux controversies Mail Administrative law of the United States Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Blackjack Constitution Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Divorce Public-key cryptography Slander and libel Credit card fraud Schabir Shaik Trial Government debt Pirate decryption Bank Public transport Gmail Debt levels and flows

debt collector coming to home when i was younger i made some stupid mistakes that i am paying for now long story short i had a judgement against me for a credit card and they ended up levying my bank account of dollars and the debt was since then i have received no notification from the collector today however a man came to my house asking for me he approached my brother and said that he was with the court house and from about feet away he showed my brother some badge my mom came out to talk to this person and asked him what this was in reference to he said this was about a judgement that was against me and that i never showed to court and that he wanted to talk to me about that my mom asked him if he was a marshall and to show some identification well magically he didn't have any badge or business cards on him who is this person and in the state of california can debbt collectors come to your home please only serious answers and i'm aware this is what i get so spare any lectures tx he wasn't there to serve me anything he said it was in reference to something that has been served to me before in that i didnt show up to court which why should that matter i was already in default thus they were able to levy my account ps the first time i was served it wasnt even to me it was to my brothers girlfriend who i once worked with they served them to her since she said she knew me but i didnt work for the company any longer it sounds to me like a collector trying to scare you into getting the additional money owed since they already filed a judgement and levied your bank account chances are they will not sue you again for the remaining amount if you don't have a bank account of course they are unable to levy you again if you do have an employer they cannot have your wages garnished unless the original judgement says to do so often times when its a bank account levy it cannot be an either or situation meaning they cannot levy your account or garnish wages next time you see this person tell him to stay away from you or you will scream its illegal to be harassed at your home or work if he comes close to you scream i'm pretty certain he will run  Credit card Contract Taxation in the United States Bank Schabir Shaik Trial Monetary policy Child support Mortgage Plame affair Legal tender Apple Computer Personal finance Deflation (economics) Shaggy dog story Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bank fraud Student loan Wyatt Earp Enron Corporation Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Tax Social Security (United States) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Article One of the United States Constitution United Kingdom corporation tax FairTax Minimum wage Debt Corporation Money Trust (Law) USA Identity theft Hyperinflation Fred Phelps Blackjack Password Satchel Paige Government debt Charles Ponzi Tom DeLay Great Depression EastEnders Divorce Paula Jones Insolvency Wheel of Fortune Economy of the United States Payroll Economy of Russia Bretton Woods system Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Wal-Mart Identity document Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Small business Cardcaptor Sakura Derivative (finance) SCO-Linux controversies Bond Social rule Citigroup Time Out of Mind Roe v.

can you call your credit card co and tell them to switch you to a different card if you call amex discover capitalone etc etc and tell them that you're not happy with your current card and want a better one from their selection being that you're their customer is it possible for them to switch you to another card they carry if you qualify for one they will do card conversions as long as you qualify for the card you are requesting length of time you had the card is really not much of a factor many people have converted cards almost as soon as being approved for one card i wouldn't recommend saying you are not happy with your current card or use the word better when asking about conversion simply state that your current card is not what you really want and you would like to convert to whatever card for example you have the amex delta gold which has an annual fee you might call and ask if you can convert to either the blue blue cash or clear if you really don't know what card you want then you might ask the csr what cards you would qualify to convert to specify that you do not want a card with annual fees and that doesn't report credit limits if that particular csr says it's not possible call back and speak to another there are a few csr's that either don't know much about conversion or don't want to bother doing it when i converted one of my cards it took less than a minute for me to request it and for the csr to convert it then the csr spent the next or minutes explaining the details of the new card if you have a charge card and not a credit card you may find it a bit difficult to convert to a credit card  Credit card Sears Holdings Corporation Plame affair Analog-to-digital converter Secure Digital card Identity theft Debit card Extreme Programming GSM services X86 assembly language EFTPOS Telephone exchange Musical Instrument Digital Interface American Express Citigroup Surveillance Ocean's Twelve High-voltage direct current Password The Amazing Race Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Gross domestic product Credit card fraud Internet fraud Consensus decision-making Betting (poker) United States House of Representatives Automatic teller machine Corporate social responsibility Octopus card Time Out of Mind Digital-to-analog converter Identity document Draw poker Virgin Mobile Credit score Wal-Mart Interest Transport in Hong Kong Customs and etiquette of Japan National Football League PlayStation Portable Electrophysiology Driver's license PGA Tour Financial audit Religious conversion Skype Digital Beetle in an Anthill Universal Serial Bus Sound Blaster Graduate school Yu-Gi-Oh!

will cancelling my amex hurt my credit score i currently have credit cards after a bankrupcy two years ago in jan amex is one of them it has an unlimited line being that part of our score is based on debt to credit limit ratio would cancelling this card with its unlimited credit line hurt my score and if so by how much closing a credit card won't necessarily hurt your score but it generally does hurt most folks scores and it will never help if it's an amex charge card like a green one that you must pay in full each month those are supposed to get coded as a charge card and won't get figured into your credit card utilization however that's not always the case if yours is reporting as a credit card rather than a charge card i'd give amex customer service and politely ask to talk to someone about your card and the way it's being reported to the credit bureaus but when you call appear lost and ask for help hi umm ah i'm not really sure who to talk to about this umm can you help me people have an inherent desire to wanna help it empowers them they tend to let down their guard and be more receptive to any request simply because you were nice and you asked if it's an amex green or gold rewards then you're probably getting zinged you with an annual fee cards that are costing you money are worth getting rid of however amex tends to be very generous issuing card holders more cards and they can be very generous with credit line increases  Credit card Annuity Money Mutual fund Microeconomics Student loan Credit score Mortgage Credit card fraud Hearts (game) Insurance H-1B visa Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Debt Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Blackjack Bank Inflation Octopus card Tax Futures contract Public domain Interest Bond Auto insurance Plame affair Micropayment Virgin Mobile Consensus decision-making Taxation in the United States Copyleft Monopoly (game) Wal-Mart United Kingdom corporation tax Internet fraud Driver's license Personal finance Betting (poker) Surveillance Debit card Poker jargon British national identity card GNU General Public License Pittsburgh Steelers Short selling Citigroup United States Postal Service Immigration to the United States FairTax Ra (board game) MMORPG Athenian democracy Intellectual property Capitalism America Online Animal Crossing Luas Extreme Programming Oyster card Social Security (United States) American Express Ice hockey United States House of Representatives Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Mahjong Property (ownership right) Mainframe computer Public good Predatory lending Identity document Cable television Trademark Primerica Financial Services MTV Legal tender Overclocking Financial services Corporate finance MetroCard Sports betting Verizon Wireless Baseball Gross domestic product Medicare (Canada) Wheel of Fortune SCO-Linux controversies $ale of the Century Financial audit Identity theft Contract bridge U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Economy of Russia Broadband Internet access Babylonian law

what is the lowest possible fixed apr you can get for a credit card i talking about excellent credit with atleast five years of credit history no blemishes what soever and someone with a high credit rating i am just kind of wondering what kind of offers does good credit get you especially compared to people with bad credit what kind of apr can you get with bad credit overdue accounts in the history poor credit and a short credit history i am just curious as to how much of an advantage is it to have a good credit history your results will vary but the better your credit the better your offers may be i have seen the uneducated accept higher offers than their credit merits i have seen well know cards where the apr varies from to sometimes it is for a limited number of months and then will rise if you are lucky the low rate may apply to the life of the loan if you are careful to obey all the rules woe to those who do not i have seen offers under apr for so so credit rated folks i have seen a lot worse offers too warning many cards have a fee up front up to on top of the above whatever you do read all information and credit terms carefully assuming you can sleep on it and read again before acting  Credit card Student loan Bank Poker jargon Predatory lending Mortgage Citigroup Grade (education) National Certificate of Educational Achievement Education in the United States Betting (poker) Annuity Cheating in poker Refinancing Bond Interest Microcredit Theory of conduct Deflation (economics) Octopus card Life insurance Monetary policy Taxation in the United States Annual percentage rate Minimum wage Payday loan Lunar phase Insurance Credit history Unemployment Microeconomics Credit score ELO rating system Education in the People's Republic of China Stud poker United Kingdom corporation tax Supply and demand Gold standard ATI Technologies Growth hormone treatment Rule of St Benedict Blackjack Capital accumulation Identity theft Cable television Price discrimination Draw poker Virgin Mobile Debt consolidation Inflation Hand (poker) Social rule Certificate of deposit Helium Community card poker Fiat money Usury Graduate school Jet engine Arbitrage MP3 Card game Contract bridge Pai gow poker Floppy disk Nuclear fusion Debt Central processing unit Tuition College admissions Economy of Pakistan Big Two Labour economics Top-up fees Education Driver's license Slot machine Bretton Woods system Free trade Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief SAT Public policy Hearts (game) Publicly funded medicine Goodness and value theory Apprenticeship Beatmania IIDX Canasta Bank fraud Credit repair Internet fraud FairTax Principal-agent problem Heather Wilson Fast bowling Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Money Small business Renewable energy development Keynesian economics

under around and through before but those would be buyers just fell short of the mark tip get pre qualified with a reputable lender just for hell of it see what you can afford to buy right now today this minute at least you ll have a pretty good idea what you can afford or if there are credit issues you must take care of before you start looking you should know what they are and how to manage them tip b ask the lender what you can do to raise your credit rating tip you want to qualify for a fixed rate positive amortization mortgage don t go for any negative amortization mortgage when you sit down with the mortgage officer ask him her to explain the different mortgage types to you there are many types in fact you should find out about the different mortgage types before you sit down with the lender tip what ever the outcome of tip please don t ever co sign for anyone at any time for any reason for any amount this is one of the fastest way to knock yourself out of contention tip a you may want to consider hiring and paying an agent to work exclusively with you for you and represent your buying interests it s a thought which deserves considering and looking into tip b if you are

costs and an approximate monthly payment hopefully you will see how things begin fitting into place and the pieces of the home buying jigsaw puzzle begin falling into place you should have a much clearer picture tip d ask for copies of all the documents you will see be exposed to and will be expected to sign when you are ready to submit an offer or buy your first home buying a home is an extremely emotional time having all the necessary documents and knowing what is in those documents ahead of time could make life a lot less stressful when it comes time to sign on the dotted line tip e please do your best to stick with that agent if you see an ad in the paper or on line or you drive by and see a sign or if someone tells you about a property call that agent to get all the necessary info for you that agent can get that information a lot easier than you can don t make any calls and leave your name with any one you have a trusted agent he she will do his her best for you shouldn t

what to do i have two credit cards with id fraud help i have two credit cards mint and capital one both have been used with out my knowledge or agreement i only found this out when statements arrived neither credit card company will freeze the interest on the cards i have informed police who are unable to assist me because since april it must be the card company who report's it to the police not sure where to turn next as it seems i am liable for this money any advice thanks xx this is uk card issue thanks for help so far guys i had a similar problem with a visa debit card from lloyds tsb as soon as i saw the statement they had taken euros cash from a bank in milan i called the fraud department and they sorted it out very efficiently and immediately with just two phone calls they called me back to verify my identity they needed to know of course that i hadn't been in italy and that i still had the card it had been cloned but they were quite happy to verify this verbally on the phone which surprised me identity theft and card cloning is unfortunately very common and the safest thing is to make sure that the card never leaves your sight this is one reason why chip and pin is safer than swipe and sign i also had a problem with a credit card transaction online where i never received the goods again this was dealt with swiftly and efficiently by a call to the card company the first call should be to the card company and you should find a number for their fraud department either on the card on the agreement or online hopefully the fraudulent transactions should show some anomaly not goods you normally purchase not purchased from a place where you were or something like that nevertheless card fraud is something that they deal with regularly and they should be able to freeze the card and cancel and refund the amounts and the charges quickly and routinely both companies are reputable ones i believe and i am surprised that you have had problems i suggest that you call them again with all the facts that you can lay your hands on especially any circumstances that you can remember where the cards might have been cloned or left your person without your knowledge  EFTPOS Credit card fraud Octopus card Chip and PIN Surveillance Bank fraud Internet fraud Automatic teller machine Electronic money Identity theft Contract British national identity card Plame affair RFID Smart card Schabir Shaik Trial Money Insurance Identity document Microeconomics Enron Corporation Bank Euro Advance fee fraud Password United Kingdom corporation tax Loyalty program 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Spyware Fraud Mail fraud Mergers and acquisitions Privacy Poker jargon Gold standard Interac Legal tender Passport Corporation Electronic commerce Phishing IBM PC compatible Electronic voting Two-factor authentication United States dollar Slot machine Life insurance Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Tax Betting (poker) Wachovia Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Anonymity Skype Consensus decision-making Corporate governance Intellectual property Vodafone Spam (electronic) Have I Got News For You Aldi Jean Charles de Menezes Mortgage Public-key cryptography Phone fraud Florida Central Voter File Marshall Plan Timeline of the Enron scandal Data retention AMD David Beckham Citigroup Ocean's Twelve Canadian dollar Punch card MetroCard SCO-Linux controversies SmartRider Baccarat Monetary policy Grand Theft Auto III Commodore 64 Tom DeLay Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus EMV Minimum wage National identification number Draw poker Emergency telephone number Stock Annuity Personal finance Islamic banking Mutual fund Cheque

how long do credit scores stay down due to inquiry if you do not get approved for the loan i applied for a credit card but got denied my credit score went down inquiries are reported for years from the date of the inquiry however in terms of scoring it only effects it for year with most of the negative hit in the first months it is not the fact that you got declined that causes the effect the inquiry would have the same effect even if you were approved you did not say how much it dropped but if this was your only recent inquiry your score should not have dropped more than a few points which can easily be made up if your score dropped dramatically or more there is probably something else that caused the drop  Credit score Student loan Credit history Deflation (economics) National Certificate of Educational Achievement Identity theft Credit card 1995 Quebec referendum Contract bridge Billboard Hot 100 Asian financial crisis Toronto Computer Leasing Inquiry Bond Grade (education) SAT West Bromwich Albion F.C.

should i cancel my capital one credit card because it doesnt report your credit limit before you say no because canceling a credit card shortens your credit history and lowers your score listen to this i have a capital one credit card no other credit cards or loans or anything it is all that is on my report it was my first card ever so it has a dollar limit and interest rate ive had it almost a year with this alone and nothing else on my report i now have a i talked to an advisor at my credit union and he told me i need to get rid of my capital one since they dont report your credit limit to the agencies it negatively affects your credit he said my score should be around but since the dont report the credit limit it is lower i was approved for a credit union credit card at no fees so should i go ahead and keep the capital one and have the longer history or get the card that actually reports my limits has lower rates and dump the capital one or should i get both then use the capital one every so often the reason it is important for them to report the limit is because if there isnt one reported even if i only owe dollars the report can guess that i have a limit when i only have a limit this is how it works against me if non reporting is your only reason then do not cancel capital one has recently seen the light and is changing their policy from washington post aug capital one financial based in mclean va says it will now report all cardholders' credit limits to the three national credit bureaus a capital one spokeswoman tatiana stead told me recently that the company made the decision to report credit limits because like any policy that our customers may have concerns about we constantly re evaluate our practices the change already under way is expected to be completed by the end of this year she added other reasons not to cancel is the aging helps and though it is relatively small it does help your credit utilization which is a significant portion of your fico score  Credit score Credit card Student loan Bank Insurance Monetary policy Taxation in the United States Citigroup United Kingdom corporation tax Economy of Russia Mortgage Life insurance Bond Credit rating agency Wal-Mart Debt Predatory lending Euro Money Microeconomics Government debt Bretton Woods system Inflation Economy of Pakistan Minimum wage Kyoto Protocol Mergers and acquisitions Plame affair Bank of China (Hong Kong) Financial services Annuity FairTax Microcredit Social Security (United States) Corporate finance Gold standard Octopus card Deflation (economics) Target Corporation Economy of the United States Primerica Financial Services Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Capital accumulation Food and Drug Administration Interest Credit history Trade union Credit card fraud Privatization Poker jargon American Express Investment bank Cable television Short selling Extreme Programming Anarchist economics Fox News Education in the People's Republic of China Credit union Normal distribution Mutual fund Debt consolidation Corporate governance Security (finance) Wachovia Economy of Chile Free trade America Online Sears Holdings Corporation Education in the United States Marshall Plan Enron Corporation Cooperative Reliability engineering Internet fraud Hyperinflation Auto insurance Derivative (finance) George W.

can i use my debit card as credit when there's a positive balance in my bank account but not enough to cover what i need to get in other words will it be approved by the credit card reader i know i can't push debit because that's automatically posted as long as there's a positive balance and then i can put the money in later or will it deny me i need groceries and it's a few days before payday sometimes these things happen i have no credit cards by the way i know they're evil yes i know i'm running the risk of getting charged in an overdraft fee but when your kid needs food it's worth it right i just want to know if since there is a positive balance it will go through or should i just write a check if it goes through your bank will charge you an overdraft fee this all depends if they allow it or not most of the times they do in what they say is a convenience to the customer and while it is a convenience it is also a big money maker for them if you do this be sure to do it in one purchase and not multiple because every transaction that occurs while you are overdrawn will incurr the overdraft fee so it would be better to do transaction for than transactions for each btw it is not true that when you do credit it is never posted right away it depends on the merchant you are shopping at and how they process the payments some do it offline or in batch mode and they don't get posted for a day but most are real time especially your major chain stores  Credit card Bank Automatic teller machine Octopus card Money Internet fraud Electronic money Loyalty program Mutual fund Surveillance Cheque Predatory lending Insurance Bank fraud Electronic commerce Short selling SmartRider Automated Clearing House Interac Smart card Monetary policy Oyster card MetroCard Double-entry book-keeping Microeconomics Mergers and acquisitions Mortgage Filling station Password Tesco Micropayment Online shop Financial services Schabir Shaik Trial Sears Holdings Corporation Chip and PIN Islamic banking United States Postal Service Advance fee fraud Capital accumulation Citigroup Supermarket Personal finance E-ZPass Payday loan Money supply Gold standard RFID Electronic toll collection Betting (poker) Aldi Legal tender Blackjack Wal-Mart MapleStory Wachovia Economy of Chile Annuity Credit score Stored-value card London Underground Neopets Accountancy Usury Economy of India Derivative (finance) Poker jargon Corporate finance Debt ACID Tax Scrip EMV Euro Student loan Mainframe computer E-mail spam Auto insurance Windows XP Bank of China (Hong Kong) Slot machine Deflation (economics) Interest Extreme Programming Microcredit Life insurance Certificate of deposit Surplus value Screenplay Payroll American Express Steam (content delivery) Intellectual property Wall Street

could anyone tell me how will the subprime problem affect private equity private equity fund thanks it all depends if that particular fund has exposure to sub prime prime or other mortgages or companies that have exposures to those markets private equity is simply interested in buying out distressed companies and turning them around to sell for a profit it's very unlikely with the current market conditions that any pe firms are shopping for companies that are currently imploding if the pe firm is exposed to builders developers mortgage companies cdo's or condos then i would assume they will have a problem if they are private equity specializing in a different industry they might not be as affected by the sub prime but can be exposed to general market conditions  Mortgage Hedge fund Security (finance) Investment bank Venture capital Private equity Bond Financial services Carlyle Group Life insurance Mergers and acquisitions Lehman Brothers Debt Predatory lending Federal National Mortgage Association Stock market Stock Collateralized debt obligation Derivative (finance) Monetary policy Corporate finance Housing cooperative Construction Equity investment Futures contract Free trade Active management Wells Fargo Ford Motor Company Economy of Nigeria Primerica Financial Services Capital accumulation Finance Temasek Holdings Privatization Asian financial crisis Soci__t__ G__n__rale Goldman Sachs Real estate bubble Microeconomics Bank Pharmaceutical company Natural monopoly Economy of Russia Mutual fund Institutional fund management Mortgage-backed security Gold as an investment Externality Donald Trump Cost of capital Health insurance Citigroup Public good Economy of Chile Annuity General Motors Electro-Motive Division Stock market index Criticisms of socialism Publicly funded medicine Toronto-Dominion Bank Advertising Weighted average cost of capital NASDAQ Morgan Stanley Economy of South Africa Real estate Economy of Iceland Long-Term Capital Management JPMorgan Chase & Co.

i just paid off credit cards do i leave them open or close them immediately to help my credit score i wouldn't be putting anything on them i was just told it can help your credit score to keep them open for a while and not put anything on them i just wanted to make sure this was good advice because i hear so much about people closing their accounts everybody's telling you to leave them open i'm going to tell you why you should leave them open this is what makes up your credit score payment history total debt vs avaiable credit length of time establishing credit types of credit established inquiries and new accounts ok now when you close an account it immediately affects whatever active payment history you have will be shortened it also shortens the average age of accounts if these accounts have been opened for a while and then to close them would give the appearance later on that credit has been established more recently than it has closing accounts also disrupts the mixture of revolving vs installment accounts you can't load up on one type of account an example of a balanced mixture of credit is revolving credit cards line of credit and installment student furniture appliance car boat motorcycle mortage accounts and more importantly closing accounts decreases the amount of avialble credit vs the amount of debt that you have making it look like you owe more than you're capable of borrowing if you have in debt from other accounts beside credit cards and you close the credit card accounts you don't have that available credit to offset the total debt you owe the best suggestion would be to keep the accounts open and make small purchases month or so that can be paid off every month to show activity this way the balance stays low if not at and the card continues to report positive activity every month  Student loan Bank Mortgage Monetary policy Debt Schabir Shaik Trial Credit history Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Government debt Deflation (economics) Bretton Woods system Interest Internet fraud Betting (poker) Gold standard Short selling Surveillance Finance Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Personal finance United Kingdom corporation tax Baccarat Double-entry book-keeping Poker jargon Economy of Russia Money Mutual fund Microeconomics Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Debt levels and flows Supply and demand Arbitrage Euro Measures of national income and output Great Depression Credit card fraud Insurance Social Security (United States) Primerica Financial Services FairTax Octopus card Identity theft Money supply Tax Economy of the United States Islamic banking Bank fraud The Amazing Race Cheque Hyperinflation Annuity Collateralized debt obligation SmartRider Economy of Pakistan EFTPOS Taxation in the United States Economy of the Philippines Derivative (finance) Electrophysiology Citigroup Accounting methods Equine conformation Futures contract Inflation Plame affair Elevator Corporate finance Arthur Laffer Pension Economy of Bolivia Security (finance) History of the United States (1918-1945) Debt consolidation Estoppel U.S. public debt Smart card $ale of the Century Wind power Refinancing Economy of El Salvador George W.

does anyone know how i can remove capital one from my credit report i had a capital one card in it is now charge off the card was initially for i have all sorts of fees over the year that added up to i have been dispting this because it's not correct but it seams like everytime i dispute it it comes back remains i want to work with them but since it has been on my report for almost five years i was told to leave it alone i really need help i need a higher credit score so that i can get a home can i get some help from someone please it would have been cheaper to pay ther card on time a month is better than having all this mess you have created once it is on your credit report as a charge off you are not going to get it off legitimately you can get it off but you have to be willing to dispute the thing with lies until someone makes a mistake and it comes off i have done this and here is how it works the credit bureaus have days in which to verify a disputed item this means contacting the creditor to ascertain that the item is correct if for some reason they do not get a response back from the creditor within the required time then they have to remove the item from your credit report you may have to do this with experian trans union and equifax if capital one reports to all three equifax is the hardest what you do is this send a handwritten dispute to the credit bureau stating that the negative item is not yours that you never had a capital one credit card that it has to belong to someone else with the same name and that you have never been late with any payments even though none of this is true you have to say it and if the credit bureau cannot verify the accuracy of the item then it must come off it might take a couple of years to do this but it can be done if you keep at it i know this works because i have done it you will have to send the same disputes over and over again about once every days until someone slips up it's easier and cheaper though just to pay your bills on time the negative item will remain on your credit report for years after it is paid years is incorrect bankruptcy stay for years and some federal tax liens stay on forever if not paid  Credit score Credit repair TransUnion Credit card Mortgage Insurance Bond United Kingdom corporation tax Plame affair Student loan Article One of the United States Constitution Surveillance Deflation (economics) Social Security (United States) Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Debt consolidation Minimum wage Phishing Legal tender Probation officer Estoppel Tom DeLay Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Internet fraud Octopus card Annuity Airline Bank Enron Corporation Economy of Russia 401(k) Money Credit card fraud Flat tax Wal-Mart Concurrent estate Life insurance Experian Killian documents Advance fee fraud FairTax Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Bankruptcy Government debt Health insurance Microeconomics Data retention Child support London Congestion Charge Mutual fund Islamic banking Fractional-reserve banking British national identity card Topps Automatic teller machine Bankruptcy in the United States Debt Voluntary Student Unionism Euro Evan Mecham Appeal The Amazing Race Government of India Act 1935 Inflation Dog training Bank fraud Commodity markets Corporation Blackjack Timeline of the Enron scandal RFID Bretton Woods system Algorithm Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Allodial title Solar cell Mao (game) Fast bowling GSM services Snooker Something Awful Financial audit Electricity meter SAT Punch card Credit history Food and Drug Administration IP (complexity) Florida Central Voter File Donald Trump Public-key cryptography Predatory lending Washington gubernatorial election, 2004

i'm hesistant to check my credit score because i heard it will affect my score is this true or not as with all things credit this issue is a hell of a lot more complicated than people think it is and there is a lot of misinformation floating around about this you are going to have to read this carefully as it gets very complex ok first of all you can get both hard and soft inquiries a soft inquiry occurs when you check your credit yourself this can be done directly via the credit bureau's although you would have to do it seperate times one for each bureau you can also do this via myfico com freecreditreport com etc however there are a few problems with this these companies are out to sell you all kinds of crap you don't need they are constantly bombarding you trying to get you to buy all kinds of non sense products things such as indetity theft protection which is something you do not need the credit scores that they give you are fako's and not fico's which are the real credit scores that lenders use you could get your fako and then apply for a mortgage and be really shocked by how much higher lower your fako is compared to your real fico there are hard inquiries which are done by auto dealers mortgage company's credit card companies and others these kind of inquiries can and do reduce your fico who knows what they do to fako ha and decrease can be any place between about points depending on a very wide variety of other factors the average is about points or so ok finally i will end by busting a widely held myth people claim that you can run your credit for the purposes of getting a mortgage for a period of days and have it not decrease your credit score this can be true but is usually not true and is just a selling point that mortgage brokers and bankers use to sell loans the thing is this mortgage companies run their credit via a rd party company the rd party companies takes data for all of the bureau's and merge them into what is called a tri merged report this is the grand daddy of them all and this is what mortgage lenders use and this is considered your most complete and accurate credit report this is also the only place where you can get your real credit scores ok there is some software that can be used that will put the day rule mentioned above into effect soft ware used by the rd party companies however it cost thousands and thousands of dollars to buy this soft ware and the vast majority of rd party companies either can not afford it or just do no wish to buy it because it is too costly as such most of the time when you run your credit for a mortage your fico will decrease i hope this helps  Mortgage Insurance Credit score Predatory lending Bond Blackjack Illegal drug trade Life insurance Deflation (economics) Citigroup Capitalism Bank Debt Capital accumulation Supply and demand Short selling Identity theft Student loan Microeconomics Inflation Mergers and acquisitions Mutual fund Title insurance Arguments for and against drug prohibition Primerica Financial Services Surplus value Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Central processing unit Credit card History of the United States (1918-1945) Surveillance Gold standard Islamic banking Grand Theft Auto (game) Wood FairTax Taxation in the United States Bulk vending Poker jargon Bretton Woods system Donald Trump Model (economics) Intellectual property Annuity Federal National Mortgage Association Redundant array of independent disks Flat tax Derivative (finance) Construction CPU design Annual percentage rate Public-key cryptography Finance Central bank Digital photography Internet fraud Money supply Hyperinflation Appeal Hard disk Economy of Russia Government National Mortgage Association Microcredit Asian financial crisis Hearts (game) TransUnion Interest Auto insurance Warez Pornography MP3 Floppy disk Economic inequality Reliability engineering Great Depression Economy of the United States Subsidy Mach kernel Yield curve Theory of conduct Credit history Tesco Law of value Sears Holdings Corporation Explosive material RISC Baccarat Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bank fraud Personal finance Call centre Ford Motor Company

so i cleaned up my credit reports and im still being denied credit and my score hasnt increased why i have some charge offs on there from a time when i was out of work on medical ive paid em off and they changed it all to pays as agreed and its positive on my reports now nothing negative showing on my report now so how come my score has not increased and im being denied credit how long does this take i paid everything off this past may congratulations on taking care of those badd accounts the only thing is that by taking care of that you only stopped the bleeding which is only the battle what i mean is that you have to have active accounts constantly reporting in order to build credit do you have any open accounts that you're paying on time if the answer is no then that's the problem and you mentioned that you're not able to get credit then i have a couple of tips to help you get build credit without getting declined first you might want to check where you do your banking to see if secured credit cards are offered a good way of decscribing it would be building credit with a savings account because that's bascially how it works a deposit that's usually tied to a savings account is placed upfront as collateral to establish a credit line in the same amount for example you put up a deposit then you'd get a credit line while the deposit wouldn't be used to pay for whatever's charged on the card unless it was sent to collections and charged off it does gain interest while you're building credit more importantly it helps to increase the limit by adding to the deposit often because it looks good to have a high limit on your credit cards when it reports some tips to make it easy to take care of the card are spend no more than month pay it off in full and repeat the process you want to keep the balance at the bare minimum or at if possible usually after a year of paying on time and keeping the balance low or at the card either converts to a regular card or a better card's offered altogether by that time offers for more credit should start coming again but i would suggest opening up another secured card so to minimize your chances of getting declined repeat the process using the deposit from the first card and add even more to it to increase the credit line this way at least you have major credit cards and then you'd need just one department store cards in order to build positive credit also what you can do is enroll with prbc prbc is america's alternative credit bureau providing a helpful service to the over million people with limited or no credit history if you pay your monthly bills on time prbc can help you build credit to qualify for a mortgage and better interest rates on time payments for the following bills are not reported to the traditional credit bureaus rent cable phone daycare insurance electric natural gas cell phone the only time your payments for these bills are reported to the other credit bureaus is if they're missing or late with prbc your on time payments count you build credit for paying your bills on time even if you have no credit history prbc offers two simple ways to start building credit today hopefully these tips will help you i've also posted links to prbc and several secured credit card companies good luck  Bank Mortgage Life insurance Bond Credit score Internet fraud Octopus card Surveillance Student loan Money Poker jargon Annuity Personal finance Mutual fund Taxation in the United States Insurance Debt Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Economy of the United States Social Security (United States) Monetary policy FairTax Economy of Russia Filling station Betting (poker) Deflation (economics) Blackjack Citigroup Security (finance) Primerica Financial Services Gross domestic product Gas metal arc welding Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Certificate of deposit Derivative (finance) Capitalism Health insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Capital accumulation Tom DeLay Neopets Food Stamp Program Schabir Shaik Trial Short selling Gold standard Identity theft Publicly funded medicine New Deal GSM services Password Cable television 401(k) Debit card Broadband Internet access Contract bridge Money supply Social Security debate (United States) Wal-Mart Economy of the Philippines Economy of India Public transport Bretton Woods system Microcredit Education in the United States Credit history Tesco Bank of America Craps Kyoto Protocol Baccarat Health savings account Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Tax Internal ballistics Economic inequality Spam (electronic) Copyleft Electrophysiology Economy of the Republic of Ireland Minimum wage MTR Ponzi scheme United States Postal Service Medicare (United States) Plame affair Futures contract Islamic banking

how do credit cards work then eh i don't know fu ck all about credit card me how do the credit card companies make money is there a monthly yearly charge is there a payback interest rate do the shops where you can use it have to pay a commision it's bloody mad how does it work then eh its not quite that mad a credit card is basically an agreement between you and your lender saying they trust you at any one time to borrow whatever the limit on your card is without having to go through the faff of sorting out a loan each time you want to make a purchase broadly speaking the more they trust you the more you can borrow as mentioned above the two main ways companies make money is through interest charges on a monthly basis on the balance outstanding on your card and through transaction charges the latter isn't as constant accross cards as a lot of the infrastructure is owned by certain lenders so margins are different particularly for smaller credit card companies in some cases there may also be a monthly service charge for the credit card account this may be particularly the case if its a business card or a card with a very high limit if you are not stupid then a credit card can be a perfectly useful consumer tool it allows you to help build up a positive credit history it gives you more protection under the cca than using a debit card when making purchases and it is often a good way of buying expensive things all of which you can do and repay your balance before any interest is charged indeed even if you use it and have to repay the interest it can still be useful the key is to know what you can afford to repay before you buy  Credit card Mortgage Bank Predatory lending Debt Monetary policy Short selling Debit card United Kingdom corporation tax Islamic banking Bond Stock Finance Interest Student loan Citigroup Bank fraud Usury Personal finance Government debt Economy of India Financial services Schabir Shaik Trial Credit history Money Microeconomics Gross domestic product Financial markets Life insurance Privatization Octopus card Internet fraud Deflation (economics) Credit card fraud Money supply Microcredit Primerica Financial Services Economy of Pakistan Electronic commerce Supply and demand EFTPOS Tax Mutual fund Bretton Woods system Automatic teller machine Lender of last resort Gold standard Corporate finance Capitalism History of the United States (1918-1945) Inflation Refinancing Sears Holdings Corporation Economics 401(k) Debt consolidation Hyperinflation Economy of the United States Surveillance Poker jargon Repurchase agreement Value added tax Annual percentage rate Leasing Great Depression Real estate broker Mergers and acquisitions Economy of Russia Price discrimination Auto insurance U.S. public debt Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Betting (poker) Double-entry book-keeping Central bank Rational pricing Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Free trade Payday loan Social Security (United States) New Deal Islamic economics Municipal bond Toll road Electronic money Hire purchase Small business Consensus decision-making Online shop Supply-side economics Irish Life and Permanent Estoppel

if i am trying to re establish my credit and my mom adds me to her card as an auth user will it help me what will it do to my credit score and what will the creditors look at the first poster is wrong they will not look at your mothers credit report they cannot legally pull your mothers credit report unless she is the one who applies for credit with them being an au used to help people with their scores starting next month fico will start removing au's from their scoring system the only thing that may help in being an au now is when the creditor pulls your reports and sees that account being reported and takes that account into consideration and if the card holder wants to allow the au to be able to use the card without having to add them as a joint holder it's hard to say at this time since this is new territory all anyone can really do at this point is make guesses on how creditors will react  Credit score Credit card Octopus card United Kingdom corporation tax Bond Identity theft Tom DeLay Public-key cryptography Mortgage Hearts (game) Extreme Programming Copyleft Israeli settlement MAME Concurrent estate Phishing Money OpenBSD Trademark Contract bridge Debt SmartRider Estoppel U.S. generally accepted accounting principles Cheque Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Canasta Driver's license Mao (game) Deflation (economics) Credit repair Professional wrestling holds The Sims 2 Winning Streak Debit card Bank Copy protection Indian nationality law GNU General Public License National identification number Password Euchre Spades DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act America Online Dominoes Internet fraud Cindy Sheehan Pseudonymity Spam (electronic) Bank fraud Thai royal and noble titles Grade (education) Surveillance DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Debt bondage Fractional-reserve banking LiveJournal Digital rights management Mumia Abu-Jamal Xbox Live TransUnion Password cracking Kimi Finster Windows 2000 Fair Isaac Corporation President (game) Ice hockey North Staffordshire Railway Plame affair The Price Is Right Mainframe computer Whose Line Is It Anyway?

my credit score is a and i want to get a gas credit card any suggestions no dollar limit need at least a dollar limit you don't need a card strictly for gas the pumps usually accept any card have you joined a credit union they will tell you what you qualify for if it isn't initially you can build up a better credit rating with them over time and they will raise your limit don't take on too much debt a a month gas bill is too much sounds like you need to change your driving habits unless you do it as part of your job and get reimbursed each month gas is not a long term investment like a car or a house so your gas bill should be paid off every month with most cards you will avoid paying any interest if you do that if you don't you end up paying a lot more for the gas than what it says at the pump  Filling station United Kingdom corporation tax Student loan Debt Bank Kyoto Protocol Insurance Temasek Holdings Government debt Minimum wage Economy of Russia Interest FairTax Money Legal tender Capital accumulation Euro Bond Social Security (United States) Short selling Bretton Woods system Inflation Predatory lending Tom DeLay Credit score Karl Rove Personal finance History of the United States (1918-1945) Reaganomics Toll road Road pricing Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Yield curve Primerica Financial Services Auto insurance Economy of the United States Supply-side economics United States dollar Plame affair Hydrogen economy Hyperinflation Deflation (economics) Article One of the United States Constitution Credit union Debt consolidation Identity theft Professional wrestling slang Advance fee fraud Pump It Up Dividend Betting (poker) Economy of Mexico Food Stamp Program Siphon Driver's license Fiat money Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Slot machine Great Depression Economy of Pakistan Beltway sniper attacks Nuclear power phase-out Citigroup Security (finance) Estoppel Mortgage Social Security debate (United States) Municipal bond Hybrid vehicle Arbitrage Gold standard Finance Wal-Mart Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 British national identity card Internet fraud Financial services PE ratio Carburetor The Amazing Race Industrial Revolution Locomotive Cooperative Initial D Firefighter Enron Corporation Procrastination Taxation in the United States The Joker's Wild Energy Policy Act of 2005 Corporate finance Randomness George W.

does uk and australia use the same credit system as in the us credit as in credit card while there may be some similarities they are different systems different laws different credit reporting bureaus and rules for reporting i think one of the reason there seem to be so many discrepancies in replies here is that folks from different countries are responding of course some folks just are repeating bad information all three may have visa or mastercard but once again different laws and rules for different countries  Credit card Debit card MasterCard VISA (credit card) Octopus card Stored-value card Discover Card Smart card Pseudonymity Commonwealth Bank Credit card fraud H-1B visa Visa (document) Identity document Passport Chip and PIN Schengen treaty Slander and libel Auto insurance Indian nationality law Cricket EFTPOS Social Security (United States) Identity theft Mail-order bride Bank of America Cigarette Home Return Permit EMV Electronic money Scrip Loyalty program Rugby league British national identity card Credit repair Aldi Illegal immigration Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Bank Plame affair United Kingdom corporation tax Asian American Minimum wage Micropayment United States Department of State TransUnion Diners Club Immigration to the United States The Amazing Race Common Travel Area Law Right to silence Lee Harvey Oswald Bank fraud Toronto-Dominion Bank GSM services Legal tender Prostitution Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce United States Census Bureau John Lott REAL ID Act Credit history Hard disk Full Faith and Credit Clause Lawyer Khalid al-Mihdhar David Blunkett MV Tampa Financial statements Same-sex marriage Motion picture rating system Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Financial audit Utilitarianism Corporate governance E-ZPass Privacy Appeal Electrical engineering Jean Charles de Menezes Debate Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland British nationality law Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Tom DeLay Student loan Whose Line Is It Anyway?

so does anyone else understand this i'm going to be starting college in the fall my parents and i aren't in a good place right now because of some decisions that i made that they don't agree with i need a little bit more money for school but i've maxed out on most of the funds that are available to me i've tried to apply for a loan through many different places but has denied me because of my lack of credit history i can't find anyone that is willing to co sign either now i'm a good girl i don't smoke i don't drink i don't do drugs point being that i don't waste my money i'm responsible and i know how to budget the only reason that i haven't gotten a credit card is because i've always been taught that no credit is better than having bad credit how are you supposed to get anywhere in life when no one will throw you a bone all i need is about so that i can attend college buy a reliable vehicle and insurance i don't have a car to get to work so how am i supposed to keep a job help i mean i'm a smart girl top ten of my class i need to go to college but i just don't see how if i can't get my classes paid for or if i don't have reliable transportation to and from work and school well bull rooster aardvark how do you suggest that i get to school i live half an hour away that's my sacrifice not living on campus so i can save money not exactly a place where they have busses running either people my problem is getting to campus so thanks to everyone who suggested that i get a job on campus is an exorbinant amount of money to lend and is typically only loaned on secured collateral such as auto loans or mortgages your best bet is to obtain a student loan you are correct in stating that you will need a co signer however this will likely be referred to as a guarantor in some cases you may not need one and that is for smaller amounts just enough to get you through school not enough to buy a car also you need to complete your fafsa form this will allow the government to make a determination on your financial need based on your lack of income and on the income of your parents you'd be surprised you may qualify for grants which is free money that doesn't need to be repaid additionally you may be made aware of some scholarships you could potentially qualify for i was fortunate enough to receive a grant throughout college and never had to take any loans or pay out of pocket for my education i never expected that but then filling out the fafsa allowed the government to find those oppotunities for me if you're still interested in building your credit history you should begin by obtaining a low limit credit card my first card was through capital one who caters to college students also i would recommend american express blue these are all unsecured cards which means you will not have to pay a fee to open them or pay fees to maintain them as those with bad credit not no credit will have to do once you've established some time on this card and maybe another if you choose to open more than one you may want to look into obtaining a loan that would qualify as an installment account these are all debts that are contractual and not revolving meaning you are obligated to pay a certain note each month things like this are car loans lines of credit mortgages and personal loans having installment credit is one of the major things lenders consider when decisioning whether or not to grant you a loan some good first time buying companies to consider with your first auto loan are triad financial roadloans drive financial and americredit all cater to subprime clients and first time buyers i hope this information helps you  Education in the United States Debt Bank Life insurance Education in the People's Republic of China Capitalism Money

better credit score how would i go about getting my credit score up ten years ago i used consumers credit counseling to help pay off my credit card debit it was high i paid it off in years i still have ramifications from that period in my life even though i paid it off i didn't file bankrupty as a car dealer told mei would have been better off doing how long can this haunt me i have credit cards all with below limits and one car loan i am never late and if i use the credit card i pay it off when the bill arrives but still the past haunts me help the credit score as mysterious as a gypsy palm reading kind of yea sometimes i m surprised that some credit scores are better than it appears they should be and others are worse why i have no idea this system is not perfect and nobody knows exactly how it works strange but true i have a lot of information on this topic for you so i m going to split it up into two articles the first will address how credit scores are derived what affects them and the range of scores from good to bad the second article will cover steps to take to improve a poor credit score there are some key factors that are used in determining your basic score your payment histories recent late payments hurt a lot the older a late payment is the less impact on your score number of accounts that have balances if you have a dozen charge cards with balances consolidate them down to or there is no reason to have macy s nordstrom gap sears kohl s mervyns etc and owe to each of them use your visa card they all take it proportion of balances to credit limit this means don t max out your credit cards when your credit cards are at there limit it is a big red flag it s best to never use more than half of the available balance on a charge card length of time accounts have been opened old accounts with long payment histories are really great for a credit score this is the reason why you should not close charge accounts that you are not using just shred the card and stop using it this way the account remains active and continues to have a positive impact on your score credit inquiries an inquiry shows up when someone checks your credit report lot s of inquiries indicate you may be trying to open a lot of new credit which is a red flag if you get a new credit card every six months to get the low intro rate your credit score will suffer because of constant inquiries and the number of accounts which have been opened in the recent past collection accounts and public records if you owe a creditor and you re not paying they will send the account to a collection agency this shows up on your credit report bad when you get a bill from the doctor s office that your insurance did not cover do yourself a favor and pay it then you can try to get the insurance to reimburse you if they were wrong otherwise the doctor s office will waste no time going to collection medical collection accounts are so common it s ridiculous public records include judgments tax liens bankruptcy s etc all bad and should be avoided at all costs to keep your credit score in the positive range what is the positive range well credit scores run from worst to best generally speaking anything under is horrible from to is very bad and to is bad then from to is ok and to is good if you are over you have excellent credit and you ll get better rates on everything from credit cards to home loans and even insurance your credit score influences the cost of many important things in your life and should be taken very seriously next time we ll talk about how to keep your score high or to get it higher  Bank United Kingdom corporation tax Life insurance Health insurance Student loan Publicly funded medicine Mortgage Deflation (economics) Bond Credit history

how can one get items removed from the major credit agencies that are false entries i have written them wit i have supplied them with the documentation and they still will not remove it help if you have disputed the item and the credit bureau is still reporting it it is either because they did not recognize your letter as a dispute or because the creditor reported that the information was accurate when you disputed the item you should have received an acknowledgement of the dispute and then a resolution to your dispute if you did not receive these items then the credit bureau didn't recognize your letter as a dispute so start the dispute process over following the directions for a written dispute like address to write to etc given on the credit bureau's website send the letter 'return receipt requested' so you have proof that the credit bureau received the dispute if you did get an acknowledgement and a resolution what does the resolution say it probably says that the creditor confirmed that the information is correct in that case you will need to work with the creditor to remove the information as the credit bureaus will not remove information if the creditors say it is accurate good luck  Credit repair Plame affair United States Postal Service Cyprus dispute Probation officer The writing of Principia Mathematica Downing Street memo Social Security (United States) Bond Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act SCO-Linux controversies Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda RFID Financial audit Senate Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Surveillance Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Filioque clause Accounting methods Article One of the United States Constitution Identity theft UN Security Council Resolution 242 Corporate governance President of Ireland Babylonian law Joseph C.

if you consolidate all your debt of your credit cards does this terminate the credit cards i'm not in massive debt but i lost my job and i don't plan on using credit much so i just want it all paid so i don't have to worry about the balances but i don't want to lose my credit cards be wary of one thing some credit card issuers will actually decrease your credit limit or close the account for no activity although this usually only happens after long periods of inactivity with no balance i have seen cases of card holders having their credit limits decreased if they remain unused for over months with a balance if the card issuer closes the account it's not derogatory on your credit report meaning you will show a good clean history on the account which won't in itself drive down your credit scores but your scores will still go down because of having one less open trade line a good rule of thumb is to make sure you make at least one minor purchase every months and then pay the bill in full once you get your cards down to balance many people think that their credit card accounts can never be cancelled unless they request it as long as they have paid their bills on time and used the card resposibly this is not true however a card issuing bank has the right to cancel choose not to renew or decrease your credit limit based on any number of seemingly arbitrary reasons of which lack of activity too many other accounts or income doesn't justify credit line are just a few they're in business to make money and people holding no fee credit cards for years without making purchases on them don't provide any income for the issuing bank  Credit card Bond Security (finance) Debit card Mutual fund Gold standard Deflation (economics) United Kingdom corporation tax Legal tender FairTax Surveillance Money Short selling Personal finance Hyperinflation Mortgage Credit score Debt Student loan Octopus card Bank fraud Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Credit card fraud Internet fraud Financial services Double-entry book-keeping Poker jargon Betting (poker) EFTPOS Trademark Microeconomics HSBC Money supply Identity theft Ra (board game) Article One of the United States Constitution Economy of Russia Interest Annuity Bretton Woods system Monetary policy Capitalism Automatic teller machine Identity document Futures contract The Amazing Race Government debt H-1B visa Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Visa (document) Fiat money Citigroup Baccarat Great Depression Indian nationality law Gross domestic product MMORPG Euro Auto insurance Arbitrage Primerica Financial Services Driver's license Insurance Theodicy Certificate of deposit Government National Mortgage Association Capital accumulation Estoppel Inflation Fractional-reserve banking Law of value Mergers and acquisitions Loyalty program Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Life insurance Arthur Laffer Virgin Mobile SmartRider Financial audit Athenian democracy Tax Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Minimum wage Stored-value card Debt levels and flows History of the United States (1918-1945) Monopoly (game) Bank of America Copyleft Credit repair Corporation Blackjack Pai gow poker

i currently have a bank loan with payment protection supplied by hsbc the bank im with would there be any chance i could stop the insurance then get that money back and get independant payment protection which would be cheaper i doubt they would refund the premiums for credit insurance you have already used think about asking your health insurer to refund premiums becasue you were not sick unless you prepaid a significant portion of the insurance on a side note credit life and disability insurance is a complete ripoff you will probably never collect even if you have an incident warranted by your policy sep what types of insurance do you really need there is a lot of confusion these days over what types of insurance you really need there are only three but first let s discuss the kinds of insurance you don t need one kind of insurance you should never buy is credit life insurance also known as croak and choke mortgage life insurance is the technical term the salespeople pretend it s a great idea claiming that if you die your debts are paid off but how important is it to pay off your debts when you re gone basically with this insurance the bank gets paid off and gets your money instead of your heirs in addition the premiums are about times as high as traditional types of life insurance mortgage life s cousin is credit life insurance and you are pushed to get this when you buy a car or other big purchase these are sold as protection for you but really they provide protection for the bank so it s essentially like putting lipstick on a pig maybe it looks better but it s still a pig another popular item is the variable annuity it s almost never a good idea to buy one of these because there are monstrous commissions what about cancer insurance if you get cancer you need health insurance and term life insurance and that s it and if you can t work and need replacement of your income you want disability insurance those are the only three you need all the others you can chuck what about your car you don t need rental insurance when renting a car first of all if you get in an accident you ll owe regardless of whether you have insurance and usually your credit cards or auto insurance company has some type of temporary rental car coverage pec or personal effects coverage which covers things stolen out of your rental car is not necessary either  Auto insurance Health insurance Mortgage Annuity Bond Bank Citigroup Publicly funded medicine Personal finance Islamic banking Debt Credit card Predatory lending Money Primerica Financial Services Taxation in the United States Contract Great Depression Commodity markets Security (finance) Home insurance Interest Economy of the United States Financial services Unemployment benefit Variable universal life insurance Title insurance Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Tax Term life insurance Student loan Finance Wal-Mart Social Security (United States) Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Financial markets Monetary policy Deflation (economics) Derivative (finance) Internet fraud Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Octopus card Credit score HSBC FairTax Health maintenance organization Concurrent estate Monopoly (game) Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Capital accumulation Medicare (United States) Cooperative Government debt Lloyd's of London Universal life insurance Social security United Kingdom corporation tax Federal National Mortgage Association Economy of Russia Pension Adverse selection Leasing Inflation United States Postal Service Irish Life and Permanent Real estate broker Islamic economics Gold standard Money supply Payroll Gross domestic product Hyperinflation Savings and loan association Renting Confidence trick Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 US health reform under FDR Fractional-reserve banking Toronto-Dominion Bank Bank fraud Medicare (Canada) Poker jargon Sears Holdings Corporation Mortgage-backed security Popular, Inc Intellectual property Tesco Credit card fraud Neopets Real estate bubble

if creditor closes your account because you're making minimum payments is full payment immediately required this has never happened to me and i've always been on time with payments but currently only making minimum payments i've heard sometimes a creditor will close your account because of this if this happens does the creditor require payment in full immediately or will they continue to show you as making payments on time on your credit report what will the report look like if this happens thanks normally they will not close your acct for making min payments but if they do no payment is not do immediately they will continue to send you a bill until it is paid in full although it will not affect your credit unless you quit paying all together  Estoppel Bond Student loan Credit score Social Security (United States) Government debt Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Credit card Annuity Mortgage Debt Legal tender Deflation (economics) Fractional-reserve banking Bank Accounting methods Bretton Woods system United Kingdom corporation tax Hercules Linton Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Schabir Shaik Trial Cheque Islamic banking 401(k) Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Credit repair Life insurance Taxation in the United States Leasing Municipal bond Internet fraud Health insurance Concurrent estate Phishing Developing countries' debt Social Credit Corporation Article One of the United States Constitution Betting (poker) Universal life insurance Rick Santorum Timeline of the Enron scandal Letter of credit Financial audit Tom DeLay Bankruptcy Appeal Credit risk Economy of Russia Child support Money Tertiary education fees in Australia Debt levels and flows Octopus card Actuarial notation Credit derivative Copyleft Compensation of employees Gold standard Credit default swap U.S. generally accepted accounting principles Micropayment Primerica Financial Services Royal Assent Canadian federal election, 1965 Bank of Credit and Commerce International Corporate governance Minimum wage Accounts payable Government National Mortgage Association Salary Self-employment Economy of Argentina Accountancy Conrad Black Social Security debate (United States) Futures contract Certificate of deposit Toronto Computer Leasing Inquiry Joseph Smith, Jr. Corporate finance Tax credit Common Agricultural Policy Mail fraud Leasehold estate Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Argentine debt restructuring Double-entry book-keeping Baccarat Bill Bradley Derivative (finance) Personal finance Anarchism and capitalism Debt bondage Payroll Trade union Financial capital

interest rate question i suck at numbers which is one reason i am in debt over my head i am trying to make a budget to pay my bills off quicker than simply paying the minimum monthly payments how can i figure out what next month's total bill will be when i pay more than the minimum payment for example if the total balance with interest already added in is now and the interest rate is and the minimum payment is and i pay this month what will be the new total balance next month please tell me how to work this out so i can do it with all my bills and figure out how quickly i can get things paid off and paid down thanks in advance that's what i'm trying to figure out but i need to know how to calculate the interest rate each month after i make the payment so i can sit down and do a yearly budget plan this is a rough estimate but it should be close some credit cards calculate interest slightly differently and it can vary depending upon when you pay your bill assuming you make no purchases on the card balance balance annual rate months per year your payment new balance or for your first month ending balance the google spreadsheet linked below will let you play with different interest rates and payment amounts change any of the number to the right and the spreadsheet will autocalculate with new monthly balances interest payments etc keep in mind it's only an estimate your actual bill will vary a little bit because the credit card companies calculate interest to the day and may calculate it a little differently however it will be close right now lookin like a little over years unless you can increase your payment or negotiate a lower rate adam  Credit card Annuity Social Security (United States) Mortgage Interest Personal finance FairTax Microeconomics Economy of Russia United Kingdom corporation tax Student loan Food Stamp Program Bretton Woods system Insurance Credit score Mutual fund Unemployment Pension Life insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Explosive material U.S. public debt 401(k) Taxation in the United States Tax Octopus card Monetary policy Inflation Government debt Refinancing Corporate finance Keynesian economics Futures contract Deflation (economics) Auto insurance Salary cap Primerica Financial Services Social Security debate (United States) Economy of India National Insurance Bank Minimum wage Publicly funded medicine Municipal bond Financial audit Capitalism Capital accumulation Blackjack Dividend History of the United States (1918-1945) PE ratio Credit derivative Compensation of employees Actuarial notation Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Estoppel Ponzi scheme Finance Economic inequality Surplus value Arbitrage Unemployment benefit Debt consolidation Trade union Reaganomics Cost of capital Cheque Common Agricultural Policy Arthur Laffer Internet fraud Economy of Pakistan Treasury security Deficit spending Hyperinflation Health insurance Dog agility Oyster card Supply and demand Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Article One of the United States Constitution ELO rating system Gold standard Weimar Republic Redundant array of independent disks Mortgage-backed security Athenian democracy Collateralized debt obligation

building credit i am a year old student and i want to start building some credit history i was talking to a friend that is about the same age as me and in the same kinda situation as me and he said he applied to store credit cards examples being best buy circuit city old navy etc is this a good way to start building credit he said that since you can only use the credit card at that particular store you are less apt to go off on a spending craze and it makes it easier to keep track of is this true what kinda benefits and flaws does this method have for a young student like myself thanks for any and all help there are advantages of building credit with department stores but there are some disadvantages while you can only spend with that particular store it's only one piece of the credit building puzzle there's types of accounts that build credit revolving and installment credit cards and line of credit are revolving accounts while car notes furniture loans personal signature loans appliance loans boat and motorcycle and mortgages are all installment loans an example of a good mixture of credit accounts would be revolving major credit cards and one department store credit card and installment account if you have a student loan then you already have that covered since you're in college my suggestion would be to apply for a student card and use it for dire emergencies now let me define emergency just because you're broke that doesn't quite constitute an emergency a legit example would be that you need a book for a class asap and you don't have the cash to get it other than that it should be used once a month no more than month so that the activity can report on your credit an unused card doesn't do any good to build credit you don't want to overuse the card especially since you're in school a rule of thumb is that at any given time the balance should be at of your available credit for example if you have a limit then you should spend no more than but since you're in school it should be even less like this way you can build credit and by the time you graduate you can have credit established to help you make it out on your own a lot easier getting a department store card helps but it won't help you if you're in a jam so to recap getting a department store card can help build credit but not as much as a major credit card visa mastercard american express discover having different types of credit revolving and installment accounts is a good way to build credit proper use of credit cards is extremely light every month to show activity and only in dire emergencies student cards are easier to get approved for i hope that this answer helps good luck p s oh by the way i posted links to a few student credit card websites for you to check out  Credit card Student loan Bank Credit score Debit card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Amazing Race Poker jargon Octopus card Betting (poker) Citigroup RFID $ale of the Century Bank fraud Internet fraud Identity theft Consensus decision-making Money Life insurance Password Extreme Programming FairTax Smart card Sears Holdings Corporation Schabir Shaik Trial Digital rights management Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Computer Interest Driver's license United Kingdom corporation tax Personal finance Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Capitalism Annuity Money supply Craps Identity document Predatory lending Wheel of Fortune Copy protection Theory of conduct Social rule Neopets Deflation (economics) Gross domestic product Star Trek Customizable Card Game Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Primerica Financial Services Bank of China (Hong Kong) Marshall Plan MasterCard Debt consolidation Windows 2000 Great Depression Mortgage Bond Immigration to the United States MTR Best Buy Electronic money Microeconomics Cheating in Counter-Strike Slot machine Expert system Shit Auto insurance Cross site scripting College admissions Finance Automatic teller machine Insurance Redundant array of independent disks Graduate school Plurality electoral system Bulk vending Ra (board game) Department store Grade (education) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act President (game) Economy of the United States H-1B visa Bank of America Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Prolog Monetary policy Double-entry book-keeping MetroCard Monopoly (game) Light-emitting diode United States Postal Service Equine conformation

punishing credit card debtor what would be a good punishment for a credit card debtor who just does not care excluding those that cannot avoid it and those that are trying if it were up to you debtors prison maybe since they have no intention of paying the fact is that if they continue to do it i e file for bankruptcy every years then the judge sees the pattern or sees that maybe the person has credit cards and all are topped off then he may charge them with fraud then they do get jail time in addition a couple of years ago the law was changed and now at least until before the new orleans floods and other floods and fires in other parts of the country and people laden with medical bills people can apply for chapter but if the judge feels they should make payments and pay the creditor which the new law demands that they pay back most of what they owe then the judge will change their chapter to a chapter and have them hire an attorney to help them set up that payment plan  Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Bankruptcy Bankruptcy in the United States Debt Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Estoppel Tom DeLay Islamic banking Article One of the United States Constitution Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code United Kingdom corporation tax Appeal Babylonian law Credit score Child support Internet fraud Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code Taxation in the United States Bond Insurance Plame affair Credit card fraud Concurrent estate Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Deflation (economics) Divorce Bank Mortgage Money Merit Tort Power of appointment Tax Corporation Life imprisonment MCI Schabir Shaik Trial Government debt Auto insurance Lawyer Cheque Surveillance Kent Hovind 613 mitzvot Legal tender Timeline of the Enron scandal Donald Trump Northwest Airlines Privacy Usury Medical malpractice Legal fiction Fractional-reserve banking Unlawful combatant Bretton Woods system Social Security (United States) Minimum wage Marriage Enron Corporation Jack Abramoff Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 6 Jury Government of Maryland Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 9 Interest History of the United States (1918-1945) U.S. public debt Inflation Credit repair Debt bondage 2005 trial of Michael Jackson International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement United States v.

do green dot prepaid credit cards help build your credit my gut response is no it is not really a credit card a credit card is unsecured debt being pre paid green dot is more like a debit card here is a suggestion if you have savings go to a bank and ask if they offer secured credit cards example if you have in savings you could deposit the at the bank in a certificate of deposit the bank would give you a secured credit card with a maximum limit if you pay your bills on time everything is good if you fail to pay your bills the banks has your as collateral it secures the debt after a while with a history of paying your statement on time you can ask the bank if they can give you a unsecured credit card if they do this then you are on the road to building a credit history  Credit card Bond Bank Debt consolidation Security (finance) Electronic money Bank fraud Money E-ZPass Interest Mortgage Electronic toll collection Personal finance Legal tender Credit card fraud Internet fraud VISA (credit card) EFTPOS Money supply Collateralized debt obligation Economy of Russia Mortgage-backed security Monetary policy Student loan Fractional-reserve banking Mail Credit union Scrip Automatic teller machine Ulster Bank Surveillance Oyster card Money market Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Cheque IEEE 802.11 Identity theft Octopus card Smart card Social Credit Treasury security Government debt Bank of America Primerica Financial Services Deflation (economics) Identity document Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Double-entry book-keeping Certificate of deposit Hong Kong Monetary Authority Financial services Investment bank RFID BancNet Debt History of the United States (1918-1945) Donald Trump London Underground Bank of England Savings and loan association Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 HSBC Irish Life and Permanent Social Security (United States) Toronto-Dominion Bank Credit score Wachovia Citigroup Short selling MasterCard Economy of Chile H-1B visa Small business Global System for Mobile Communications Loyalty program Gold standard Securitization Great Depression Savings and Loan crisis Soci__t__ G__n__rale U.S. one hundred-dollar bill New Deal Phishing U.S. public debt Popular, Inc Liberty Dollar Article One of the United States Constitution Annuity U.S. fifty-dollar bill Fiat money Slot machine National Savings and Investments History of the United States (1789-1849) Unemployment benefit Capital accumulation Federal Reserve Electricity meter

what if i pay off the bad debt to build on another question i asked what would happen to my credit score if i paid in full my bad debts would that restart the years i currently have a credit score and need to increase it in less than two years i do have negative items which will be at the end of their seven year mark in three months you should check the collecting sol for your state to see were you stand since it has been almost years there could be a chance you are past the legal collecting sol and if so you would not be legally liable to pay to answer your question no an account cannot legally be re aged to report for a longer period than it normally would run it would not matter if you paid or not it cannot be re aged if you pay a negative account without requesting deletion your scores will drop since the account would be updated to reflect the recent payment status updating is not re aging even though they are negatives you will probably see a decrease in your scores when they drop off of your reports you would be losing history even though it is negative history your scores should rebound within months or so or probably even go higher as long as you keep the positive accounts in good standing if it were me and the accounts were due to drop off in months i'd send a dispute to the cra's claiming the accounts as obsolete and request removal i would not suggest doing that if a person is still within the collecting sol for their state and could not afford to pay the accounts off the first thing you should do is check your states collecting sol if you are still within sol send the collectors a debt validation letter do not sign your signature to any letter you send to a collector only print your initials or type your name everything you send to a collector should be sent certified mail return receipt when you get the signed cert green card back send your disputes to the cra's when the collector properly validates the debt send them a letter requesting to pay a portion of the amount as payment in full and that they will agree to remove what they had placed on your reports be absolutely sure you have it writing from them that they consider your payment as payment in full if you are past the collecting sol you do have a legal right to send the collector a sol letter which informs them that the debt is no longer legally collectible you might click on my profile and click on the last link i have listed you will be able to find the collecting sol for your state sample letter templates for validation sol etc never use a site that requires any payment for information especially when there are a few very good sites where you can get the same info and probably more for free  United States Postal Service FairTax Article One of the United States Constitution Bond Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Contract Annuity Life insurance Internet fraud Taxation in the United States Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Social Security (United States) Postage stamp Plame affair Advance fee fraud Deflation (economics) Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Microeconomics United Kingdom corporation tax Financial audit E-mail spam SAT Drug test Mail fraud Appeal Identity theft Tax protester Mortgage Unemployment Estoppel 2003 California recall Bank fraud Tax Euro Surveillance Debt Gmail Neopets Domain Name System Public-key cryptography Gold standard SCO-Linux controversies Credit repair Divorce Cross site scripting Pretty Good Privacy Child support Opportunity rover Socrates RuneScape Digital signature Make money fast Downing Street memo Money George W.

help i'm in in debt what should i do i'm in in credit card debt mostly from putting my college bills on there and spending carelessly what is the fastest way to pay it off should i take out a loan should i go to credit counseling or should i try to pay it off myself my current apr is i only have one job and i cant see myself getting another one because i start school soon and i can only have one job if a person has accumulated a large amount of credit card debt due to multiple credit cards the need for a proper counseling for credit card debt consolidation can't be understated credit card debt consolidation counseling helps a person get vital insights into the facts that can help him get control over the credit card debt credit card debt consolidation counselors are experts with a good knowledge of debt management budgeting and behavioral patterns of credit card holders these services are vital for those struggling to manage their credit card debts also called credit counseling or debt counseling the credit card debt consolidation counseling brings immediate relief to a credit card holder a person seeking credit counseling can get it from two types of organizations the professional or commercial organizations and the non profit organizations as depicted by its name or categorization the commercial organizations charge money for their credit counseling sessions and consolidation help on the other hand the non profit organizations offer free of charge services just because the non profit organizations are free it doesn't undermine their quality of service the persons associated with such organizations are thorough experts and have lived the trauma of being under credit card debt themselves and hence bring their vital experience to the credit card holder when a person approaches a credit counseling agency the first thing it will do is to take stock of the situation and get various facts about the credit card debt the credit counseling agency collects data about the income expenditure and spending habits it will guide the credit card holder about budgeting benefits and try to inculcate good financial habits read more from http www credit card gallery com article credit card debt consolidation and credit counseling great tools to get rid of credit card debt  Credit card United Kingdom corporation tax Economy of Russia Debt Personal finance Great Depression Security (finance) Insurance Bond Finance Government debt Gold standard Economy of India Deflation (economics) Student loan Microeconomics Annuity Capitalism Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 12 Social Security (United States) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Money Credit score Capital accumulation Gross domestic product Microcredit Mortgage Bretton Woods system Scientology beliefs and practices Inflation Asian financial crisis FairTax History of the United States (1918-1945) Citigroup Poker jargon Primerica Financial Services Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Social Credit Monetary policy Surveillance Debt consolidation Corporate finance Mergers and acquisitions Bank fraud Psychotherapy Reaganomics Gambling Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Psychoanalysis Hyperinflation Donald Trump Interest Prostitution Electronic commerce U.S. public debt Publicly funded medicine Unemployment Blackjack Credit repair Tax Live 8 Economy of Romania Schabir Shaik Trial Computer Hillary Rodham Clinton Taxation in the United States Economy of El Salvador Money supply Deficit spending Anarchism and capitalism Micropayment Economics Credit card fraud United States Postal Service Octopus card Temasek Holdings Windows XP Stock Federal Reserve Estoppel Keynesian economics Plame affair Surplus value Business performance management Economy of Nigeria Digital rights management Domestic violence Economy of Pakistan Slot machine

how many months it will take to build a good cridit i got one cridit card from bank of america this is my first cridit card now i'm trying to apply for a new cridit card from bank of america american express and different cards but they are unable to approve my request i'm so mad that they are not approve my request why they can not approve my request you are probably being turned down because you are attempting to open too many new revolving credit card accounts at one time besides the fact that each inquiry lowers your credit score having a lot of revolving accounts when you have a short credit history tends to lower your score instead of boosting it action plan keep this account balance under of the total limit if it is a line of credit make sure you never owe more than on it if you are trying to use the account to improve your score keep in mind payment history is the biggest factor in score if you pay the account in full before cycle date your credit report does not show any activity at all you are actually not getting a monthly payment reference it looks like the account is just sitting there for this reason you may want to make a small purchase and pay it back in equal installments and then repeat the process the interst that accrues should be nominal but the boost to your score will be much more significant no matter what always make at least the minimum payment on time before the due date make at least months of payments before any new inquiries when possible try to keep a diversified balance of debt try to open a personal loan before another credit card your goal should be to establish active tradelinesover the next months  Credit card Credit score Bank Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Monetary policy Bond Gold standard Bretton Woods system Personal finance Annuity Octopus card FairTax Economy of Russia Credit history Schabir Shaik Trial Debt Refinancing Interest Estoppel Betting (poker) Cheque Government debt Short selling Great Depression Keynesian economics Bank fraud Money supply Appeal Article One of the United States Constitution Supreme Court of the United States History of the United States (1918-1945) Baccarat Identity theft Money 401(k) Hyperinflation Life insurance Finance Capital accumulation Marshall Plan Microeconomics Mensal__o scandal Collateralized debt obligation Primerica Financial Services Credit card fraud Law of value United States Constitution Corporate finance Economy of Pakistan George W.

no credit history i just applied for a credit card but i got rejected first would i be rejected because i don't have a credit history i've never had a credit card or would i only be rejected if someone stole my identity and got me a bad credit rating at this point i'm going to college full time and i wanted the credit card just so that i can get a good credit rating i'm not making any income from a job but my mom does make some deposits to my checking account for things that i will need like money to buy college textbooks i was planning to use the credit card to buy textbooks and a few minor things at wal mart that i'll need and use my checking account funds to pay the credit card bill the only reason i want the credit card i repeat is to get a good credit rating did the lack of income from a job kill me if i don't have a credit history how do i go about getting it if i cannot have a credit card do i get a joint credit card with my mother or is that worthless only the bank knows why you were rejected it's more likely that you were rejected for not having a credit history or because you have no income good for you for getting a credit card young and wanting to build a good credit rating it will help you alot down the road a wise man once told me always apply for credit when you don't need it as banks will rarely give you credit when you do need it go figure if your mom is agreeable the easiest way to get a credit card is with her as a co signer i did the same thing as you when i turned my dad co signed but i never needed him to make a payment twelve years later i have the highest credit rating you can get i could have never done it without his signature down the road a good credit rating will help your get lons mortgages at a great rate if your mom is uneasy about co signing tell her you will get a low credit limit maybe if that still doesn't work check out your bank's website to see if they offer a visa debit card it's linked to your chequing account but allows you to do credit card type things like buy stuff online reserve hotel rooms etc one last piece of advice always pay the full balance by the due date if you do you will never pay a dime in interest and if you can handle having credit available some people can't they spend money without being able to afford it get a credit card that gets you airmiles or bonus points these usually have a higher interest rate but what do you care you're not paying interest remember if you pay your balance in full each month then these bonuses are exactly that bonuses we put everything on our credit card pay the balance in full each month then use the 'free' points to get free travel gas movie coupons whatever  Internet fraud Bond Money Debit card Bank fraud Mortgage Cheque Student loan Life insurance EFTPOS Octopus card Electronic money Debt FairTax Surveillance Ocean's Twelve Poker jargon Mutual fund Monetary policy Identity theft Credit score Money supply Wal-Mart Primerica Financial Services Citigroup Monopoly (game) Loyalty program Interest Microeconomics Deflation (economics) Schabir Shaik Trial Gold standard Public transport Credit card fraud Betting (poker) Economy of Russia Financial services Euro Blackjack Driver's license Great Depression Taxation in the United States Flat tax Certificate of deposit Legal tender Economy of the United States Derivative (finance) Craps Salary cap Minimum wage Keynesian economics Gross domestic product Marshall Plan British national identity card Mail fraud Annuity Bretton Woods system Theory of conduct Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 401(k) Inflation Identity document Satchel Paige Supply-side economics Insurance United Kingdom corporation tax America Online History of the United States (1918-1945) Capitalism Security (finance) Best Buy Star Trek Customizable Card Game James Hanratty National Kidney Foundation Singapore Social Credit Grand Theft Auto (game) Say's law Unemployment Publicly funded medicine Finance Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Economics Wheel of Fortune Education in the People's Republic of China Knots Landing Arthur Laffer Health insurance Education in Germany Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Donald Trump Federal National Mortgage Association

what happens when a creditor garnishes your wages what are the steps involved and will your payroll check be held up longer because of the garnishment first they have to go to court and obtain a judgment against you for a debt if garnishment is allowed in your state it is not allowed in all states or for all types of debts they then have to get a court order once that happens there is a period of time for appeals but once that is over your employer will receive the order to garnish your wages they turn it over to the payroll department and the specified amount is taken out from your pay check it does not delay you getting your check it just reduces the amount you get to take home that remains in effect until the specified date on the court order or if no ending date is given until your employer receives an order to stop the garnishment also the above answer is incorrect you can not be fired just because your wages are being garnished if you actually are fired because of this you would have a good case against the employeer for a violation of title iii of the consumer credit protection act  Credit card Payroll Social Security (United States) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Minimum wage FairTax Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Taxation in the United States Credit repair Tom DeLay Article One of the United States Constitution Deflation (economics) Inflation Cheque Tax Monetary policy Social Security debate (United States) Divorce Appeal Unemployment benefit Unlawful combatant Corporation Microeconomics Great Depression Supreme Court of the United States Australian constitutional law Bankruptcy in the United States Bond Betting (poker) Capitalism Mortgage Debt Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Economy of Russia Annuity Hyperinflation Magna Carta Food and Drug Administration Economy of the United States Salary cap Unemployment United Kingdom corporation tax Same-sex marriage in Canada Government of Maryland Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Plame affair Insurance American individualist anarchism Arbitration Bank fraud Trust (Law) USA Financial audit Social Credit USA PATRIOT Act Life insurance Contract Human resource management system Labour economics Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Legal tender Government of India Bush v.

credit scores whats the best way to raise my credit score and also how does it work does it matter if i paid off my vehicle and paid off my credit cards need some answers here's how your score is broken down payment history total debt owed vs available credit length of time establishing credit types of credit established inquiries and new accounts paying on time and keeping your credit card debt in check are the two best ways to raise your score some more ways to increase your score would be to request line increases on your credit cards it's good practice to keep the balances at no more than of your available credit on all your cards it helps to have balance between revolving credit cards line of credit and installment car furniture appliance personal signature student loans mortgages accounts revolving major and dept store and installment accounts are an example of balance between accounts another tip is to not apply for any additional credit that's not necessary also start using old accounts that you haven't used in a while and don't close any which could lower your score as well while it helped that you paid off your car to lower the total debt that you owe once again it's important to continue to use all of your cards lightly pay on time and request line increases regualrly an easy way to build credit with an installment account would be to take out a personal loan using a certificate of deposit cd as collateral then open up another cd with the proceeds from the loan this way you not only gain interest from both cd's but you insure that you're able to repay the loan if necessary hopefully these tips will give you a better understanding good luck  Credit card Mortgage Credit score Bond Bank Student loan Debt Security (finance) Government debt Personal finance Annuity Great Depression Internet fraud Economy of the United States Interest Economy of Russia Taxation in the United States Finance Schabir Shaik Trial Insurance Identity theft Islamic banking Microcredit Bank fraud Collateralized debt obligation Deflation (economics) Surveillance Credit history Life insurance Savings and loan association Monetary policy Primerica Financial Services Tax Citigroup History of the United States (1918-1945) Unemployment benefit Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Short selling Stock Refinancing Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Marshall Plan Microeconomics Credit union Mortgage-backed security Derivative (finance) Collateralized mortgage obligation 401(k) Economy of the Philippines Octopus card Bretton Woods system Neopets Auto insurance Mutual fund Certificate of deposit Estoppel Debit card Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 U.S. public debt United Kingdom corporation tax Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Islamic economics Unemployment Cheque Financial services Social Credit Password Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Contract Donald Trump Betting (poker) Corporation Electronic toll collection Federal National Mortgage Association Small business Craps Economy of Chile Economy of Pakistan Fiat money Tertiary education fees in Australia E-mail spam Financial markets Economy of India Toronto-Dominion Bank Double-entry book-keeping Bankruptcy in the United States Driver's license Commodity markets Capital accumulation Education in the People's Republic of China Value added tax

does lowering your credit limit lower your credit score i already have several credit cards i want to lower the limit on one which i have used for several years from to maybe or also i want to cancel a credit card limit which i have never used will doing either of these things lower my credit score i am planning on doing this because i want to get a different credit card for home improvements lower interest and i want to make sure that i wont be denied because i have to much credit for how much i make obviously if my credit score goes down that wont bode well for this endeavor either thanks in advance and please only answer if you know what you are talking about i only have about on the credit card i also have a credit card but i can't cancel that one even though i haven't used it because it is a dental credit card my total available limit right now is around i certainly wont use it all but we are fixing up our kitchen and want to get a specific credit card with no interest for a year i don't make much money but i wont be the only one paying this off i just have the highest credit score i believe its lowering your credit limit and or closing a card will have a negative impact on your scores the thinner your credit file the more it will hurt since it sounds like you only have cards that would be considered a very thin file plus when a credit limit is lowered the other creditors will notice there could be a strong possibilty that the other creditors will follow suit and lower the credit limits on those cards also i know many people who have credit limits that exceed their annual income by or times and some have more in general they are not penalized by having that much credit since they take care of their accounts you didn't mention if the card you are thinking about is a store card or a major card if you are planning on getting a store card from home depot or lowes go in person to apply i'm not sure about lowes and unlike many creditors i know hd does have a say in the approvals when someone applys in store if hd is aware that you will be spending money in their store that may sway them to make sure you are approved  Credit card Estoppel Student loan Credit score Sears Holdings Corporation Insurance Taxation in the United States Hearts (game) Corporation Tom DeLay Wal-Mart 401(k) Deflation (economics) United Kingdom corporation tax Economy of Russia Surveillance Flat tax Poker jargon Stud poker Mortgage Mutual fund Keynesian economics Bond Public transport Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Inflation Windows Vista Interest Debt Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Legal tender Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ELO rating system Annuity Contract bridge Octopus card Microeconomics Personal finance Trademark Life insurance Year 2000 problem Mao (game) Motion picture rating system Social Security (United States) Digital photography Publicly funded medicine Social rule Hard disk Article One of the United States Constitution Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Fixed-wing aircraft Ocean's Twelve Identity theft Betting (poker) Plame affair Canasta Blackjack British national identity card Social Credit Playing card History of Microsoft Windows Password Copyleft RFID Jeopardy!

i have really bad credit can i ever fix it i'm in college and made stupid decisions with my first creit card all of my debt is paid off but i paid it late to a collection agency i've also bounced checks in the past and overdrawn my account so my credit score is pretty horrible now i can't get approved for any cards so i can't improve my score i'm totally ashamed of how careless i've been eileen it's not the end of the world let start off by saying that people make mistakes that's why there's rubber at the end of pencils the first step which you've done is acknowledging your past mistakes and preparing to correct them first things first in order to raise your score it helps to know what makes up your score payment history total debt to avaialble credit length of time establishing credit types of credit established inquiries and new accounts ok now that's out the way now you have to equip yourself with some tools to get you back on the right track starting with a checking account now you mentioned that you bounced checks in the past and overdrew your account the only way that this would hurt your score is that the account closed while it was still overdrawn hopefully that didn't happen and you still have a checking account a checking account is one of the most important and powerful tools when it comes to building credit it does many things like establish a banking relationship to where you can make yourself available to other products that are offered just by being a customer but more importantly it allows you to do the most important thing in building credit paying your bills on time now if you don't have a checking account then that can be a problem especially if you're in chexsystems for bouncing checks and overdrafts an option you can do is accountnow accountnow is perfect for people that has had problems in the past with checking accounts and now can't get one it has a debt card and online billpay that also helps to build credit http www accountnow net default aspx pcode ct skl like one of the posters had mentioned getting a secured credit card would be the best way to go right now you would have to put a deposit upfront that's used for collateralto get a credit line of the same amount for example if you put up you would get a credit line now the credit can be increased by adding to the deposit which wouldbe a good idea because the higher the limit that reports on your credit the better another thing is that the deposit gains interest while you're building credit so the bigger the deposit the more interest you gain a suggestion on how to use the card would be to make small purchases that can be paid off on time every month month it's important to manage the balance so that it doesn't get out of hand and get maxed out at any given time you should use no more than of your available credit for example you have a limit of your balance should be no more than after paying on time and managing the available credit for usually a year or so the card either changes to a regular one or a better card's offered and the deposit is given back i posted some links to some secured credit card companies i would suggest opening with different companies and no more major cards after that for a while hopefully these tips i've provided will help you out some good luck  Bank Credit score Internet fraud Student loan Mutual fund Bond Mortgage Bank fraud Betting (poker) Monetary policy Debit card Poker jargon Octopus card Phishing Surveillance Money FairTax Credit history Microeconomics Financial audit Corporate finance Citigroup Cheque Money supply Windows XP Gold standard Security (finance) United States Postal Service Table tennis Bretton Woods system Deflation (economics) Blackjack Social Security debate (United States) Finance Capital accumulation Economy of the United States Personal finance United Kingdom corporation tax Certificate of deposit Ashton-Tate Identity theft Life insurance Plame affair Government debt Article One of the United States Constitution Gross domestic product Schabir Shaik Trial Mergers and acquisitions Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Alcoholics Anonymous Islamic banking Baccarat The Amazing Race Customer relationship management Economy of Brazil Tom DeLay Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Bank of China (Hong Kong) Japan-United States relations Insurance LiveJournal History of the United States (1918-1945) Star Trek Customizable Card Game Electronic money Keynesian economics XML Capitalism Topps Supply and demand Gmail New York Giants Marshall Plan Social Security (United States) Debugging Law of value Investment bank Economy of Pakistan Arthur Laffer Collision detection RuneScape Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Game programming Great Depression Sears Holdings Corporation Textile manufacturing Contract bridge

about credit cards and using not using them them i started out with a student visa card too easy to get maxed it out when i needed it and paid it back over a period of a few months the credit card company made money that's for sure since i took a year off school the company changed my plan and it's due to expire i haven't used it in a long time i like the security and convienence of having a credit card for those just incase situations but i live and work overseas making it not so easy and don't claim an income should i go to the trouble of using my card in order to continue being able to have the card when i move back or do credit card companies usually just renew cards even if you don't use it more than once or twice a year and have like no claimable income i know they want me to have that option of maxing it out cause that makes them money assuming that you can pay the card online which makes payment much easier oversees i'd use it a couple of times and make sure that you pay it off at the end of the month so you don't have interest charges as long as it doesn't have an annual fee keeping a credit card open and in good standing will help you in the long run just make sure the credit card company knows your current address if they try to send you a replacement card and they can't deliver it to you then they will cancel the account if you have them send it to your parent's place make sure they call to activate the new card if the credit company sends you a new card and you don't activate it they will eventually cancel the account i've had both of those happen to me with accounts i moved and didn't tell the credit card company and they canceld my card and i got a card that i didn't activate and they canceled my account i hope this helps  Credit card Student loan United Kingdom corporation tax Life insurance Octopus card EFTPOS Debit card Credit card fraud Virgin Mobile Surveillance Insurance Short selling Bond H-1B visa Annuity Visa (document) Personal finance United States Postal Service Driver's license Advance fee fraud America Online Bank The Amazing Race Gross domestic product Scrip Citigroup Social Security (United States) Taxation in the United States Credit score Data retention Mail Topps Identity theft Craps Poker jargon Phishing Donald Trump Television licence Bank fraud Smart card Interest Betting (poker) MasterCard Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Blackjack Debt Public-key cryptography Auto insurance Mail fraud Freeters National Insurance Immigration to the United States American Express Playoff Money Cheating in poker Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Economy of Russia Wal-Mart Electronic money Flat tax FairTax 401(k) Gold standard Baccarat Mortgage Child support Cheque MetroCard GSM services Corporation Euro George W.

can someone help me with most common objections in telesales i want to know questions and answers of the most common sales objections you can come across for example i hav to speak to my partner first how do handle that i'm going to use the universal widgets example when discussing business if unfamiliar widgets are a fictitious product that you are trying to sell to begin the most important thing to remember in telephone sales is that it is a numbers game even if you never knew how to overcome an objection and you simply just asked people if they would like to buy midgets some people would still say yes on the flip side no matter how good you are at selling widgets some people will always say no so just make lots of calls and you'll make lots of widget sales i have to speak to my partner first a the client is not convinced that what you are offering is worth the buy needs more information but would prefer to just politely end the call with a sorry excuse b mr client this is a pretty big decision so i understand you need to discuss this with your spouse just out of curiosity what do you think they'll like or dislike about my widgets then you can have a discussion with them about what their spouse likes or dislikes it keeps them on the phone and gives you more opportunity to sell i'm happy with the widgets that i have right now a you haven't stimulated your customer enough to want to listen or pay attention b fantastic i'm glad that you are a loyal client of widget central before i get off the phone with you what would be the one thing you could change about your current widget you'll either get a nice response that will allow you to continue your conversation or you'll get nothing continue with open ended questions that begin with why or what until one of them opens them up to talk to you the worst that will happen is they hang up and you move on i'm not interested right now but i'd like to get your number in case i'm interested later a they aren't interested at all but you're a nice guy and they'd like you to think they care b i appreciate the consideration what's the main reason you'd be motivated to buy in the future vs today you could go on for hours here but main things to do in sales on the telephone are simple make the calls and ask for the sale take rejections before moving on ask open ended questions to gather information ask for the sales it generally takes phone calls to get sales in most industries  Microeconomics Theory of conduct Extreme Programming Social rule Plame affair Supply and demand Internet fraud Time Out of Mind Telephone exchange Humphrey Bogart Consensus decision-making Capital accumulation Password Value added tax Customer relationship management Ashton-Tate John Kerr Ethics Contract Annuity Shaggy dog story Monetary policy Xlib English grammar Java programming language Intellectual property Goodness and value theory Little Britain MMORPG Stardock Current teachings of Prem Rawat X Window System Konfabulator Wal-Mart Voice over IP Infantilism Whois $ale of the Century UK telephone numbering plan Asperger syndrome Surplus value New Coke Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Rich Mullins Phone sex Same-sex marriage in Canada Polyamory Law of value Wheel of Fortune Sexual orientation Philosophy of business Philosophical skepticism Call centre Big Brother (USA TV series) Milton H.

auto repossession question my friend let's call him ben had gotten a title loan couple of years back on his toyota he made several payment but could not keep up with the payments the loan company sent out repo people several times to his house but it was at times when he wasn't there about a month after the repo guys started dropping by ben had to move to new place because his lease has expired ben of course did not inform title loan company it has been little over years since that time and ben still has the car however he has not been able to register it because the title loan company has their names on the title as co owners and they would need to sign off on the form as well now he recently moved from ca to another state job related here is what ben would like to know what would happen if he surrended the vehicle now did ben need to tell the loan company where the vehicle was when he realized the repo guys were coming around since it's been over years is there any legal remifications he needs to worry about is there any way that he can register the vehicle without the loan title company signing off on it what happens if repo never finds ben and ben never lets them know where he is he has never intentionally avoided them but he neither let them know where he was either nothing regarding this vehicle amount owed or the repo has appeared on his credit report do the repo guys have to physically repo the vehicle before anything appears on this credit report any help is appreciated if he returns it they would sell the vehicle for far less than what he owes on it he would be liable for the deficiency any repo fees any interest that has accrued in the past years even if he takes it to them in person there would still be repo fees the cost of of the previous repo attempts the paperwork the cost of conditioning the car for resale at auction the cost of transporting it to the auction site etc etc etc it's doubtful ben would face any legl ramifications the loan company and repo people have many ways of tracing people it sounds like they just dropped the ball on completing the repo if he had received a court order demanding the car be turned over and ignored it then he probably does have legal ramifications no he will not be able to register it without the loan company signing off there could be many different things that may happen they could continue to forget about it they could easily find where he lives and continue to try to repo it they could get a court order demanding he turn it over he is fortunate that it is not reporting he should check with the courts in every town county he has lived in since he defaulted to see if there is a judgment filed against him it would be in his best interests if he managed to get a loan with a different loan company to cover the cost of the vehicle and pay the existing loan company off if he did that he would be able to title the car and quit having to look over his shoulder i seriously doubt the existing loan compny will ever even consider dealing with him in taking payments on the car until he takes care of the loan he will never legally be able to sell trade the car it is not his to sell if he sells it he could be charged with a felony  Insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Credit card Bond Life insurance Mortgage Student loan Corporation Islamic banking Ford Motor Company Short selling Annuity SCO-Linux controversies Leasing Health insurance Auto insurance Copyright London Congestion Charge Internet fraud Security (finance) Taxation in the United States Citigroup Gold standard Derivative (finance) Intellectual property Steve Jobs Public domain Trademark Bank Predatory lending Appeal Bank fraud Interest Economy of Russia Mutual fund Estoppel Infantilism Unemployment Arbitrage Neopets Contract CPU cache Concurrent estate 401(k) Great Depression Advance fee fraud Toyota Prius Debt Stock New England Patriots Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act American Motors Money Article One of the United States Constitution Knots Landing Economy of the United States Oakland Athletics Hybrid vehicle Credit score Islamic economics First-sale doctrine Deflation (economics) Primerica Financial Services The Amazing Race Vehicle registration plate Plame affair Capitalism Battery electric vehicle Allodial title George W.

how do i build my credit score how do i build my credit score and make it really strong well i definitely agree with a lot of the first poster said but to really know how to build your score it helps to have an idea on what makes up your score so i'll break that down for you payment history total debt vs available credit length of time establishing credit types of accounts established inquiries and new accounts now having said that as you can see that payment history and total debt vs available credit are the most important factors one missed payment can end up costing you that's why it's important to pay on time you can do this by equipping yourself with the most powerful tool to build credit a checking account by establishing a banking relationship by opening up a checking and savings account you not only make yourself more available to other products the bank offers but you provide yourself a means of paying on time which is the single most important part of building credit the majority of banks offer online billpay that help deliver your payments quickly another benefit by opening up a checking account is that by being an accountholder it makes it easy to get a secured credit card if the bank offers them you can think of a secured credit card as building credit with a savings account because that's basically how they work a deposit is placed upfront usually tied to a savings account used as collateral for a credit line the same amount of the deposit for example if the deposit is then the credit line would be the deposit isn't used to pay the minimum payment or amount owed unless the account becomes delinquent to where it has to be used major benefits of secured cards are that the credit line can be increased by adding to the deposit and the deposit also gains interest while credit is being established depending on the credit card company usually after months of paying on time and keeping the balance low by making small purchases the card either changes to a regular card or a better card's offered altogether and best of all the deposit is no longer needed and given back with interest included it also helps your credit score if you're able to increase the credit line as high as possible since having high limits and low balances really help your score another way to build credit with your bank account is by taking out a small loan like by using a savings account or a certificate of deposit cd as collateral then take the proceeds of the loan and open another certificate of deposit long enough where it's slightly shorter than the length of the loan itself this way not only you're still gaining interest on the collateral but on what you borrowed too you also insure that the money to repay the loan is readily available if necessary after paying the loan's paid off repeat the process several months later to establish different types of credit an example of a balanced mixture of credit would be revolving credit cards and installment accounts by opening secured credit cards one department store card and the loan would be a good start to building credit lastly enroll with prbc prbc is america's alternative credit bureau providing a helpful service to the over million people with limited or no credit history if you pay your monthly bills on time prbc can help you build credit to qualify for a mortgage and better interest rates i posted links to some secured credit cards websites as well as prbc below i hope this answer helps good luck  Security (finance) Life insurance Insurance Monetary policy Bank fraud

is my bank making this up or is this true i went in today to sign up for a checking account the main point of this was to get a debit card so i can buy stuff online without having my parent's credit card and also to bring around so i don't have to carry lots of cash i have a job so i'd just deposit my checks into there well i go in and they say i can't get one since i'm only and you have to be which i think is a load of crap because lots of my friends have their own cards in their name my mom is even on the account with me but they still won't let me get one but my mom was able to get one they said we could both us it but how if the card is in her name how can i use it i can see how to use it for atms and online because all i need is a pin but how would i use it in the store if it's in her name them how can i use it in the store the bank is right to have any single bank account you must be or over if you are younger than you can get a joint account with someone or older a joint account works quite easily you both will have access to the account in your case you each should receive a debit card with your name on it or you both may get one with both your names on it as long as you have a photo id you won't have any problems  Debit card Automatic teller machine EFTPOS Bank fraud Credit card Internet fraud Octopus card Password MetroCard Electronic money Surveillance Cheque Credit card fraud Identity theft Two-factor authentication SmartRider Money Craps E-ZPass Oyster card Double-entry book-keeping Loyalty program Money supply London Underground Personal finance Ulster Bank Stored-value card Bank of America Neopets MapleStory Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Interac Bank of China (Hong Kong) Citigroup Automated Clearing House Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Popular, Inc Schabir Shaik Trial Online gambling Small business Blackjack The Amazing Race Slot machine Steam (content delivery) Online shop Electronic commerce RFID Betting (poker) Scrip Asset Discover Card Financial audit Filling station Authentication Magnet Euro Finance VISA (credit card) Shit Credit union Cruising (maritime) E-mail MTR Best Buy Sears Holdings Corporation Windows XP CPU cache Phishing Tesco Draw poker Identity document Financial services President's Choice Financial Wheel of Fortune Frank Abagnale Mutual fund ITunes Music Store Wall Street TransUnion Gold standard Margin (finance) Charles Ponzi Star Trek Customizable Card Game Playing card Poker jargon Economy of Chile Commodore 64 Monetary policy David Beckham AmigaOS Digital photography Rail terminology BancNet Liberty Dollar Transaction processing Enron Corporation

i got denied credit because of too many public records what is that is that having too many credit accounts open and what not because i have and i thought that was fine so the limit to balance ratio could potentially be higher therefore increasing my credit score am i wrong i was told that or does that mean something else anyways this is annoying becuase it's near impossible to know what's right and what's wrong everyone tells you a different thing can you believe it's wrong to go over of your total allowed limit that is insane if you're allowed you should be able to spend up to that amount i really don't see why they'd penalize you for spending more than a certian percentage baloney this whole credit thing is a compilcated stupid game that's all it is and it's ridiculous absolutely ridiculous sorry to see youre having trouble getting the credit cards you want i hope this helps you your credit score is an important factor when determing your creditworthiness which in effect determine what kind of credit you are eligible for you're not wrong to have a lot of credit open but say if you have only a little bit of available credit on each account then that's going to hurt your score public records effect your score because they are usually things like tax liens your past due taxes that are bought from the government at a lower rate by private collection companies to force you to pay civil court hearings child support and other reported losses that make you a credit risk to banks that would otherwise offer you credit so as you can see your credit score is very important the credit score is a system used by banks to determine how likely you are to pay them back in the event that they were to offer you credit every negative thing in your report hurts your creditworthiness in the eyes of lenders and it is now an industry standard so it is important to follow it if you want credit in the u s when you're trying to build a solid credit score it's important to get a comprehensive view of what is actually effecting it your credit score also known as your myfico score is calculated with the following breakdown payment history credit to debt ratio credit history new credit credit types in use i raised my score to well over points fro using these steps in less than a year know and track your credit score be sure to sign up for the free trial of your credit score tracking listed below it really helped my get my score up never miss a payment starting today never use more than of your available credit keep credit cards that have no annual fees open for as long as possible extend your credit limit on cards you already have before you get new ones get credit cards that have cashback rewards to contribute to your balance transfer your balance to a credit card with a lower interest rate and a higher available credit if you think you are going to be forced to pay a bill late ask for an extension or payment plan take out a small personal loan and repay it over a year ask someone with good credit if they will account shadow you read more here from my millionster com ways to boost your myfico score http millionster com articles debt increase fico credit score  Bank Insurance Deflation (economics) Bond Government debt FairTax Taxation in the United States Mutual fund Tax Microeconomics Inflation United Kingdom corporation tax Bretton Woods system Social Security (United States) Gross domestic product Capitalism Credit history Finance Money Economy of India Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Keynesian economics History of the United States (1918-1945) Capital accumulation Social Security debate (United States) Economy of the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 401(k) Yield curve Mergers and acquisitions Short selling Great Depression Derivative (finance) Minimum wage Money supply Personal finance U.S. public debt Predatory lending Corporation Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Pension Publicly funded medicine Estoppel Credit derivative Tariff Child support Poker jargon Surveillance Hyperinflation Financial services Arbitrage Schabir Shaik Trial Bank fraud Citigroup Education in the United States Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Donald Trump PE ratio National Insurance Microcredit Salary cap Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Free trade Balanced Budget Amendment Security (finance) Article One of the United States Constitution London Congestion Charge Primerica Financial Services Economy of Chile Octopus card Futures contract Risk management Federal National Mortgage Association Supply-side economics Economy of El Salvador Credit card fraud

i turned my mom in for fraud now i'm nervous what do i do maybe a year ago she order some credit cards in my name signed my signature maxed them out and wouldn't paid them back she ruined my credit so last night i sent the companies an email letting them know that i didn't do it and i wanted them investigated on who opened those accounts and i knew she did it their investigating it right now and it hit me that's a major crime and she did it but that's my mom and i love her i don't want her in jail can i get them to stop the investigation if not will they seriously put her in jail i hope so what kind of deadbeat steals from her own daughter and ruins her credit this will take you years to clear up quite honestly anyone who does this is a horrible person but it takes an especially awful one to do it to a loved one you should not feel bad she is an adult and did this to her own daughter please do not feel guilty you are the victim it is not your responsibility to clean up your mom's mess seriously it will take you years to clear this up and your credit will probably be messed up for a long long time you will be paying higher interest rates possibly getting turned down for jobs etc that being said it is very unlikely that she will go to jail even if they bother to book her which is extremely unlikely she will be out as soon as she is booked and stands before a judge to declare her guilt or innocence just so you know you need to file a police report if you expect this to be cleared up the companies are not going to release these debts on your word and they don't have investigators that do any leg work dave ramsey has very very harsh words for folks that would do this to a family member i tried not to use them above good luck  Knots Landing Plame affair Internet fraud Theory of conduct Credit card Advance fee fraud 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Schabir Shaik Trial One Tree Hill (TV series) Leo Frank The Inside Charmed 2000 Australian Grand Prix 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Punisher Henry Lee Lucas Pitaten Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story Capital punishment Ocean's Twelve Cindy Sheehan Neighbours Ashton-Tate Miscarriage of justice Sin City Sharon Tate Karl Rove Plame affair timeline Charles Ponzi Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Poker jargon Days of our Lives Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Kurt Cobain Jonathan Wild Anti-Defamation League Collateral (film) Futurama (TV series - season 2) The Adventures of Pete & Pete Martha Stewart Wyatt Earp Jack Thompson James Hanratty Murder Phishing Tenshinhan Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) British national identity card Schapelle Corby Enron Corporation Bond Will & Grace Major League Baseball television contracts Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Trailer Park Boys Blonde on Blonde Volkert van der Graaf E-mail spam Saruman Dial M for Murder Yoko Ono Charles Manson Highway 61 Revisited Law & Order Phoebe Halliwell Delta Goodrem History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Presumption of innocence Timeline of the Enron scandal Futurama (TV series - season 5) Socrates The Death Gate Cycle Ethel and Julius Rosenberg Jon Secada Fraud Infantilism Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Eddie Guerrero Rent (musical) Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Blood on the Tracks Columbine High School massacre Fair Game (Scientology) Timeline of hacker history Rape Hip hop rivalries Sabra and Shatila massacre Diana Ross

is it better or worse to apply for a car loan with a co signer i am about to apply for a car loan via the internet and even though my credit is not so good my cash is so anyhow i was wondering if applying with a cosigner has a more positive affect than negative in other words will it ruin my chances of obtaining the loan or make them a little better now to actually answer your question auto finance is what i do for a living and using a co signer makes sense in three cases first if your credit is bad you need a good co signer to get approved for the loan second would be if your income is not enough to qualify for the payment third would be if you had a open auto loan on your report that you were not trading in and needed the co signer to qualify for another open auto either way you both get the exact same credit for the loan when someone looks at your credit in the future all they will see is either a j for joint or a c for co sign no one will know who is the primary and who is the secondary signer if the loan is paid as agreed you both gain from it if it's not you both lose from it  Bond Student loan Kyoto Protocol Monetary policy Credit score Life insurance Derivative (finance) United Kingdom corporation tax Money Predatory lending Debt Great Depression Insurance Interest Deflation (economics) Taxation in the United States Mortgage Microeconomics Internet fraud Marshall Plan Auto insurance Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Contract Schabir Shaik Trial Short selling Personal finance Islamic banking Credit card Notary public Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Real estate broker 401(k) Corporation FairTax Futures contract Government debt Article One of the United States Constitution Bank fraud Estoppel Collateralized debt obligation Trademark Economy of the Philippines Capitalism Corporate finance Productive and unproductive labour Security (finance) Annuity Citigroup Social Credit Economy of Russia Tariff Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Tertiary education fees in Australia Stock Inflation Financial markets Israeli settlement Education in the United States Commodity markets Education in the People's Republic of China Gold standard Credit union Mortgage-backed security Bank 2000 Australian Grand Prix Hyperinflation Audi Tax Henry Ford Municipal bond Plame affair Copyright Finance Babe Ruth Unemployment benefit Payday loan Donald Trump Bretton Woods system Blackjack Arbitrage Mensal__o scandal Fractional-reserve banking Islamic economics Economy of Africa National Certificate of Educational Achievement History of post-Soviet Russia Privatization Credit derivative Margin (finance) Abortion debate Feudalism Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004 Money supply Autograph Ra (board game) Microcredit Social Security (United States) Economy of El Salvador

can you file bankruptcy against credit card companys if you used the cards months ago if you lost your job as long as there is no intent of fraud when you used them you should be fine however if you just lost your job and this is the only reason you are filing bankruptcy you should wait and see if your situation improves it is going to cost you at least dollars to file and with the current bankruptcy laws you may not even qualify for a chapter so even if you have a couple of bills that go to collections if you can get them taken care in a few months that will look a lot better than filing a bankruptcy  Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Bankruptcy Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Credit card Medical malpractice Enron Corporation Tort reform MCI Asbestos Bankruptcy in the United States Fraud Social Security (United States) Wal-Mart Timeline of the Enron scandal Advance fee fraud United Kingdom corporation tax Deflation (economics) Health care in the United States Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code Credit repair Bond Northwest Airlines Mail fraud British national identity card Bulk vending Sears Holdings Corporation Tom DeLay Credit score Credit card fraud Delta Air Lines Plame affair Food Stamp Program Identity document Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Dave Reichert United Airlines 3dfx Wang Laboratories Computer Dot-com Mac OS X Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Redundant array of independent disks PE ratio Internet fraud Medicare (Canada) Online poker Appeal 1995 Quebec referendum Poker jargon Statute of limitations Mesaba Airlines Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 6 ITunes Music Store Asbestos and the law Publicly funded medicine Confidence trick Article One of the United States Constitution 2003 California recall Octopus card Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004 Credit history Moore's law Drug test Interplay Entertainment Debt Secretar__a de Inteligencia The Amazing Race Revco MAME S3 Graphics Centrelink Divorce Surveillance GSM services Apple Macintosh Health insurance Martha Stewart Florida Central Voter File Digital rights management Legal tender Continental Airlines 2004-05 in English football Minimum wage Smart card Donald Trump Jack Abramoff Pittsburgh Steelers Skype IMac Bank Terri Schiavo FairTax Mike Tyson Lionel Corporation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Cybercrime

i have two student loans that are in default on my credit report if i start paying them will score go up i know that if you have collection accounts on your credit usually paying them really doesn't help your score because even though paid the collection stays on your account for seven years but does this apply for defaulted school loans second answer no your score will not go up as you were late and that cannot be changed however paying the debt could prevent your score from going even lower paying the debt now rather than waiting eliminates the debt from your record late payment generally affects your score for two years while a complete default on the loan can remain significantly longer  Student loan Credit score Credit card Mortgage Government debt Debt Credit default swap United Kingdom corporation tax Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Money 401(k) Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Annuity Deflation (economics) Debt consolidation Graduate school Interest Islamic banking Economy of Russia Monetary policy Derivative (finance) Collateralized debt obligation Mortgage-backed security Economy of Pakistan Credit derivative History of the United States (1918-1945) Developing countries' debt FairTax Microeconomics Credit risk Debt levels and flows Economy of Argentina Corporate finance Social Security (United States) Education in the United States Tertiary education fees in Australia Insurance Government National Mortgage Association Taxation in the United States Tennessee State Constitution Life insurance Predatory lending High-yield debt Students' union Bank Estoppel Subsidy Savings and loan association Gold standard Credit history Social Credit Donald Trump Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 12 Divorce Bretton Woods system Password Evan Montvel Cohen Fractional-reserve banking Ra (board game) Refinancing Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Germany Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Economy of the United States Usury Bank fraud Assignment (law) Primerica Financial Services Article One of the United States Constitution Social Security debate (United States) GED Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Mergers and acquisitions Security (finance) Personal finance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Islamic economics SAT National Certificate of Educational Achievement Finance Manchester United F.C.

i'm years young however i can't seem to get a credit card please help i don't have bad credit i just do i don't have credit established at all it will seem silly to some but if you buy something from swiss colony or fingerhut they grant credit to almost anybody spend and make the minimum payment or just a little more until it is paid off then do it again once or twice this will begin a record of positive history for you because these companies always report all it takes is one account in good standing to get things rolling and don't apply for more than one credit card at a time it will make your score plummet for a while  Credit score Credit card Credit history Student loan Billboard Hot 100 Bank Health insurance Internet fraud Social Security (United States) Money Minimum wage Bond Credit card fraud Octopus card Food Stamp Program Bretton Woods system Annuity Life insurance Scrip Schabir Shaik Trial Craps Personal finance Identity theft Arthur Laffer Blackjack Taxation in the United States Topps Graduate school Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Baccarat Sheepshead Surveillance Financial services Deflation (economics) Derivative (finance) Grade (education) Poker jargon Debt Social Credit Draw poker The Isley Brothers Economic history of Spain National Insurance Electronic commerce Micropayment Apprenticeship United Kingdom corporation tax The Walt Disney Company National Football League Mutual fund Fiat money Estoppel Currency Betting (poker) EFTPOS The Canine Mutiny Citigroup Great Depression Mail American Express The Amazing Race Short selling New World First Bus Bank of America CUC International Gross domestic product Auto insurance Public transport Neopets Mortgage Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Corporation Social rule Value added tax Insurance History of the United States (1918-1945) Capitalism Credit rating agency Video poker Legal tender Sydney Riot of 1879 UK Singles Chart Trade union Wachovia Cribbage Gold standard Margin (finance) Duplicate bridge Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Mario Lemieux Refinancing Electronic money Common Agricultural Policy Measures of national income and output Whose Line Is It Anyway?

i have awful credit and cannot afford to pay everything off what should i focus on to better my credit i have quite a bit of old debt a large amount is medical but as a young adult i really messed up my credit i have repo's owe apartment complexes utility companies cell phone and a lot of medical almost all is in collection agencies i do however have one credit card and it is in good standing i would like to improve my credit but what do i pay first i cannot afford to do a debt consolidation and i need to figure out what will make the most impact and improve my credit certain things are getting ready to fall off such as the apartment complexes but i need any suggestions on what to tackle first all help is appreciated make a list of your debts their balances and their requested minimum payments figure out which debts will disappear the fastest by making the minimum payments and put them in order make a budget and figure out how much you can allocate toward your debts every month start at the top of the list and as you pay off your accounts one by one you will be able to allocate that monthly payment to the next debt but remember to always put priority on your accounts in good standing never let them fall behind when dealing with the collection agencies it is best to know exactly what you can afford to pay them so they don't end up pressuring you into paying them more and making your other bills suffer take the amount you have for your debts each month subtract the monthly payments for your accounts that are not in collections you must keep these from going to collections and then take the remainder and divide it among the various collection agencies even if you are only sending them a month at least little by little you will be reducing your debts i have a collection debt for a medical bill that was about i have been sending as much as i can each month to them every month they send me a letter stating that my small payment was appreciated but partial payments will no longer be acceptable and they want the balance in full but every time i send them a small payment they apply it to my balance so apparently every little bit counts as far as the stuff that is about to fall off it can only be on your record for years after the date of first delinquency it is up to you to decide if not paying these debts fits in with your own moral standards financially i would not place emphasis on the oldest ones right now if i were you  Credit card Debt Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bond United Kingdom corporation tax Economy of Russia Microeconomics Unemployment Insurance Credit score Personal finance Health insurance Student loan Government debt Corporate finance Deflation (economics) Taxation in the United States Schabir Shaik Trial Social Security (United States) Advance fee fraud Economy of India Money Bretton Woods system Mortgage Life insurance Bank Internet fraud Virgin Mobile Financial audit Food Stamp Program Surveillance Security (finance) Arthur Laffer Baccarat History of the United States (1918-1945) Tax Keynesian economics United States Postal Service U.S. public debt Betting (poker) Education in the People's Republic of China Divorce Child support Bank fraud Great Depression Salary cap Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Public transport Corporation Collateralized debt obligation Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Interest Article One of the United States Constitution Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Common Agricultural Policy Economy of the United States Monetary policy Capitalism Primerica Financial Services Euro Estoppel Credit history Money supply Capital accumulation Cheque Paul Martin Copyleft Education in Germany Economy of Pakistan Arbitrage National Insurance Jehovah's Witnesses Mail Marshall Plan Weimar Republic Social Security debate (United States) Islamic banking Oil-for-Food Programme Law of value Corporate governance Plame affair Explosive material Economy of Romania Economics Tai Chi Chuan

help my best friend is in big financial trouble her and her husband got into debt for thousand dollars in different credit cards and they can not pay them any more because they have a house payment of a month they recently bought it and can not refinance nor sell it she said she wanst to die even though their credit is good but they can not go on without any money left for food or for their children i'm sorry i can not help her with any money because i don't have any property does any of you know how to help her or does anyone knows where can she get a loan this big to have just one monthly payment so they can go on i have seen her so desperate that i feel so bad not been able to help her thanks for your serious answers no jokes please it's clear that if they are at the point where they have no food they must take drastic action at once to offer specific advice would require knowing more about their situation for example if their annual income is then they can recover with a little time but if their annual income is then they need to consider bankruptcy between the credit cards and the house payment they are probably looking at payments of around a year whether they can avoid bankruptcy is going to depend on their income and other assets if they have no k or retirement savings or other assets they can sell to use towards the credit card bills and there is no possible way they can make the payments today on their current income then another loan is not going to solve their problem i can understand why they would want another loan but it is not going to help i suggest they contact a bankruptcy lawyer to fully evaluate their situation it might be the best thing for them but no one can say for sure without knowing more details  Credit card Personal finance Student loan Mortgage Money Bank Monetary policy Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Deflation (economics) Social Security (United States) Economy of Russia Government debt Donald Trump Life insurance Interest Microeconomics Debt Taxation in the United States Primerica Financial Services Credit score Annuity Capital accumulation Enron Corporation Gold standard Bank fraud 401(k) Marshall Plan Insurance FairTax Economy of India Tax Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Debt consolidation Security (finance) Divorce Social Security debate (United States) Surplus value Mutual fund Hyperinflation Mortgage-backed security Octopus card Financial services History of the United States (1918-1945) Bankruptcy Gross domestic product Credit derivative Micropayment Islamic banking Economy of the United States Asian financial crisis Predatory lending Dividend Citigroup Small business Money supply Mensal__o scandal Commodity markets Refinancing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economy of Africa Economy of Chile Economy of Pakistan PE ratio 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Cheque Derivative (finance) Capitalism Productive and unproductive labour Collateralized debt obligation Securitization Schabir Shaik Trial Great Depression The Amazing Race Warren Buffett Common Agricultural Policy Theory of conduct Temasek Holdings Advance fee fraud Freeters Income trust Anarchist economics Legal tender Real estate bubble Copyleft Health insurance Yield curve Mergers and acquisitions Microcredit Annual percentage rate

improve semi bad credit situation my dad was in the hospital last year and almost died i was with him for about days during this time i missed approx payments on all my loans car loan personal loans credit cards and a wheeler loan once i returned home i quickly returned everything to normal or so i thought now over a year later i have all of the above paid off except for my car but i got denied for a loan the other day when i went to trade my car in i got several letters and they all said the same thing past or present delinquincies now this was just missed payments that were corrected before any went to collections whats the deal here if they are paid off to elaborate all debt but my car payment is paid off completely i was days past due on accounts but only one of the car remain with a balance ok second i dont use credit repair companies and already know they are a scam you can accomplish the same plus more on your own sometimes you can request to have contact information to the person who makes the loan decisions for the organization it's tedious and they may ask you to show documentation from the businesses whose loans you paid in full if you can prove the circumstances and how you continued to pay the loans off that should tell them something there are no guarantees however if they decide to loan you the money you can insist on a decent interest rate you shouldn't be punished when you followed through contact the credit bureaus for a recent credit report you should do this anyway as you have been turned down in the past for a loan the report is free to you hope this helps  Student loan Mortgage Credit card Bank fraud Credit score Debt Credit repair Bank Islamic banking Money Deflation (economics) Bond Personal finance United Kingdom corporation tax Marshall Plan Interest Government debt Life insurance Primerica Financial Services Economy of the United States Predatory lending Social Security (United States) Estoppel Internet fraud Finance 401(k) Child support Bretton Woods system Debt consolidation Great Depression Corporate finance Corporation Monetary policy Collateralized debt obligation Microeconomics Economy of Russia Usury Security (finance) Hillary Rodham Clinton Financial services Economy of Chile Government National Mortgage Association Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Economy of Pakistan Economy of El Salvador Article One of the United States Constitution Citigroup Mail fraud Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Money supply Derivative (finance) Poker jargon Short selling Tertiary education fees in Australia Babylonian law Credit history Mergers and acquisitions Letter of credit Unemployment Contract Mensal__o scandal Scientology beliefs and practices School of Salamanca Donald Trump Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Corporate governance Tax protester History of the United States (1918-1945) Debt levels and flows Islamic economics Credit derivative The Amazing Race Call centre Plame affair Charles Ponzi Economy of India Small business Legal tender Confidence trick Social Credit Mortgage-backed security Municipal bond Health insurance Charles I of England 2005 United States Grand Prix Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Economy of Africa Credit union Tennessee State Constitution

is it true that if you check your credit score it will go down this is not true when you look at your own score it's called a soft pull and does not count against you it's only when you apply for credit and a lender pulls your credit that's a hard pull and counts between points the exception to this is when you apply for a vehicle or home then all inquiries made in a day period only count as one pull they all show on your credit but you are only dinged once  Credit score Ice hockey Credit history Darts Mortgage Student loan Professional wrestling holds Volleyball Pump It Up Predatory lending Softball Baseball Bank Air India Flight 182 Betting (poker) Knife Cribbage Slot machine Suspension bridge Canasta Tire Goal (ice hockey) Archery Drill bit National Certificate of Educational Achievement Computus Deflation (economics) Payday loan Ultimate (sport) Flat tax Monetary policy Interest Blackjack Science Identity theft Lender of last resort Insurance Money supply Wood Credit rating agency Spades Mario Kart: Double Dash!!

can you bump equifax scores using transunions credit checking service i know that you can bump off hard inquires on your credit by having a lot of soft inquires on transunion and equifax but do they post soft inquiries on each others companies no checking your credit with transunion will not affect your equifax or experian scores all three bureaus calculate scores independently the reason that the scores are usually pretty close si taht most companies who report report to all three bureaus but some copmpanies don't report to all three and each bureau uses a slightly different score calculation this is why the score is not the same of all three even though it is usually close i have seen however a difference in score of as much as points in rare cases and inquiries are not bumped off by other inquiries if anything adding more inquiries will lower your score if you are concerned with inquiries don't let anyone pull your credit for at least months inquiries are not counted after a certain length of time but they are not bumped off  TransUnion Credit score Experian Debt consolidation Fair Isaac Corporation Volleyball Credit rating agency Poker jargon Internal ballistics Redundant array of independent disks Plame affair Credit history Strap-on dildo Pinball Equine conformation Grade (education) National Certificate of Educational Achievement 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Plame affair timeline Car handling United Kingdom corporation tax Hutton Inquiry Identity theft Fast bowling Vivian Solon Dog agility SAT ELO rating system Penis FairTax America Online Aerial (dance move) Normal distribution Vowel Blackjack Gomery Commission Israeli Arab Inflation Credit card Archery Bond Financial audit Diving Minesweeper (computer game) Slot machine Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System SS Californian CNN Air India Flight 182 Condom Violin Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004 Darts Supply and demand Heinrich M__ller Pump It Up 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, exit polls Doomsday argument Cribbage Stolen Generation Background check Collision detection Handloading Probation officer Tide Wood Appeal Postcode Trombone Prostate cancer Terminal ballistics Goal (ice hockey) Frequent flyer program Textile manufacturing General intelligence factor Stage lighting Leap second Australian Secret Intelligence Service Sport rowing Australian rules football John Lott Badminton Kurt Cobain Computus David Kelly Roman calendar Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Overclocking Diamond cut Sponsorship scandal Race and intelligence Contesting Pretty Good Privacy Baseball On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences UTF-8 Timeline of the Enron scandal Epistemology Canadian House of Commons Clarinet

how do i know i won't get denied again i just got denied a nebraska furniture mart card due to lack of credit obviously i got a ding for that on my credit score now if i am suppose to apply for a credit card to establish some credit and get denied there is another ding against me how do i know i won't get denied one from say my banks credit card also is there a minimum i have to spend on my credit card each month i agree with my good buddy spifiman to an extent orchard bank's a good place if you're needing to apply for credit they also offer secured credit cards which i'll get into here in a sec but first stay away from capital one and first premier sorry to type in all caps but it's important capital one doesn't report their accounts correctly to the credit bureaus they report whatever your balance is as your credit limit which makes it look like you're always maxing out your card which looks bad for your credit first premier has a lot of upfront fees that are applied before you even get the card let' say that you have a credit limit there could very well be over a in fees that drop the available credit down before you even get to use it so stay away from those cards depending on who you bank with there's a chance that they may offered a secured credit card now i had mentioned this earlier in my answer but you can think of a secured credit card as building credit with a savings account because that's basically how it works a deposit is placed upfront usually tied to a savings account which is used as collateral to get a credit the same amount of the deposit you use it like a regular credit card make small purchases that can be paid off on time every month usually anywhere from months depending on the card either the card converts to a regular card or a better card is offered altogether also you get your deposit back or the savings account isn't used as collateral anymore secured cards are the easiest cards to get approved for i went ahead and posted links to some banks that offer secured credit cards there may be a chance that you bank with one of them i hope this answer helps good luck  Credit card Bank Debit card Mortgage Money Poker jargon Mutual fund Octopus card Bond Betting (poker) Short selling Neopets Taxation in the United States Money supply Internet fraud Surveillance Security (finance) Bank fraud Gold standard Citigroup Blackjack Economy of Russia EFTPOS Identity theft Sears Holdings Corporation Annuity Insurance Automatic teller machine Certificate of deposit Capitalism Advance fee fraud The Joker's Wild Wheel of Fortune Inflation Life insurance Craps Microeconomics Plame affair Gambling Gross domestic product Baccarat Interest Hedge fund Minimum wage Social rule Deflation (economics) Bank of America Personal finance Credit score Article One of the United States Constitution New Deal Wachovia Cheque Credit card fraud Schabir Shaik Trial E-ZPass International League Debt Microcredit Ra (board game) Law of value Monty Hall problem Monetary policy FairTax United States Postal Service Arbitrage Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Economy of India The Amazing Race Theory of conduct Mainframe computer Star Trek Customizable Card Game Jeopardy!

my son is getting turned down for a loan due to my bad credit rating how can i correct this i want my son to have a good credit rating in his own right for a start hun it may not be you that is giving your son a bad credit rating get a copy of his report from equifax creditexpert com have a free day trial online at the mo and have a look and see what is on there what companies don't tell you is if you make more than credit applications every months that automatically gives you a bad credit rating so if you son has applied for loans and say credit card the next time he applies he will automatically get turned down through this reason alone if this doesn't apply to him and the credit report shows no late payments on anything trying not to be patronising here so forgive me a little green circle is a payment made on time a yellow a late one and red means no payment made then what you can do is to have him dissassociated from your house but before you do that you have to look at his credit report and how old is your son bear in mind if he's only there's a highly likely chance that he won't get credit automatically because no credit is worse than bad credit if you've gone through every possibility and you're absoloutely sure that it is because of you than you can either contact your or your son's bank manager or give equifax themselves a call and they'll tell you how to go about disassociating him from you but that is obviously a last step good luck xx  Credit score Student loan Credit card Bank Mortgage Credit history Bond Bank fraud United Kingdom corporation tax Octopus card Internet fraud Deflation (economics) Social rule Credit repair Credit rating agency Citigroup Blackjack Debt Annuity Theory of conduct Bretton Woods system Primerica Financial Services Keynesian economics Interest Auto insurance TransUnion Financial services Identity theft Micropayment Islamic banking The Amazing Race Poker jargon Skype David Beckham Credit card fraud Monetary policy Life insurance Government debt Draw poker Sheepshead United States Postal Service Corporate finance Snooker Backgammon Certificate of deposit Microcredit Copyleft Economy of El Salvador Galactic Civilizations Mergers and acquisitions Hyperinflation Wheel of Fortune Gold standard Government National Mortgage Association Refinancing Social Credit Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Tour de France FairTax Insurance Virgin Mobile Wachovia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Finance Windows XP Digital rights management Prisoner's dilemma Monopoly (game) Call centre Payday loan A Course In Miracles Craps Business performance management ELO rating system Health insurance Experian Credit default swap 401(k) Deficit spending Cheating in poker Pump It Up Lottery Derivative (finance) New York Knicks Knife Corporation Electronic money Collateralized debt obligation Beatmania IIDX Appeal Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)

bad credit want to earn credit with current credit card i have bad credit i finally got a credit card and can start earning my credit i've been told two seperate stories regarding paying for my credit cards payments to earn those credits i was told the if i make monthly payments and not pay my balance although i have to pay to stupid finance charges that's a way to earn credit so i was told to do that for months to a year and my credit will improve the second one i was told was that i have to pay my cc bills in full every month in order to get better credit ratings and also to avoid finance charges so which one is correct make monthly payments have a balance and pay finance charges or pay my cc bills in full every month and not get charged on interests you should make regular purchases that is one you will normally pay cash for on your credit card then at the end of the month pay it in full and on time to avoid the interest charges what happens is that the credit card company will report your high balance for the month so if you charge they will report your balance of if you pay it off and then charge the next month your balance is reported as there is no way creditors will know if you made a payment of or paid the balance and charged another one important factor is your utilization so for the best help you should not be using more than of your limit at any one time that is if you have a credit limit of you don't want to use more than in any one month  Credit card Credit score Bond United Kingdom corporation tax Debt Insurance PE ratio Mortgage Annuity Personal finance Interest Islamic banking Primerica Financial Services Mutual fund Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Deflation (economics) Taxation in the United States Life insurance 401(k) Corporate finance Cheque FairTax Citigroup Enron Corporation Food Stamp Program Internet fraud Economy of Russia Collateralized debt obligation Credit derivative Health insurance Schabir Shaik Trial Virgin Mobile Refinancing Octopus card Dividend Bretton Woods system Bank fraud Gold standard Treasury security Money Municipal bond Betting (poker) Tom DeLay Accounting methods Financial audit Security (finance) Pension Surveillance Wal-Mart Monetary policy Ponzi scheme Oyster card Wachovia Gross domestic product Government debt MetroCard Copyleft Short selling Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Credit history Microeconomics Debt consolidation American Express The Amazing Race Economy of Pakistan Legal tender Predatory lending Futures contract Economy of India Arbitrage Credit repair Actuarial notation Publicly funded medicine Mortgage-backed security Government National Mortgage Association Financial services Auto insurance Amway Federal National Mortgage Association Tax Derivative (finance) Timeline of the Enron scandal Electronic money Stock Micropayment Payday loan London Congestion Charge Debit card Certificate of deposit National Insurance Hire purchase History of the United States (1918-1945) Hyperinflation Campaign finance reform

help i'm dealing w almost non exitant countrywide customer service re getting removal of report on credit my hubby is not good at small details and really screwed up bad i am left find out how fix this issue we own rental homes of the mortgages are thru c on only of the homes our impound account went up a mo due a large insurance increase we pay electronically from our bank every mo with this in place tim doesnt open monthly paper bill statements was not aware of the increase he had paid months of payments before cwl called us to say that they had been declining our original payment and that we are months past due in foreclosure my hubby paid total due within days i regret we didnt negotiate that any derogatory credit statements made would be removed from credit cwl didnt even let the ink dry on our check before they really dinged our credit keep in mind we were paying accts on time for years when we call them about it they have literally left us on hold for hours waiting speak the department rep still no answer while i appreciate your input it sounds as if you are questioning the facts to my question twisting my statement would not be to my advantage as i am on yahoo questions trying to get help from those who truly have insight to this issue if i was not at my writing limit i had planned on questioning their decision to return a sure thing payment they could have added the mi my additional escrow needed this you pay once a year to settle up any money your are over budget for in this day of so many foreclosures i think they would want anything they can get getting a house back is a time money loser for them not to mention we have another mortgage with them as for the couple counseling i have been onto him for years to always read financial statements promptly they are all sent to our po box in which he is in charge of you must pick your battles he is paying for his mistake by my bitching at him for this big mess plus the financial hard hit in your situation i would first tell you the fact the ach payments were being declined by cw in the first place is non sense they should by all means accept your ach payment your escrow account or impound account is only a part of your agreement with the bank for your leisure and their guarantee you will have your property insured and your taxes paid having that said it in no way is part of the binding loan agreement mortgage with the lender they can not require you escrow or impound your taxes or insurance therefore to reject your payment because it didn't include the increased escrow or impound amount is inevitably not within legal mortgage protocol i think the fact you so quickly paid the account to current only shows good faith on your part and should only aid in your bargaining with cwl with regards to having the erroneous reporting removed from your records lastly to get a hold of someone at cwl i would recommend either being a trooper and waiting it out on hold or contacting the attorney general in your state they would be able to guide you on how to contact cwl to resolve the problem as well as be able to file a formal complaint against cwl for public record if worse comes to worst call the main number and just keep pushing if you do that usually the automated system assumes you're either elderly or unable incapacitated and otherwise don't have the ability to dial the right numbers options this will in turn put you in the priority hold queue for a real person to speak with you about what you need make sure to document the time and date you called every time you speak with them how long the call lasted how much of the call you were on hold anything you were guaranteed or promised from the representative and lastly make sure to get their name and either their extension or operator employee number nothing worse than being promised something by an inept moron then have what was promised you not happen and then not be able to hold their feet to the fire for it good luck hope this helps  Life insurance Bank Credit card Student loan Social Security (United States) United Kingdom corporation tax Call centre Taxation in the United States Great Depression

how badly is your credit affected if you forget to pay your credit card i'm usually on time paying but i plain forgot to pay my credit card bill this month and was about a little over a week late paying it back this is the first time i've ever been late on a payment for my credit card and i'm a bit worried that later on if i go to apply for a house or car this could affect my status seeing how this is reported to credit score companies is being late once on your payments that bad as long as you pay it before you are days late nothing even gets reported to your credit report so if you paid it only a week late you will be fine however you may have accidentally kicked into a higher interest rate and had a late fee assessed because you were late but this only effects that credit card and is not noted on your credit report  Credit card Bond Student loan London Congestion Charge Taxation in the United States United Kingdom corporation tax Internet fraud Credit history Insurance Deflation (economics) Interest Debt consolidation Mortgage Life insurance Personal finance Minimum wage Government debt Bank Debt Money Health insurance New York Giants Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Credit default swap Auto insurance Credit card fraud Primerica Financial Services Octopus card FairTax Municipal bond Cable television Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 EFTPOS Wachovia Public transport Telephone card Economy of Russia Unemployment Treasury security Predatory lending Futures contract National Insurance Dividend Micropayment Data retention Advance fee fraud Islamic banking Credit rating agency Gold standard Refinancing Richard Perle National Football League British national identity card Estoppel Phishing Mail Debit card Government National Mortgage Association James T.

is there a minimum credit score before you can get a home loan i have heard that is a magic number for home loans but don't know if this is true what are the odds of getting approved if you are under hi some lenders do have mortgage products that have minimum credit score requirements but we have hundreds of mortgage products available many without credit scores and even a few that allow recent bankruptcy you will get a lower interest rate with higher credit scores but you can be approved for a loan that rewards good payment history by lowering your rate periodically you should contact a lender and discuss your options i suggest a credit union as they have more favorable mortgage products with much easier qualifications than banks and have much lower closing costs and fees than banks and brokers it will help your score and chance of approval if you have long term employment and at least down payment be sure to ask the lender if compensating factors such as this employment and cash reserves will help you qualify for a more favorable program  Insurance Bond Debt Taxation in the United States Life insurance Credit card Economy of Russia Annual percentage rate Government National Mortgage Association Monetary policy Mortgage-backed security Finance Primerica Financial Services Central bank Subsidy Real estate broker Credit score Gold standard Financial markets History of the United States (1918-1945) Mutual fund 401(k) Federal National Mortgage Association Debt consolidation Economy of India Short selling Capitalism Inflation Money Yield curve Title insurance Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Savings and loan association Economy of the United States Payday loan Education in the People's Republic of China Real estate bubble Derivative (finance) Government debt FairTax Lawyer Mergers and acquisitions Great Depression Microcredit Islamic economics Compensation of employees Lender of last resort Bretton Woods system Social Security (United States) Annuity Consumer finance Article One of the United States Constitution Personal finance Corporate finance Graduate school Social Security debate (United States) ELO rating system Education in the United States Donald Trump Security (finance) Affirmative action Privatization Collateralized debt obligation Futures contract ACORN Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Arbitrage Divorce Free trade Minimum wage Collateralized mortgage obligation Capital accumulation Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Repurchase agreement Savings and Loan crisis Economy of Pakistan Rational pricing Flat tax Stock Unemployment Financial services Money supply
