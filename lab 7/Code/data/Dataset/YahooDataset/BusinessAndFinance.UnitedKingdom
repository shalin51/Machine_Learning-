why do we get taxed more when we have nd jobs i currently have jobs but i get taxed so much on my nd job its almost not worth me working a nd job why do we get taxed so much on nd jobs its like we get punished for it it's not like you get punished for it it's you are punished for it by having a second job you are then in a higher income level that punishment is that you get hit with bigger deductions as though you had that income as a regular job one job if you keep that second job year round then the deductions will reflect it fairly er it is obvious that all deductions are way out of line because you must file an income tax return to get back what the gov stole from you and just look at how much the gov wastes on useless expenses i beieve that there should be a flat tax say and a tax return is not required this goes for all citizens no return no cheating no phoney baloney period  Flat tax 401(k) Taxation in the United States Income tax Microeconomics United Kingdom corporation tax FairTax Social Security (United States) Self-employment Depreciation Sport utility vehicle Life insurance Income trust Wal-Mart Progressive tax Form 1040 Tax avoidance/evasion Welfare trap Tax deduction Food Stamp Program Annuity National Insurance Inflation Mutual fund Tax protester Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Cheating in Counter-Strike Efficiency wages Surplus value Arguments for and against drug prohibition United States Postal Service Alcohol fuel Compensation of employees Reaganomics Barbara Boxer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Productive and unproductive labour Hybrid vehicle Credit card $ale of the Century Registered Retirement Savings Plan Tax bracket Kansas Guaranteed minimum income Article One of the United States Constitution Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Warren Buffett Negative income tax Domestic partnerships in California Student loan Insurance Poker jargon Publicly funded medicine Biodiesel Health insurance Property tax George W.

explain the net of tax im am doing a project over an annual report and i'm trying to figure out return on assets the equation in the book is shown as return on assets net income interest expense multiplied by net of tax which is a percentage divided by average total assets and in the example in the book it shows the interest expense being multiplied by a net of tax percentage and i do not know how they got that percentage or how to get it myself please help i got the rest of the information but i can't get teh percentage the net of tax calculation is being used to determine the company profits before interest and taxes also known as ebit earning before interest and taxes the percentage you should be using is the marginal tax rate for the business which in a text book example like you describe above would be given to you since you are working with a real life example from an annual report you will have to make the calculation yourself the easiest is to take their profits and simply add back in the interest and tax indicated on the company profit and loss statement this will get you their ebit which is probably already listed as an interim total on their profit and loss statement if you are wanting to use the percentage calculation then you would need to determine what percentage their marginal tax rate is this too is a simple formula tax amount earnings tax amount good luck  Tax Microeconomics United Kingdom corporation tax Income statement Mutual fund Gross domestic product Inflation Profit Depreciation Dividend FairTax Insurance Cost of capital Corporate finance Personal finance 401(k) Deflation (economics) Dividend imputation Income EBITDA Productive and unproductive labour Property tax Taxation in the United States Capital accumulation Bond Financial services Keynesian economics Progressive tax Annuity Islamic banking Capitalism PE ratio Social Security debate (United States) Interest Capital controversy Credit card Weighted average cost of capital Life insurance Derivative (finance) National Insurance Capital gains tax Inheritance tax Futures contract Transformation problem Flat tax Labor theory of value Bank Economics Value product Income trust Valuation (finance) Wealth condensation Multiplier (economics) Wealth Value added tax Economic inequality Margin of error Lloyd's of London IAS 36: Impairment of Assets Economy of India Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Labour economics Economic rent Accounting methods Exponential growth Tax deduction Corporation Law of value Salary cap IAS 22: Business Combinations Hyperinflation Tariff Ra (board game) Donald Trump Airline Variable universal life insurance Asset Money creation Mergers and acquisitions Intellectual property Annual percentage rate Explosive material Production theory basics U.S. public debt Compensation of employees Security (finance) Prices of production Profit maximization Tax haven Warren Buffett Margin (finance) </TEXT>
