this is a two part question please answer seriously a what is the most likely way for someone age to become stinking rich b and say that person gets rich what s the most likely way for him to loose all his money every last cent of it and i m not talking about instant riches like winning the lottery but i am talking about instant bankruptcy i m not asking because i would like to become rich or anything i want to write a novel but i first want to figure out a believable storyline so answer seriously and please stay from answers that have to do with drugs or things like that thanks the most likely way is probably not the most creative way to grab reader's attention and interest like the most likely way is that they inherit it win a lottery or lawsuit or get a new idea business or become famous through acting sports or stock trading the most interesting way to tell a story is to grab the reader with something that they would not think about happening like recently someone found a shipwreck with untold fortunes in ancient gold silver and other precious metal coins and artifacts this is very compelling as it could happen to anyone that scubas in an unexpected place as far as losing the money there are the typical ways like gambling divorce liability suits paternity or other claims against the new found wealth but maybe you could work in a natural or terrorist disaster that consumes not only the wealth of the protagonist but those in a region or specific population like an earthquake in san francisco that devastated the market district and the guy's money was invested in a skycraper or something similar believability is a flexible thing depending on each reader most believe that two airplanes caused the twin towers at the world trade center to fall down i don't believe that for an instant now at the time i did also believability depends on how well you support the story line with 'the facts' of the incidents 'are there believable alternatives that cause disbelief common sense rules out a lot of things that sound good but as the plot gets thicker do the story facts play out then as well good luck on that novel which means 'new or unique charlie  Insurance Capital accumulation Microeconomics Capitalism Commodity markets Gold standard Theory of conduct Ra (board game) Money Primitive accumulation of capital Deflation (economics) Neopets Wheel of Fortune Arthur Laffer Gambling Frank Herbert Economics FairTax A Course In Miracles Coercion Trade Great Depression September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for the day of the attacks Dot-com Intellectual property Scrooge McDuck Wealth Contract Anarchism and capitalism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Productive and unproductive labour Theodicy Supernatural Days of our Lives Fractional-reserve banking Goodness and value theory Ethical consumerism Tourism Political economy Species Game show Gross domestic product Scientology beliefs and practices Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Joker's Wild Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Divorce Labor theory of value Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!

can banks charge without an agreement my bank charges a fee for overdrafts i told them i don't agree to a fee they said that if i overdraft i must pay the fee a buddy of mine was overdrawn by they transferred the funds from his savings to his checking to cover the overdraft and they charged him for the overdraft is this legal the choice is between bouncing the check and letting the check go thru but charging an overdraft fee there is a lot of debate about overdraft fees at the moment but there is no law saying they are illegal however they may be part of your contract with your bank either they are in the original checking agreement or the bank sent a notice some time after that stating they were adding overdraft fees to the agreement of course a bouncing check creates extra fees for everyone so it's a choice between two evils the fees should be regulated since some banks put the checks thru in such a way as to create as many overdraft fees as possilbe for example let's say you have a check and checks for each and your balance is the bank could put thru the small checks and only charge an overdraft fee on the big one but in practice they will put thru the big one and charge you overdraft fees on the small ones write your congressman and senators and complain  Credit card Bob McEwen Advance fee fraud Bank Poker jargon Insurance SCO-Linux controversies Internet fraud Mortgage Leasing Debit card Schabir Shaik Trial Copyright Food and Drug Administration United States Postal Service Money creation Trust (Law) USA Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Israeli settlement Short selling The Wildhearts Congress of the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Jack Abramoff Article One of the United States Constitution Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Betting (poker) Usury New Deal Citigroup Security (finance) Monetary policy United States House of Representatives GNU General Public License International Criminal Court Fiat money Microeconomics Education in Portugal Spyware Redundant array of independent disks International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict Cheque Public domain Gold standard Notary public London Congestion Charge Money supply Contract National Kidney Foundation Singapore Cable television Corporate finance George Galloway Octopus card European Union Celtic F.C.

interest on money i read in a book once that banks in the uk pay interest on very large eg more than sums of money on a daily rather than anual basis is this true interest is usually paid on funds invested on a monthly or annual basis there may be some banks which may pay interest daily however these are likely to be by separate negotiation with the client there are a great number of cash funds which earn interest daily but most often bank accounts will pay their interest monthly even so the interest accrues daily so for days invested days of interest is received does this make sense  Mutual fund Bond Bank Interest Institutional fund management Insurance Credit card Life insurance Corporate finance Social Security (United States) Short selling Finance Personal finance Security (finance) Bank fraud Retirement plan Monetary policy Student loan Derivative (finance) Investment bank Citigroup Pension Deflation (economics) Mortgage Mergers and acquisitions Financial services Capital accumulation Mensal__o scandal Hyperinflation Dividend Islamic banking Variable universal life insurance Primerica Financial Services Debt United Kingdom corporation tax U.S. public debt Money supply 401(k) Trust (Law) USA Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Economy of Russia Treasury security Financial markets Internet fraud Money creation Privatization National Kidney Foundation Singapore FairTax Tax Financial analyst Marshall Plan Ponzi scheme John Maynard Keynes PE ratio Anarchism and capitalism Zero coupon bond Corporate governance Social Security debate (United States) Bank of China (Hong Kong) Cheque Bretton Woods system Equity swap Yield curve Goldman Sachs Income trust MMORPG Gross domestic product Economy of Africa Gambling Salary cap New Deal Stock Hedge fund Lloyd's of London Offshore bank Collateralized debt obligation Cooperative Keynesian economics Taxation in the United States Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Rational pricing Economy of Romania Federal Reserve Economic rent Palestinian National Authority Islamic economics Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Microcredit Inflation Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Economy of India Employment in Hong Kong Charles Ponzi Member of the European Parliament Repurchase agreement Temasek Holdings Television licence World Bank Group Confidence trick

roth ira investing k stocks okay so i don't know the first thing to investing money and i figure i should start to learn since i will be finishing college soon my economics teacher was telling us that if a person invests a good amount of money in roth ira they could be multi millionaire's by the time they retire so could someone tell me what the roth ira is and how does it work how do you know where to invest your money i hear about things like fidelity and mutual funds how do those work what is k how does it work is it a gamble to invest in stocks sorry for all the questions somebody was saying that the smart people invest their money before taxes and others invest after taxes if you invest before taxes do you make more money also if i'm but i got the money from savings birthday graduation gifts can i use it what i'm saying is do you have to be employed roth iras are basically iras funded with aftertax dollars since you are taxed on the money going in you are not taxed on the money coming out the earnings if you fund one when your tax rate is low like when you st start working you can end up having a fortune to draw out in your old age tax free there is also a neat thing called a roth k into which you your emplyer can contribute it works the same way traditional iras ks allow you to put in pretax dollars but your earnings will be taxed when you begin drawing them out at retirement money in any of these accounts can be invested in mutual funds some iras can also be invested in real estate etc investing in individual stocks is risky unless you make being informed about business news your primary occupation mutual funds are a better bet because you can own little bits of up to companies that way if more go up than down you have made money a decent mutual fund can easily average yr btw do not apologize for asking all this stuff i wish i'd known it all when i graduated i'm a freakin' accountant but i was an idiot with money your eco prof sounds like a bright person pick his her brain in your free time also pick up the books below between them you will get a very clear picture of how to manage your finances for your own best long term benefit  Mutual fund 401(k) Individual Retirement Account Roth IRA Warren Buffett Annuity Bond Gross domestic product Capital accumulation Life insurance Corporate finance Social Security (United States) Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Finance Variable universal life insurance Retirement plan Bank Money supply Microeconomics Microcredit Taxation in the United States Tax Hedge fund Deflation (economics) Personal finance Anarchism and capitalism Income trust Economy of Russia FairTax Institutional fund management Financial services Trust (Law) USA Bank fraud Citigroup Gambling Security (finance) Individual Savings Account Corporation Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Investment bank Pension Capitalism Health savings account Surplus value Economy of India Student loan Goldman Sachs Minimum wage Monetary policy National Kidney Foundation Singapore Eugene Fama Unemployment benefit Inflation Asian financial crisis Education in the United States Dividend United Kingdom corporation tax Mad Money Confidence trick Enron Corporation Dave Ramsey Modern portfolio theory Deficit spending Hyperinflation Primerica Financial Services Advance fee fraud Health insurance Islamic banking Economy of the United States Wells Fargo Wheel of Fortune Reaganomics John Maynard Keynes Education in the People's Republic of China Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Stock market Economic inequality Economics Mergers and acquisitions Government debt TIAA-CREF Stanley Ho Ken Jennings Gold standard Ross School of Business Arturo Frondizi

i need help finding on line grocery store coupons with no requirement to give personal information i've been looking for two hours and all the ones i find ask for participation in surveys my e mail address etc i don't need a bunch of spam i just need some simple grocery coupons i'm a single mom on a teachers salary who receives no child support help pretty much any website is going to ask for your email address i recommend setting up an email account only for spam any time you sign up for a website that isn't crucially important use the spam email address instead of your regular email address then you don't have to bother with the emails you can just glance over them when you want to without being bothered by them on a daily basis nothing is free i'm afraid coupons are a marketing tool at the least places that offer coupons are going to want your basic information so that they can use it for statistical purposes most also want your email address so that they can send you links to the latest sales and coupons and other deals the occasional snail mail surveys aren't too bad i fill them out and tend to get some nice coupons in the mail from them other than newspapers i recommend signing up at the actual stores or with the actual companies that you use if you shop at food lion sign up at their website all grocery stores that i know of offer online coupons if you sign up with them and use their discount cards they also send weekly emails that list all of the daily or weekly sales which is great for making grocery lists and getting the best discounts if you buy a lot of a particular product try going to their company website and signing up with them directly i use a lot of coffee and creamer for instance i went to the brand websites and signed up with them and now i get coupons for dollars off of their products quite regularly in email same for shampoo products etc it's amazing how easy it is to get a couple dollars off of what you like if you just give them your email address the same goes for many restaurants if you sign up at their sites with almost all of these actual company sites they don't require many if any surveys and they don't send excessive spam they also don't send you in circles or threaten your computer with mal ware or viruses be very careful about offbeat websites that offer free stuff they are usually full of scams and trouble anything that has free in the title is usually a scam of some sort you might also like to check out the grocery game i used it for a while but finally gave it up because my printer blew up so i couldn't print out the lists and coupons and i didn't have the time to shop that smartly on a regular basis but not only do they offer coupons regularly they also have detailed listings for every grocery store and they tell you when you should use which coupons for the best savings it's very neat if you have an extra hour or so a week to compile your grocery list print things out and organize all your coupons you can save a great deal of money with them and their bi monthly fee is quite cheap  Advance fee fraud Internet fraud Stopping e-mail abuse Make money fast Gmail Neopets Computer virus Phishing Wal-Mart Direct marketing Charles Ponzi Surveillance Viral marketing Sears Holdings Corporation Blog Pretty Good Privacy Mail fraud MapleStory Email authentication Theory of conduct Bond Aldi Electronic commerce Microeconomics Computer Loyalty program Supermarket Sender Policy Framework RuneScape cheats CPU cache Octopus card United States Postal Service Mac OS X System/36 Price discrimination Sales promotion Bulk vending Confidence trick The Standard Search engine optimization Usenet Spam Prevention Early Warning System Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Tesco CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 MMORPG Plame affair Windows XP Sudoku CPU design Apple Open Collaboration Environment The Amazing Race Copyleft The Apprentice 2 Linked list Statistical survey Credit card Management Digital photography Advertising Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act ITunes Music Store Anonymous remailer Bluetooth Hash table Mozilla Application Suite Retailer 2channel Floppy disk System/34 Mach kernel Electronic Arts Oil-for-Food Programme Wheel of Fortune Mail-order bride UK Singles Chart Poker jargon Pontianak, Indonesia Perl FidoNet Gross domestic product Target Corporation Walt Disney World College Program Domain Name System Management information system FairTax Whois Opera (web browser) Linux Am730 Wall Street Life insurance

is it a good idea i really really need a loan of around pounds but because im just and have a minimum wage job its hard finding a loan so is it a good idea if i get credit cards and take thousand from each because you only pay back around each month surely thats a good idea if i cant get a loan any advice would be great thanks i would advise against it if there is any way you can possibly not borrow that money then it is definately worth considering alternatives if you need to borrow now you will end up paying a lot more than that back and in a few years you will be in even more trouble these things have a way of escalating it really depends on what the money is for if it really is a matter of life and death then i would speak to friends and family about whether they could possibly help you out they are likely to have much better terms of lending than a loan company who are out there just to make money i advise you to think very carefully before jumping into anything  Deflation (economics) Life insurance Bank Hyperinflation Credit card Interest Gold standard Predatory lending Insurance Debt Bond Microcredit Inflation Monetary policy Finnish language Mortgage Minimum wage Social Credit Capitalism Government debt Capital accumulation Debt consolidation Bretton Woods system Schabir Shaik Trial Short selling Microeconomics Islamic banking Financial markets Finance School of Salamanca Marshall Plan Marcus Licinius Crassus Economy of Russia Sweatshop Stock Social Security (United States) Charles Ponzi Fiat money Variable universal life insurance Graduate school Money supply Poker jargon Free trade Savings and loan association 401(k) Yield curve The Merchant of Venice John Kerr Economy of the United States Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Keynesian economics Subsidy Security (finance) Money creation Fixed income History of the United States (1918-1945) Betting (poker) Theory of conduct Islamic economics Alcoholics Anonymous ACORN Edward Gibbon Wakefield Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Arbitrage Surplus value Federal Reserve Supply-side economics Financial services Mutual fund Primerica Financial Services Great Depression Savings and Loan crisis Advance fee fraud Annual percentage rate Mortgage-backed security Evan Montvel Cohen Public policy Bank fraud Currency Donald Trump Anarchism and capitalism Avenue Q Economics Refinancing Wal-Mart Payday loan Pitaten Credit history Trust (Law) USA Personal finance Education in the United States Social rule Debt levels and flows

what is the best way to start i've never filled taxes owned a credit card or anything i've always used cash i want to be in good standing with these things seeing as i have no status with it how do i start i'm thinking about hiring a financial advisor and tax agent or something to start this process of building my credit history but i don't think i have the money for that rigth now but i know i have to file taxes this year since i'm also starting my first job i don't want to end up like these people in debt and living paycheck to paycheck i also want to start a roth ira i'm young but i want to be secure can anyone point me in the right direction with these things taxes credit saving retirement this is what i want to get in order any advise good question as you will need some financial visibility i am assuming you have a social security number it will also help if you have an existing bank account if not you can ride on your parent's bank you can start with looking for a bank or credit union in your area that offer what is called a secured credit card this means that you give the bank some money say which they will put aside on a term investment e g a time deposit or a bank certificate this will be used by the bank as collateral on your credit card and this will be your credit limit using this secured credit card purchase items that are affordable and be sure to pay off the balance every month i suggest getting items that will ensure a monthly bill like a cellphone this will ensure that your name is on a credit database with a retailer that reports to your local credit union like your credit card pay the bills on time use your credit card and pay it off every month keep within your limit most banks will have on line banking and you can use this to track your purchases as well as your remaining credit do not max out and do not purchase what you cannot afford ideally buy things for which you already have the money but instead of using cash use the card and then in the evening use the cash to pay the card off the nice thing about credit cards is you can pay bit by bit within the month until the balance is paid off before due date too many people wait for the bill don't wait for the bill when you buy pay off secured credit cards are usually given a limit of year after the year is over the bank may give you the option of removing the security and subject to approval turn it into a non secured card by this time your security deposit will have also grown a bit mistakes people make do not start with mall cards interest is too high no on line payment facility apply to all the credit card companies you can find of these companies assume you have existing credit and will check with the credit bureaus if you have insufficient credit for their requirements they will deny you this is recorded in the bureau the more denials you have the lower your score gets so if you are starting out you may just have zeroed yourself out more talk to your

atm question last night i was out partying and tried to take money out of an atm that was at this bar the atm was taking a long time so i canceled the transaction but my online banking shows the money was taken out what should i do has this ever happened to anyone does my bank have to give me the money back and is there any way that i can prove i did not get the money the only way to get your money back is to file a dispute with your bank call the bank and ask them what you need to do to file an atm dispute make sure it is in writing if they don't have a form to fill out then you should write a letter stating your dispute you only have so many days to file a dispute it may vary from bank to bank so don't delay they will need the date of your transaction your account and also the amount disputed the receipt from your transaction if you got one may help but it shouldn't be needed also be honest with yourself if you were drinking and can't remember clearly then don't assume the atm took your money atms almost never cancel your transaction and don't refund the money however you can still submit a dispute if you are unclear and then let the bank sort it out after they recieve your dispute and pass it on to the processing network the atm owner will have only so many days to send in records from the atm if the atm shows any sort of malfunctioning on or near your transaction then you will get your money you will also get your money if the atm owner doesn't send in any records the only way you will not get anything back is if the atms records indicate that it successfully dispensed the funds if they do refund your money make sure they also refund any surcharge that was added on  Automatic teller machine EFTPOS Password Credit card Bank fraud Credit card fraud Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act United States Postal Service Bank Advance fee fraud Octopus card Annuity Taxation in the United States Asynchronous Transfer Mode Postage stamp Money supply File system Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Theory of conduct Life insurance Article One of the United States Constitution Database Surveillance Enron Corporation Monetary policy Mergers and acquisitions Domain Name System Mutual fund Plame affair Contract Wheel of Fortune Islamic banking Windows XP SCO-Linux controversies Euro Microsoft Jet Database Engine Internet fraud Mortgage Popular, Inc MetroCard Medical prescription Money SmartRider Automated Clearing House Congestion control MTR The X-Files Derivative (finance) PayPal Chip and PIN Citigroup Backup Identity theft 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression GunZ The Duel Siphon Craps Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Stanley Cup Insurance BancNet Family Feud Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Anarchism and capitalism Liberty Dollar Btrieve Investment bank Poker jargon Financial markets Bond Money creation Jeopardy!

how do you fix your credit to get a home loan hi shelly here are a few tips that will help raise your credit score but some will take time if you haven t pulled your credit report recently it would be wise to pull it and check for inaccuracies and report them to the credit bureaus pay your bills on time this is the best way to improve your score and it's never too late to start even if you've had serious delinquencies in the past those will count less over time if you keep paying your bills on time keep credit card balances low this might not be as relevant to you because you mentioned you re trying to get a credit card but when you do keep the balance low better yet pay it full every mo check your credit report for accuracy it s possible that there may be inaccurate information on your credit report that can be easily cleared up if this proves to be the case then you should contact one of the three credit reporting agencies transunion experian or equifax pay off debt rather than moving it around consolidating your credit card debt onto one card or spreading it over multiple cards will not improve your score in the long run the most effective way to improve your score is by simply paying down the amount you owe keep your credit cards but manage them responsibly in general having credit cards and installment loans that you pay on time will raise your score someone who has no credit cards tends to have a lower score than someone who has managed credit cards responsibly don't open multiple accounts too quickly especially if you have a short credit history opening too many accounts in too short of a time period can look risky because you are taking on a lot of possible debt new accounts will also lower the average age of your existing accounts something that your fico score also considers don't open new credit card accounts you don't need this approach could backfire and actually lower your score don't close an account to remove it from your record it s a myth that closing an account removes it from your credit report this is untrue even closed accounts remain on your report possibly for an indefinite period of time and may still be factored into the score in fact closing accounts can sometimes hurt your score unless you also pay down your debt at the same time shop for a loan within a short focused period of time fico scores distinguish between a search for a single loan and a search for many new credit lines based in part on the length of time over which recent requests for credit occur if you shop for a number of loans over too long a time period it can count against you contact your creditors or see a legitimate credit counselor if you're having financial difficulties this won't improve your score immediately but the sooner you begin managing your credit well and making timely payments the sooner your score will get better i ve included a link to our credit guide but if you have any questions feel free to contact me through my profile good luck  Credit card Mortgage Debt Bond Student loan Deflation (economics) Betting (poker) Bank TransUnion United Kingdom corporation tax Interest Money Bank fraud Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Gold standard FairTax Annuity Credit history Economy of Russia Insurance Extreme Programming Credit repair Money supply Keynesian economics Dog agility Plame affair Blackjack Hearts (game) Child support Internet fraud Security (finance) Corporate finance Microeconomics Debt levels and flows Bretton Woods system Primerica Financial Services Personal finance Estoppel Corporation Inflation Fair Isaac Corporation Gross domestic product Social Security (United States) U.S. public debt Identity theft Supply and demand Windows XP Schabir Shaik Trial Taxation in the United States Advance fee fraud Cheque Credit rating agency The Amazing Race Octopus card Surveillance Contract bridge Phishing CPU cache Mutual fund Islamic banking Credit derivative Leeds United F.C.

why do we go to work we pay bills and barley make enough to eat how do we make more money i ask myself that question every single day there must be an easy way i think one of the best ways to make more money though is to show initiative in your current job work hard make yourself indispensible and hopefully your manager boss will reward you also save and invest what money you do have left over compound your interest it will take some time but eventually you will have saved enough to live off the interest your savings generate  Freeters Mutual fund Interest Deflation (economics) 401(k) Money Live 8 Annuity New Deal Anarchism and capitalism Inflation Labor theory of value Supply-side economics Capitalism Personal finance Life insurance Charles Ponzi Hillary Rodham Clinton Bond Ponzi scheme Keynesian economics FairTax Gross domestic product Credit card Social Security debate (United States) Unemployment benefit Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus PE ratio Investment bank Insurance Divine grace Bank Wealth condensation The Sims Stock Eric Bischoff Say's law Social Security (United States) Hyperinflation Warren Buffett Financial markets Newcastle United F.C.

closing one part of a joint bank account i recently opened a joint bank account with a friend and now my parent disapproves of it i was wondering if i can take my name off the account without actually closing the entire account and do i have to be there when they take my name off of it thanks btw the bank is wamu if that helps he's the primary holde r im just a minor underhis account and i want my own name removed from it you can remove yourself from the account at any time but you must do it in person and provide id etc the reason is that anyone could remove you and the bank could not prove who they were they need to verify your signature etc and you have to provide proof that you are the person named on the account it's simply a matter of signing a form relinquishing your rights to the account the other person on the account will have to go in and sign a new signature card especially if the account had specific signing requirements such as both people must sign cheques and withdrawal slips etc accounts can have either party or both parties just to be certain read your account terms you should have gotten a copy when the account was opened it will tell you if the account must be closed completely to remove you as a joint owner they will also restrict access via atm until a new access code is submitted by the remaining account holder  Octopus card Password Automatic teller machine Bank fraud Public domain Public-key cryptography Identity theft Cheque Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Credit card fraud Pretty Good Privacy Euro Trademark Debit card Digital rights management Freedom of information legislation Bank of China (Hong Kong) Concurrent estate Driver's license Bank Surveillance Chip and PIN Life insurance Gmail Cyprus dispute Digital signature Identity document Contract Phishing Copyright Intellectual property GNU General Public License MAME Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 E-mail spam Israeli settlement Patent Polyamory Israeli West Bank barrier Schabir Shaik Trial Traveler's cheque Gold standard Mortgage Enterprise content management Administrative law of the United States Trusted computing Indian nationality law RFID Copyright law of the United Kingdom Australian electoral system Abortion debate 2003 California recall Act of Parliament Plame affair Computer virus Cryptography Copyright infringement of software Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Divorce Forum moderator British monarchy History of British nationality law EFTPOS Corporate personhood Copyleft Estoppel Article One of the United States Constitution Government of France Article Five of the United States Constitution Congress of the United States United States House of Representatives Corporate governance Legal tender Annuity Trust (Law) USA SmartRider Playing card Theory of conduct Constitution of Ireland West Bank Property (ownership right) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Software license Consensus decision-making Fractional-reserve banking Easement Yu-Gi-Oh!

filing for bankruptcy are you glad you did it my husband and i have had really bad luck with jobs these past couple of years we have racked up some credit card debts and it's hard to make the minimum payments nevermind trying to pay down the balance we somehow make it by each month but pay a lot of our bills late even though we both work full time jobs and i do a home consultant business on the side it's hard to come up with extra money to pay down debts we are thinking of filing bankruptcy as a last resort because we were going to try and refinance our mortgage and take cash out to pay off some bills but with the housing market the way it is we can't get a good appraised value for our house so anyone out there filed bankruptcy and are you glad you did it did all the debts go away or did you have to repay and how long before your credit was back intact yes my husband and i are years out of our bankruptcy and where we do get some credit the apr on all of them are around which is a lot of extra money that we are paying now because of what we did then if i knew then what i know now i would of never filled we even got questioned when we wanted to rent a new apt and they pulled a credit report we have to explain why we filled every time we want to apply for anything it is really hard now and quite embarrassing now i cannot tell you how things would of went had we not filled but at the time it was a quick fix and it did work we got rid of all of our debt i still would never do it again or recommend it to anyone only you know your situation and i would advise talking to a lawyer before you file just to know your options i would maybe even look into a financial advisor to maybe find out some other options on how to get your debt paid off good luck it is a tough decision  Mortgage Deflation (economics) Student loan Bond Debt Bank Money Interest Credit card Schabir Shaik Trial Personal finance Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Primerica Financial Services Credit score Poker jargon Mortgage-backed security Corporate finance Article One of the United States Constitution Betting (poker) Enron Corporation Predatory lending Debt consolidation Unemployment Donald Trump United Kingdom corporation tax Insurance Government debt Economy of Russia Plame affair Finance Annuity Refinancing Microeconomics Appeal Mutual fund Tom DeLay Gold standard FairTax Karl Rove Security (finance) Municipal bond Taxation in the United States Government National Mortgage Association Derivative (finance) Marshall Plan Economy of the United States Life insurance Bretton Woods system Internet fraud Pitaten Keynesian economics Bank fraud U.S. public debt Federal National Mortgage Association Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Delta Air Lines Babe Ruth Graduate school Treasury security Arbitrage Inflation Mensal__o scandal EastEnders Real estate bubble Arthur Laffer Money supply Economics Social rule Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Capital accumulation Fiat money Dot-com History of the United States (1918-1945) Commodity markets Futures contract Financial services Social Security debate (United States) Estoppel Economy of Pakistan High-yield debt Timeline of the Enron scandal Bankruptcy in the United States Dave Ramsey Yield curve Hong Kong Monetary Authority Leasing

is this wrong is it really so wrong for a married couple to have seperate bank accounts and go halfers on all the bills those kind of details are between you and your husband it's your marriage therefore your business every marriage is unique because the people in the marriage are unique and therefore their relationship does not need to fit some one else's mold i believe a marriage is between both spouses and god and of course the quality of the relationship also affects children if you have them but ultimately it's a decision for your husband and you when i first married i insisted on separate accounts because of my mom's bad experience with my dad re money for us separate accounts were the result of my mistrust but i needed that space in the beginning in order to feel safe after a year or so of marriage i decided i was ready to combine everything and he was too now my husband and i share all accounts and are completely open about all our money we like it this way because we feel more unified for us separate accounts felt like we were keeping ourselves separate from each other in a way that's our personal decision and that is what works for us you don't have to do things the way other people are doing them i think you should do whatever strengthens your marriage and works best for you as a couple if your hearts are not separated by keeping separate accounts and if you are managing your money well this way perhaps it gives you the space you feel you both need to function well then who cares what anyone else says you can't please everyone so please your spouse i think separate accounts are a problem primarily if they are used as secret keepers to hide irresponsible spending which will likely lead to debt and ultimately be a destructive force in your marriage you know yourselves what is the root of the separate accounts is it hiding a deeper issue or is this simply the best solution for how the two of you work  Divorce Polyamory Fathers' rights Same-sex marriage One Tree Hill (TV series) Infantilism Polygamy W.I.T.C.H.

should i max out my k and decrease payments my line of credit last year i only put into my k what my employer would match the rest went to debt but if my retirement funds are tax free i'm putting in pre tax money more than i can put into debt which is post tax dollars at year's end is the the savings greater than the on my line of credit i can put away k into my retirment plan i have k in debt is there a ratio of how much should go into each area i'm sorry but the information you have gotten so far here is really innacurate i can break down the numbers for you and make it very simple numbers are simple and they don't lie couple of things first of all i am a mortgage planner with chase though i am well trained i am not a financial planner or a cpa so please double check with a licensed expert to verify what i say here feel free to call me at so i can get more information and deliver an actual proposal to you or visit caseycasperson com or email me at casey x casperson chase com based off of what you have given here you have in debt at you mentioned that it's a line of credit so i'm going to assume that it's a home equity line of credit if this is the case you more than likely get a tax benefit from the interest you pay on it the interest payments on this line come out to be a year but if you're in a tax bracket based off of what you mentioned above you'll actuall get of that back which means your effective rate of interest is though the real estate market has been a roller coaster recently the average home increases by in value every year which means that your home is outracing the effective interest rate that you are paying on your house if you live in a house it should grow on average by by next year and the following while you only paid on that line of credit these facts alone are a good reason not to payoff your line of credit but let's play with some numbers here so we can see if the previous answers are right when it comes to paying debt before saving money you said that you have a year to put into retirement as you mentioned this is higher than what you could use to pay down debt if it's okay with you most people see about taken out of their checks so i'm going to use a more conservative number if you use the to pay down debt it has to be taxed first you now have a year to pay down your credit line assuming that you are making your minimum payment already we'll apply the full toward principal it would take years to pay the account in full you would pay in interest but would get back on taxes unfortunately you will have paid in income taxes on the money you used to payoff your loan so your total out of pocket expense would be about you would free up about a month that you were paying over the year period to begin applying towards your k now what if you took that a year before you taxing it and invested in your k and continued to make the minimum payment on your line of credit over the year period first of all you'd have invested in your k in years the average k creates annually so in five years your with interest would be you would have paid in interest on your heloc but after taxes it would have been your total cost would be here's what we have so far at the end of five years you have in a k growing at but still owe at on the other hand you could have in your k but owe in debt let's look at what happens five years after this in your first scenario you just freed up a month since you don't have to pay on that loan anymore let's say you apply all of that to your k that's you can begin to contribute to your k in years that balance with interest would be total cost would be the you paid to get there the second scenario still requires for you to make your minimum payment on your credit line so you can only apply a year for the next years to your k in years you'd pay out and your balance in your k would grow from to your net worth would be once you subtract the you still owe on the credit line compare this scenario with the scenario where you payoff your debt years from now if you paid off your loan you'd have a net worth of vs keeping the loan outstanding and be worth that's a difference why is this possible because you have been reinvesting tax free money for years longer than the other scenario and that prexisting balance of was able to grow at for another years i hope this makes sense you

what's the best way to go about refinancing to pay off debts my ex is signing over his half of the house to me in return i will need to refinance the house to payoff credit card debts that he left me with not to mention a credit line debt the morgage right now is if the credit card debt was incurred while you were married you are on the hook for that debt if if if the credit account was a joint account or if it was a secured card even if your name wasnt on the card to answer your question go to the mortgage holder and tell them what you are doing it sounds like you have some serious equity in the house have them write you a new first mortgage thats does the following pays the old mortgage off pays off and shuts down the line of credit pays off all your credit card debt a home mortgage is always going to be the lowest interest rate of any of the debts you mention so it is smart to roll all that high interest rate debt into your mortgage and then shut down the card accounts so the ex cant get to them to try and back door you into new debt you are thinking along the right track just follow through and you'll be fine edit due to further information were these the days when you could file bankruptcy and simply write off credit card i would agree with the answerer below but the bankruptcy laws have changed recently i say roll the credit card debt into the mortgage because if she is affording the payments the interest accrues at a much lower rate on the mortgage and if she pays the same amount monthly into her mortgage that she was paying on servicing other debt the payment will pay more principal than keeping the accounts separate and thus get her out of debt sooner rather than later  Mortgage Debt Bond Refinancing Credit card Mortgage-backed security Debt consolidation Student loan Interest Taxation in the United States Government National Mortgage Association Deflation (economics) Derivative (finance) Personal finance FairTax U.S. public debt Social Security (United States) Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Primerica Financial Services Economy of Russia Predatory lending Security (finance) Treasury security Life insurance Real estate bubble Annuity Credit score Collateralized debt obligation Money Government debt Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Municipal bond Federal National Mortgage Association High-yield debt Collateralized mortgage obligation Estoppel Bank Islamic banking Gold standard Donald Trump United Kingdom corporation tax Savings and loan association Microeconomics Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Schabir Shaik Trial Insurance Charles Ponzi Citigroup Bankruptcy in the United States Monetary policy Concurrent estate Article One of the United States Constitution Allodial title Economy of Pakistan Financial services Futures contract Bretton Woods system Developing countries' debt Child support Appeal Debt levels and flows Corporate finance Poker jargon Social Security debate (United States) Credit card fraud Blackjack Economy of India Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Cost of capital Credit derivative Intellectual property Bankruptcy Financial audit Hong Kong Monetary Authority Economy of Chile Bank fraud Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Payroll Securitization Credit history Tax cut Capital accumulation Divorce Salary cap British property bubble Debit card George W.

a canvasser came to my door the other day and took my wife's bank details to set up a direct debit i know she shouldn't have given her bank details but i can't really see what anyone can do with an account number and sort code my bank is very secure and asks me loads of security questions for all transactions so just what do people do with these details if you are in the uk it is most likely a legitimate canvasser charities do this all the time and they usually outsource the canvassing to registered companies that are governed by legislation it is quite common the canvassers often get dropped of by a bus and buzz round a whole area in the space of a day they usually have id photo cards and leave a carbon copy of the direct debit mandate and there is always full contact details including address phone no etc and you have the opportunity to cancel the dd at any point even before a st collection it would be rather drastic to cancel your bank account going by the info you gave in your question all that said there is no harm in being careful if all the above mentioned applied when your wife had the canvasser round then it should be fine and can be easily cancelled if required if this was not the case and you have not been left valid contact info then certainly it would be worthwhile taking a few precautions  Credit card Internet fraud Surveillance Password SmartRider EFTPOS Data retention Plame affair CPU cache Automatic teller machine Advance fee fraud Identity theft Phishing Tax Octopus card Medical prescription Wheel of Fortune Copy protection British national identity card Theory of conduct Stopping e-mail abuse Bank United States Postal Service Atari 8-bit family Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Driver's license Extreme Programming Identity document MetroCard Social rule Political campaign Canvassing X86 assembly language Gmail Microeconomics Census Mail fraud Monopoly (game) George W.

what is the difference between how amex cards work as compared to other credit cards i'm fairly new to this what do you think of the starwood preferred guest card specifically if i were to have another credit card that i might have a balance on for over days which card would be my best bet if i wanted a really low apr and wasn't concerned about rewards or alternately if i did want rewards either in cash or miles other is it worth signing up for the rewards program on my amex corporate green card which equates to the the same rewards as a gold card or is the starwood card better advantages disadvantages the basic difference between amex and other credit cards is that amex has no limit but you have to pay it off when the bill comes mastercard and visa have limits but you can carry a balance past month i have no personal experience with the starwood card so i can't comment on it i use the discover card for paying gas cash back a chase visa for grocery pharmacy purchases back and a chase mc for everything else back beware that if you do carry a balance these reward cards have high interest rates so you need to be sure to pay them off every month or the rewards won't come close to making up for the finance charges check out the site below to compare cards being offered now and pick whichever cards work best for you  Credit card Debit card Octopus card Poker jargon Surveillance MasterCard Bank Loyalty program Betting (poker) Blackjack Wal-Mart Life insurance Sears Holdings Corporation The Amazing Race Inflation Money Credit score Arbitrage Predatory lending VISA (credit card) Internet fraud Cheque Gambling Discover Card Payday loan Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Explosive material Automatic teller machine Interest Corporate finance Mutual fund Money supply Electronic commerce Finance FairTax Bank fraud Consensus decision-making Bank of America Student loan Free trade Mortgage Tax Euro Pension Let's Make a Deal United Kingdom corporation tax Drug test Security (finance) Slot machine E-ZPass H-1B visa Redundant array of independent disks Frequent flyer program Smart card Citigroup PE ratio Baccarat The Contender (television series) Short selling MMORPG Craps Personal finance Draw poker Value added tax Derivative (finance) Supermarket Filling station Refinancing Gold standard Deflation (economics) Annuity Economics RFID Affirmative action Financial audit Gross domestic product ATI Technologies Walt Disney World Resort Passport Modern portfolio theory Primerica Financial Services IBM PC compatible Driver's license Hearts (game) 401(k) Target Corporation Immigration to the United States Skype

i am thinking of getting a loan from my k but does it make sense i recently took out a loan from my bank at intrest and got to thinking if it would make sense to borrow the pay off of the loan and pay intrest back to myself my k is preforming at a little over and a k loan goes at a fee so is it really saving making an extra on my k i really don't think a loan from your k is a good idea for this situation i don't know how much you make but i'm guessing that the loan probably won't take more than a few months to pay off although seems like a better deal than that fee doesn't help you for a loan that's so small that fee is equivalent to adding several percent to your rate because of that the rates are a lot closer than they seem taking money out of your k means it won't be accumulating any earnings until you put the money back not only are you missing out on the earnings you're having to pay back your k with after tax money you're not earning an extra because you're paying with your own money earnings are the money that your investments make not the extra money you invest if you want to put more money into your k you should increase the amount deducted from your pay that way it will be pre tax money going in not the after tax money you'd be putting in from the loan payments those after tax loan payments would again be taxed when you withdraw them in retirement why would you want to be taxed on the money twice the only time i could recommend a k loan is in the case of a medical emergency for which there is no other way to pay in every other situation you are better off leaving the money invested just pay back your bank loan as quickly as possible then do your best to avoid having to take out more loans in the future  Insurance Bond Bank 401(k) Life insurance Social Security (United States) Credit card Money Student loan Annuity Capital accumulation Deflation (economics) Mortgage Inflation Flat tax Hyperinflation Personal finance Mutual fund Supply-side economics Debt Tax Primerica Financial Services Interest United Kingdom corporation tax FairTax Social Security debate (United States) Islamic banking Anarchism and capitalism Capitalism Microcredit Taxation in the United States Economy of Russia Bretton Woods system Microeconomics Variable universal life insurance Bank fraud Warren Buffett Keynesian economics Security (finance) Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Savings and loan association Unemployment benefit Tertiary education fees in Australia Derivative (finance) Gross domestic product Government debt Economy of the United States Advance fee fraud Surplus value Ponzi scheme Short selling Progressive tax Productive and unproductive labour Dividend Federal Reserve Gold standard Cost of capital Income trust Reaganomics Economy of Africa Marshall Plan Money creation Donald Trump Minimum wage Economy of India Deficit spending Investment Islamic economics Micropayment Monetary policy History of the United States (1918-1945) Poker jargon Economy of Pakistan Betting (poker) CPU cache PE ratio Mergers and acquisitions Finance Profit Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Leeds United F.C.

average return on ira what is the average return on an ira account when would lose money on your ira account aside from early withdrawal i'm talking about the market typical inexperienced question ira's do not have an average return an ira is an acronym abbreviation for an individual retirement account it is a type of account like a checking account savings account money market account investment account etc typically the ira account is used as some type of an investment account what makes it an ira versus just calling it an investment account is the exemption from current taxation that the government promises you in return for actually putting money aside for your retirement the government does this because they want people to save for retirement and not be destitute terribly poor when they get too ill weak etc to work any longer so ira's and their special tax exemption like all retirement savings accounts are promises between you and the government i'll save for retirement and government promises to keep their tax collecting hands off until you take it out later or never again if you put money into roth ira okay now you know what an ira is what provides you with a return on your ira is not the type of account it is it is the investment that your money is placed into inside the ira typically banks put your ira money into a cd or money market account this is where most people get confused about ira investment bank employees are not investment educated and do not know what i just explained to you above so many of their customers don't know this either if you openned an ira with an investment firm morgan stanley merrill lynch charles schwab e trade ameritrade etc etc etc then your return would reflect the performance of the investment vehicle you placed your ira money into investment firms can invest your money into a wide range of investment vehicles cd including secondary market ones means one people are selling prior to maturity date that go back on the market and from any bank not just the one you do business with corporate bonds mutual funds annuities individual stocks etc etc that is what determines your risk or lack of if you invested into all cd's there is risk to cd though most people don't know it if the bank was to go bankrupt and they have then the fdic insurance kicks in however it typically takes months to years to get your funds back and without the interest originally offered in the cd fdic does not guarantee your interest only that you will eventually get all your principal back original you put in when would you lose money simple if any of the investments you or your advisor choses not only fails to make you money but either loses money or the cost of buying it is never recovered i e you buy a stock or mutal funds or and it costs you to buy it and all you made was your money back you lost but risk and financial reward in the stock market is not much different than driving to work taking a job eating food from a restaurant you may become ill get in an accident or get fired but should you never leave the house even there your home could have faulty wiring slip on a wet spot in the kitchen etc everything in life is a balance or risk reward the key is to make informed decision with people things places your trust and as all our grandma's said never too many eggs in any one basket sorry so long but a complete answer  Investment bank Hedge fund Variable universal life insurance Capital accumulation Mortgage Citigroup Money supply Pension Monetary policy Short selling Corporation United Kingdom corporation tax Income trust Microeconomics Tax Corporate finance Money Interest Individual Retirement Account Taxation in the United States Economy of Russia Capitalism Retirement plan Finance Institutional fund management Derivative (finance) Credit card Mergers and acquisitions Stock Bank fraud Social Security (United States) Enron Corporation Certificate of deposit Personal finance Deflation (economics) Morgan Stanley Wall Street Individual Savings Account Trust (Law) USA Financial markets Gross domestic product New Deal Warren Buffett Lloyd's of London Microcredit Economy of the United States Stock market Toronto-Dominion Bank Commodity markets Primerica Financial Services Economy of India Internet fraud Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Publicly funded medicine History of the United States (1918-1945) Corporate governance Gold standard Eugene Fama Treasury security Option Ponzi scheme Tesco Yield curve Inflation Privatization Anarchism and capitalism Municipal bond Economics Financial analyst Islamic banking Model (economics) Charles Haughey PE ratio Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Political corruption Risk management Arbitrage Berkshire Hathaway Economy of Pakistan Supply and demand Euro Dot-com Debt

debt settlement i was talking to a friend of mine this morning and he was telling me he was going to do debt settlement even though he still had the ability to pay his bills he said he would get the settlement company to get his balances on credit cards and unsecured debt cut by or more then make a lump sum payment right away and his debt would be cleared with almost no negative effect on his credit he said usually what happens is you take from to years to pay off the amount and in that time it reflects poorly on your credit but as soon as you pay it off it is as if it never happened is this true if so why doesn't everyone do this it sounds like he is a little mis informed or is it true the answers above are both correct depending upon the specific debt settlement company used most debt settlement companies can make a request from the creditor to mark the account as paid as agreed or paid in full either way with a zero balance credit implications in the future are tough to predict he will be late on his accounts and may even wind up with collection accounts if the credit card companies sell the accounts he may even be sued if the debt settlement company has poor relations with the credit card company in his favor will be a drastically decreasing debt to income ratio considering that he will be paying his over all debt down faster than the average consumer hence increasing his fico score and ability to borrow money settlement letters can be seen with both sets of results at http www fdnsolutions com settlementletters and debt settlement is only for consumers in a legitmate financial hardship my guess is that if your friend is able to pay his bills and enrolled in a debt settlement program its probably a case of over promising and later on under delivering have your friend ask for some results from the settlement company so that at least he can see some proof  Credit card Deflation (economics) Credit score Mortgage Bond Life insurance Bretton Woods system Monetary policy Microeconomics Annuity Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 FairTax Government debt Student loan Money Economy of Russia Interest Commodity markets Capital accumulation Inflation Bank Gold standard Money supply Finance Corporate finance Social Security (United States) Estoppel Capitalism Economy of the United States Insurance Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Article One of the United States Constitution Keynesian economics Tax Debt levels and flows Law of value Personal finance Citigroup Supply and demand Futures contract Security (finance) Gross domestic product Mergers and acquisitions U.S. public debt Social Credit 401(k) Derivative (finance) Great Depression Short selling Credit repair Advance fee fraud History of the United States (1918-1945) Legal tender Surplus value Enron Corporation Primerica Financial Services Double-entry book-keeping Supply-side economics Islamic banking Apple Computer Euro Ford Motor Company Business performance management Financial services Divorce Cheque Taxation in the United States United Kingdom corporation tax Tariff Arbitrage Economy of India Deficit spending Electronic commerce Tax cut PE ratio Theory of conduct Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Mutual fund Credit history Price discrimination Economy of Pakistan Animal Crossing Cost of capital Blackjack Baccarat Poker jargon Technocratic movement Contract Consensus decision-making Free trade Economy of Africa

can i buy stuff online with a atm debit card i'm years old i also like online shopping it is possible to purchase things on the net with such a card but you are therefor making it illegal for you to have one so i would suggest asking the owner of the card you would like to use before you do so it is much safer to use a regular credit card on line these cards are not directly linked to the money in ones bank account which is usually necessary to live off of this way if someone somehow gets the card number you can file a claim with the credit card company instead of having your life savings drained  Credit card Debit card Bank Automatic teller machine EFTPOS Credit card fraud Electronic money Bank fraud Personal finance Internet fraud Surveillance Popular, Inc Money Financial services Loyalty program Online shop Octopus card Identity theft Smart card VISA (credit card) Interac Insurance Discover Card Sears Holdings Corporation Electronic commerce Stored-value card Wal-Mart Ulster Bank Monetary policy SmartRider Enron Corporation Neopets Money supply Scrip Bank of America ITunes Music Store Best Buy Citizens Financial Group Expressnet Online gambling Chip and PIN Windows XP Cheque SCO-Linux controversies Oyster card MetroCard Finance America Online Capital accumulation Credit union Legal tender United States Postal Service Gross domestic product Donald Trump Life insurance Steam (content delivery) Irish Life and Permanent Magnet Cruising (maritime) American Express BancNet Economy of Chile Nintendo Filling station Tesco Capitalism Identity document London Underground Beltway sniper attacks Animal Crossing Toronto-Dominion Bank EasyGroup Mergers and acquisitions MTR Commodore 64 Slot machine Bond Contract bridge Nationwide Building Society Equitable PCI Bank Blackjack Aldi Internet Minimum wage Student loan Second Life Argos (retailer) Two-factor authentication Retailer Gambling Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Doomtown Wachovia Frequent flyer program Skype Derivative (finance) Orson Scott Card

as a young person in your 's is it better to start saving for retirement or pay off debt my debt consists of student loans and a mortgage i contribute to a retirement plan with my job but i work for the government so there is no matching for my contributions should i severly reduce the retirement contribution or end it and focus on the debt i think you need a good balanced approach you need to pay off debt as well as increase investments not all debt is bad your mortgage should be the least of your concerns it is good debt as it is backed by an asset that theoretically will increase in value the student loan isn't even that bad because it's probably at a low interest rate you should establish a reasonable goal and time frame for paying it off now that being said i would not put all of my resources into paying off debt it sounds like the right thing to do but in reality saving for retirement is as much about how long you save as it it how much you save being in the market longer allows you more time to generate interest and compound your wealth if you put all of your resources into paying off debt you do lower your liabilities but you lose the opportunity to accumulate wealth as you do it in my opinion it is best to do it balanced if you were deep into credit card debt i may think otherwise but if all you have out there are mortgages and student loans you are really ahead of the game in your 's  Mortgage Debt Personal finance Interest Primerica Financial Services Bond Capital accumulation Credit card Economy of Russia Insurance Capitalism Corporate finance 401(k) Student loan Security (finance) Annuity Inflation Collateralized debt obligation Monetary policy FairTax Keynesian economics Mutual fund Microcredit History of the United States (1918-1945) Bank Bretton Woods system Supply-side economics Government debt Money supply Savings and loan association Mortgage-backed security Finance Social Security (United States) Toronto-Dominion Bank Surplus value Unemployment Social Security debate (United States) Economy of India Debt consolidation Great Depression Federal National Mortgage Association Citigroup Debt levels and flows Hyperinflation Economy of the United States Life insurance Microeconomics Deficit spending Economy of Africa Derivative (finance) Gold standard Financial services Political economy Pension Economy of Pakistan Privatization Refinancing Economy of Chile Economy of El Salvador Intellectual property Donald Trump Taxation in the United States Unemployment benefit Federal Reserve Corporation Liability Subsidy Gross domestic product Tax Reaganomics Mergers and acquisitions Marshall Plan Say's law Education in the People's Republic of China Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Government National Mortgage Association Anarchism and capitalism Economics Income trust Islamic banking Money creation Usury Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Predatory lending Wealth condensation Flat tax Progressive tax Tax cut Wealth Real estate bubble Tertiary education fees in Australia

has anyone heard of using your credit card to take out the money to invest on real estate has anyone tried this method for getting your money to invest in property someone from real estate investing institute suggested this to me but i had never heard of doing it this way would the interest rate be lower than if you go to a bank he said you could just do a transfer balance until you get your profit seems oversimplified and risky to me what do you think i would have to look at the details of the plan but initially this sounds like one of the dumbest things i have ever heard credit cards won't give you a high enough limit to buy real estate credit card interest isn't tax deductible credit card payments and interest rates are much higher than mortgages if you plan on borrowing from your credit card for a down payment on a mortgage don't most mortgage lenders don't like that basically this seems wrong at first glance unless the details somehow overcome all the negatives which i doubt don't do it  Mortgage Insurance Debt Bond Bank Credit card Student loan Deflation (economics) Life insurance Federal National Mortgage Association Taxation in the United States Gross domestic product Donald Trump Annuity Mutual fund Government National Mortgage Association Bank fraud Keynesian economics Islamic banking Inflation Personal finance Microcredit Money Flat tax Predatory lending 401(k) FairTax United Kingdom corporation tax Citigroup Government debt Real estate Economy of Russia Microeconomics Mortgage-backed security Surplus value Dividend Primerica Financial Services Economy of India Argentine Currency Board Financial services Monopoly (game) Monetary policy Supply-side economics Short selling Income trust Economy of the United States Securitization Gold standard Economy of Pakistan Octopus card Reaganomics Tax Interest rate Free trade Capitalism Minimum wage Arthur Laffer Deficit spending Corporation Corporate finance History of the United States (1918-1945) Real estate developer Central bank Business cycle Temasek Holdings Social Security (United States) Public policy Ponzi scheme Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Rational pricing Financial markets Social Security debate (United States) Annual percentage rate Public transport Euro Federal Reserve Internet fraud Debt consolidation Islamic economics Warren Buffett Credit score Investment bank Refinancing Subsidy Great Depression Title insurance Health insurance

how can i find an atm machine that discharges bills i have the need to pull out or so every now and then and every single time i get a bunch of 's no matter where i go or so it seems is there a database online that shows atm machines where you can pull out bills instead of help you won't find a database that will tell you where you can find an atm that does bills most retail locations will only dispenser dollar bills some bank locations will do both 's and 's what you want to find is a gaming establishment like a casino or a strip club these types of locations would be the types to possibly carry bills because they are expecting you to spend lots of money of course the downside to this is that these types of locations will also charge you a higher surcharge i've seen up to in some locations you can check to see if an atm is setup for bill if your fast cash options are limited to multilpes of if your fast cash options are etc then you can be sure that it's going to dispense bills if you're unsure you can try asking the owner or manager who loads the atm unless it's loaded by a third party in this case the manager or owner may not know what it dispenses because they don't pay attention to the atm if you want bills the best bet is to goto your bank and ask for 's instead of going to an atm  Automatic teller machine Slot machine Blackjack Credit card Poker jargon Betting (poker) Money supply Password Bulk vending The Amazing Race Octopus card EFTPOS Gambling Debit card Vending machine Video poker Baccarat Filling station Postage stamp Asynchronous Transfer Mode Wheel of Fortune Bank fraud The Price Is Right Life insurance Euro Draw poker Mutual fund Bank of China (Hong Kong) Monetary policy $ale of the Century United States Postal Service Ulster Bank Let's Make a Deal FairTax Stud poker NCR Corporation United States dollar Internet fraud Security (finance) CPU cache Insurance Citigroup Poker tournament Online poker Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act The Joker's Wild Inflation Popular, Inc Texas hold 'em Broadband Networks CPU design Paintball Internal ballistics Cheque Student loan PE ratio Appeal Firearm Windows XP Caddy Tax Smart card Derivative (finance) Liberty Dollar Overclocking Interest Deflation (economics) Satchel Paige Credit card fraud Trust (Law) USA Roulette Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Airsoft Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Romanian leu Charles Ponzi Taxation in the United States Yield curve Surveillance Game show Hyperinflation MMORPG Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Final Fantasy XI Corporate finance Contract Handloading Traffic contract AmigaOS Expressnet Minor league baseball Gold standard Electronic money Hong Kong dollar System/36 Computer virus

money issues i am currently out of work and my husband is the only one working when he gets paid i call what he earns his money he says that what is mone is your and what is yours is mine but i feel that if i am out of work and havent gotten my disability yet his money isnt mine to spend people tend to disagree with me do you think i am in the right for believeing this he earned it he spends it he is right but i still feel the same as you i still agree with you i know exactly what you mean it's not my money until it is in my hands and if i have to ask for it i'm asking because it is his not mine my ex husband and i had the same discussion over and over again in my case though when i asked for money he would give it to me but then he'd ask what for even if it was to buy something for the house or necessary toilet paper etc i would feel angered and hurt 'does he think i'm gonna blow it on shoes and ice cream ' mostly i felt that he didn't trust me though i knew it was just a simple question it made me feel more miniscule and childlike to have to give explanations still above having to ask for money from him personally it made me feel less and had a giant effect on my self esteem strage how something so insignificant and knowingly wrong could do that i knew it was our money our bills our everything but i couldn't shake that feeling of being looked down on no matter how comfortable he tried to make me i think if it was given to me without expectations or questions like an allowance a gift i would have been better maybe now with my current bf we both work after bills are paid and the necessary has been covered if i have 'spending money' left over i'll just hand him what i want to give him if it is the end of the pay period and he's got left i'll give him another if i have it to spare without a word or hide it in his wallet to give him a good day surprise when he finds it he may ask what's this for to make sure it's not allotted for something i'll say whatever you need and he does the same for me  Plame affair EastEnders Money Theory of conduct Poker jargon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Socrates Inflation FairTax National Kidney Foundation Singapore Contract Keynesian economics Toilet Social rule Schabir Shaik Trial StarCraft: Uprising Sin City One Tree Hill (TV series) Economic inequality 1957 World Series Milton H.

should i consolidate my student loans what are the risks and benefits pros and cons i just graduated with k in student loans and i'm wondering if it's worth it to consolidate or if i should leave my loans as they are my rate is a bit over and my payments which start in december will be about a month i have a friend who is married to a guy in a wheelchair that has always said that she would never consolidate her student loans because if you do your loans aren't forgiven in case of complete disability as her husband's were on the other hand a lower interest rate would be nice what factors should i consider when deciding whether to consolidate if consolidating would be a good choice are there any particular lenders that you would recommend if your student loans have different interest rates then you may want to consider consolidating them once the interest rate has fallen below your lowest interest rate if you owe student loans to more than lender you may want to consider consolidating your loans for the convienience of making monthly payment and saving all the interest you'd pay with multiple loans if you are able bodied your student loans would not be forgiven under any circumstances consolidated or not in any case my husband declared bankruptcy a couple of years before we got married and his student loans were the only debts not forgiven during that process as with any loan if you are considering consolidation do your research carefully there are several student loan companies that do consolidations check with your state's higher education authority there may be a couple of state authorized corporations that deal exclusively with student loans and consolidations these corporations would give you the best interest rates and the best financial terms for repayment in the state of kentucky that corporation is the kentucky higher education student loan corporation they handled the financing of all of my student loans in college and i was able to consolidate at a great rate once i graduated this is leaving me with more money as i am not paying out interest payments on the multiple loans i took out for college every month  Student loan Bond Debt Mortgage Bank Interest Credit card Deflation (economics) Insurance Debt consolidation Monetary policy Finance Subsidy United Kingdom corporation tax Predatory lending Annuity Microeconomics Financial markets Credit score Government National Mortgage Association Gold standard Money 401(k) Life insurance Bankruptcy Divorce Economy of the United States Privatization Tuition History of the United States (1918-1945) Corporation U.S. public debt Donald Trump Municipal bond Savings and loan association Islamic banking Personal finance Federal National Mortgage Association Social Security debate (United States) Hyperinflation Primerica Financial Services Derivative (finance) Bank fraud Taxation in the United States Graduate school Social Security (United States) Tax FairTax Federal Reserve Usury Microcredit Capital accumulation Education in the People's Republic of China Estoppel Unemployment Asian financial crisis Capitalism Lender of last resort Economy of Pakistan Collateralized debt obligation Rational pricing Mergers and acquisitions Health care in the United States Corporate finance Savings and Loan crisis EastEnders Inflation Credit history Deficit spending Great Depression Yield curve Bretton Woods system Tennessee State Constitution Marriage Financial services Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 12 Enron Corporation College admissions Temasek Holdings Education in New Zealand Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Payday loan Mutual fund School of Salamanca Price discrimination Lend-Lease

what is the best way to begin establishing credit i am starting out on my own and i have little to no credit most companies require deposits that are out of this world because i have no credit i need really good advice thanks secured credit cards are one way of beginning to establish a credit history you deposit between and in the account and that is as much as you can charge you should really shop around for the best deal in terms of application fees annual charges and terms and conditions once you have established some credit history this way then you can apply for more conventional credit cards or small personal loans that you are confident you can pay back on time the thing to remember is that a credit card is like taking out small loans to improve a credit score you need to not use much of the credit you have available and also pay back the card on time for your own benefit try to pay off the full amount rather than just the minimum payment as you will pay interest on the amount remaining good luck  Credit card Bank Mortgage Insurance Life insurance Taxation in the United States Annuity Bond Bank fraud Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus United Kingdom corporation tax Credit score Internet fraud Money Octopus card Interest Islamic banking Gold standard Personal finance EFTPOS Health insurance Social Security (United States) Money supply Citigroup Credit union Credit card fraud Mutual fund Betting (poker) Deflation (economics) Primerica Financial Services Taxation in the Republic of Ireland 401(k) Economy of Russia Debit card Credit history Certificate of deposit Predatory lending National Insurance Trade union Bretton Woods system Unemployment benefit Letter of credit Education in the United States Auto insurance Blackjack Tax Micropayment Short selling Trust (Law) USA Monetary policy Marshall Plan Graduate school E-ZPass Schabir Shaik Trial Universal life insurance Surveillance Anarchism and capitalism Cheque Minimum wage Poker jargon Debt Food Stamp Program Government debt Baccarat Gross domestic product Margin (finance) Leasing American Express Education in the People's Republic of China Fractional-reserve banking Mutualism (economic theory) Donald Trump Savings and loan association Financial services Identity theft Finance Government National Mortgage Association Scrip Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 12 Mahjong Bank of America Immigration to the United States Skype Dividend Neopets Security (finance) Corporation Automatic teller machine Intellectual property Derivative (finance) Copyright Hyperinflation Corporate finance Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Mao (game) Public good Education in Germany

ebay question about listing hello does anyone know how to list a 'pick up only' item on ebay i've looked on the site and can't find how to do it when listing something up i'd like it to look like this postage costs pick up only see item description for details post to will arrange for local pick up only no postage but instead it looks like the only choice is to put postage as 'free' which is misleading can anyone help thank you thanks everyone i went back to edit it and the option came up it didn't come up the first time which is strange but anyway all sorted now there has always been an option to choose local pick up only on every listing that i've ever done if you don't find that as one of your choices just choose other and list that it's available for local pick up only it's not a bad idea to list it in the description of the items too just so there's no confusion about it later best of luck to you  Postage stamp United States Postal Service Neopets Monty Hall problem MapleStory Wheel of Fortune Gaia Online Live 8 Animal Crossing Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Poker jargon The Apprentice 2 Quicksort Internet fraud Post office Legal research RuneScape Random Events Sheepshead Winning Streak Chrono Trigger Dodge Charger Axiom of choice RuneScape Let's Make a Deal Online auction business model Topps Press Your Luck Paul W.

paying off a student loan i am graduating shortly and i am wondering about the process of paying off a k loan i would assume i am getting a decent job after graduation and will be able to afford to pay between a month towards it without getting into fianancial trouble i am a bit knowledgable about finances and whatnot so feel free to give me more advanced recommendations here are my main issues should i pay off k quickly or slowly i don't want the interest to accumulate to k over years should i consolidate my loans during the grace period into a low interest one or should i hold off since once i consolidate my rate will be locked down if i get a signing bonus of hypothetically k should i invest it or pay off the student loan the investments might have higher interest than the loan making it more worthwhile to save instead of pay any other recommendations would be appreciated thanks once you can afford to make payments consolidate your student loans to lock into a low inetrest rate as it is now your interest rate is probnably variable and will only go up when you consolidate pick a monthly payment amount you're comfortable with maybe not as high as you anticipate you can afford that way if you have a tight month you can make the lower payment if you get a sign on bonus investigate what interest rates are out there for you as far as investing it you may want to think about talking to a certified financial planner about what would be the best way to go with the money  Student loan Annuity Credit card Life insurance Monetary policy Mortgage Insurance Economy of Russia Interest Debt Bond Deflation (economics) Mutual fund Education in the People's Republic of China Bank Personal finance Derivative (finance) Social Security (United States) Keynesian economics United Kingdom corporation tax 401(k) Euro Microeconomics Federal Reserve Capital accumulation Money Government National Mortgage Association Municipal bond Hyperinflation Unemployment Free trade Anarchism and capitalism Savings and loan association Islamic banking Government debt Graduate school Variable universal life insurance Credit score Capitalism Labor theory of value Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Progressive tax Investment bank Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia FairTax Price discrimination Collateralized debt obligation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social Security debate (United States) Flat tax MMORPG Education in the United States Schabir Shaik Trial Gross domestic product PE ratio Microcredit Charles Ponzi Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Economy of the United States Minimum wage Interest rate History of the United States (1918-1945) Security (finance) Public transport Israeli Arab Marshall Plan Hillary Rodham Clinton Debt consolidation Say's law Federal National Mortgage Association Gold standard Usury Present value Short selling Unemployment benefit Top-up fees Publicly funded medicine Deficit spending Economy of Chile Wealth condensation Salary cap Economy of India Economy of Pakistan Stock Monetary and fiscal policy of Japan Tertiary education fees in Australia Reaganomics Mensal__o scandal Modern portfolio theory

finance question family of four soon to be five is this a sound plan we make a year in iowa we pay on our car loan a month still owe a month on a tsp loan still owe on a separate tsp loan we still owe and about a month to the army on a debt husband was deployed daughter got sick he had to come home and ran out of leave time and kept being paid with the knowledge we would pay back and i have absolutely no idea what we still owe they keep heaping fines on top of it as they dont feel we are paying it back quick enough goes into a retirement account every month into another retirement account every month we pay on our credit cards every month under total we also pay a month ins and a month for life ins we have about a dollar bill for phone cell and internet house is electric gas water we also took out a loan to pay part of our hvac system we have a closing cost refund of about coming in a few weeks and one of our tsp loans will be paid off in weeks with the i planned to pay off of the credit cards the other thousand wont accrue interest for another mo then pay off the hvac loan next in december i would take out a new tsp loan i have to wait days after the other is paid off at a low rate of something depending on the daily market i would take out and pay off everything except the army and use any left over for new beds for all kids and my husband and i if nothing is left over we will wait till tax time last year we got back about something all together then i would make the payments i would otherwise be making towards everything to the house loan to get it paid down quicker half and half into savings as buying the house depleted our savings to zilch we put down we still owe as in the last couple months about has went to capital we are on a fixed rate of and i am paying what i can extra then when taxes come back hopefully we can use them to buy a better vehicle as our mercury villager has seen better days am i crazy what would you suggest our bring home after everything is about a every two weeks sounds like a plan but instead of putting extra toward the house i would first replinish the savings account for emergency funds no sense in putting all of your extra money onto the house to save which isn't really what you are saving see more below and then having an emergency appliance failure car repair etc and having to take out a high interest loan to pay for that which sounds like is what happened when you had to replace the hvac after you get about months of income into the savings account invest the rest maybe start a college fund for each of the kids or add additional to your retirement fund the house is at a low interest rate which ends up being an even lower rate once you consider the tax deduction on the interest it reallly makes no sense to pay off a mortgage early unless you have an outrageous subprime interest rate after you consider the tax deduction your interest rate is really only about you can put your money in a savings account ing direct is currently almost i have several money markets that are and cd's right now can be over so don't earn on it by paying additional on the mortgage when you can and invest it and earn or more also in case you need emergency funds you don't want it tied up into the house where you don't have easy access to the equity by keeping the mortgage you are essentially using their money to make money for you and that is how one becomes rich in this country people don't get rich in this country because of their salary and people don't get rich by scraping pennies and shopping at walmart they get rich by investing wisely and there is nothing wiser than using someone else's money to make money for you  Taxation in the United States Credit card United Kingdom corporation tax Personal

optional liability damage waivers my boyfriend and me are currently renting a lap top from colortyme and we have been paying for the optional liability damage waiver well in june our home was broken into and the crooks stole my laptop and we are still being held responsible for it what i would like to know is what does the waiver cover i am so confused because the manager has lied to me about what i have been responsible for before we put a deposit on a tv but then changed our minds and called to tell him the next morning and he said he would not refund our deposit but then i called the corporate office on him and he was told to give it back to us so i'm not sure if he is just trying to get the money or if we are still responsible if we are then i want to know what the purpose of having the waiver and paying for it was for please help me if i find that i should not be responsible i will take as much legal action against him or the company as do you have a copy of your rental contract and the damage waiver read thru it very carefully it is entirely possible that theft is not included in the damage waiver or there might be certain requirements such as a police report to file a claim damage waivers are very profitable for the rental company they typically have lots of loopholes you probably could have purchased renter's insurance that covered all your belings for a little more than what you paid for the waiver  Insurance Auto insurance Estoppel Taxation in the United States Life insurance Plame affair Rental agreement Annuity Lloyd's of London Corporation Public domain Tax Credit card Security (finance) Tort reform Medical malpractice Wal-Mart Intellectual property United Kingdom corporation tax Leasing United States Postal Service Poker jargon Blockbuster Video SCO-Linux controversies Business ethics Microeconomics Bank First-sale doctrine Renting Price discrimination Babylonian law Rental car Karl Rove Xerox Copyright infringement of software Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Islamic banking Enron Corporation Stock Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Internet fraud Warez Creative accounting Church of Scientology Bond Warranty Scientology beliefs and practices Octopus card Corporate finance Bank fraud SCO v.

what did you do to achieve your goals i would like to ask a question to all people who have their own place plenty of money a car especially the car lol most of all freedom i'm years old i always feel like i'm struggling to make ends meet although i have two wonderful jobs that both offers excellent wages hours it just doesn't feel like it's enough without sounding too pitiful a few of my most desired goals in the whole world is to finally escape from my family find a place of my own to stay preferably in a new town where i can begin a new life for myself i also desire lots of money new friends a car freedom but it all costs a lot of money unfortunately i am still teaching myself about financial matters as my parents stupidly never taught me about the responsibilities of money as a child now i'm paying for their mistake have you ever felt like you were trapped helpless then one day you finally succeeded in breaking free if so what did you do because i need help highland i think you bought up a great question most of our parents and most if not all of our schools do not teach us the essentials of finance they just give us chores or assignments to do that does not even deal with real life i was in your exact same position when i was around your age it all changed one day that day was when i discovered a book title think and grow rich i read it ferverously and i started to take action taking action is the first step to breaking free it is the cornerstone of my success and failures most people read books and they may know how a deal works but they never took action i use to do that i was on the sidelines for the most part of my life until i decided to take action the next step is abc if you have seen glengarry glen ross you know what i mean abc is always be closing that is the mindset you need to have in order to be successful in business you have to treat every financial negogiation or deal like it is your last the last step is your willingness to learn learn everything from the stock market to real estate i remember when i use to hate real estate it felt like everyone was in it and i didn't want to be like everyone else it all changed when i found how lucrative it can be by investing in abandoned code violated and condemned properties the rest was history all i can say is that you have to find what you truly love is it really the money recognition or new friends that you need you need to reevaluate your life i think that everyone aorund your age feels the exact same way is this it is this what life is you must ask yourself the very basic questions before you can delve into all of the stuff i said above charlie ps carpe diem  Microeconomics Warren Buffett EastEnders Pitaten Keynesian economics The Apprentice 2 Insurance Education in the People's Republic of China Avenue Q Economic inequality Supply and demand Extreme Programming Days of our Lives Free trade Personal finance Theory of conduct Economics Ten Commandments Blackjack Volleyball New Deal The Amber Spyglass W.I.T.C.H.

mortgage lending problem i don't fully understand the mortgage lending problem going on can someone explain it to me or send me a link explaining it bank and other lending was very loose especially since mortgages were being underwritten and packaged by wall street and big banks and sold as securities to investors these securities were very attractive because the yields for other fixed income investments were low investor money was chasing higher risk for marginally higher premiums in order to keep originating new mortgages to feed these securitizations mortgage lenders kept creating looser and looser structures hybrids negative amortization teaser adjustable rates interest only and lending to less creditworthy borrowers for the borrowers money was easy to come by as home values continued increasing everywhere justifying sometimes outrageous loans so home prices cooled people were left having to hold their homes and pay their mortgages but many couldn't afford them as asjustable rates were adjusting higher or people just overstepped their limits as defaults started rising from the mortgages originated in people started to realize that there was going to be a fallout investors in those mortgage backed securities were nervous and realizing that alot of those securities might be worth less than originally thought prices of the securities declined in the markets some funds went out of business then mortgage originators who were lending subprime were facing margin calls as fewer banks were lending to them to underwrite these loans which were no longer popular to the investors some of these companies went bankrupt now they are feeling it in the stock markets too so some debt laden borrowers are losing their homes some financial institutions have gone out of business and some investors are losing money and housing doesn't seem to be picking up again  Federal National Mortgage Association Mutual fund Security (finance) Insurance Financial markets Mortgage-backed security Finance Bretton Woods system Deflation (economics) Investment bank Annuity Short selling Government National Mortgage Association Monetary policy Derivative (finance) Yield curve Life insurance Securitization Asian financial crisis Government debt Microeconomics Islamic banking Financial services Savings and loan association Capital accumulation Interest rate Stock Credit card Donald Trump Privatization Stock market FairTax Toronto-Dominion Bank Student loan Income trust Real estate bubble Microcredit Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation History of the United States (1918-1945) Gold standard Money Great Depression Hedge fund Margin (finance) Islamic economics Usury Supply-side economics Free trade Cost of capital Money supply Arbitrage Temasek Holdings Developing countries' debt Mergers and acquisitions Lehman Brothers Enron Corporation Berkshire Hathaway Federal Reserve Hyperinflation Central bank Fixed income Wall Street Crash of 1929 Lloyd's of London Economy of Pakistan Economic relations of Japan Michael Milken Primerica Financial Services Social Security debate (United States) Corporation Money market Gold as an investment Futures contract Wells Fargo Warren Buffett Capitalism Economy of Argentina Municipal bond Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Surplus value PE ratio Annual percentage rate Day trading Bank fraud History of post-Soviet Russia Hong Kong Monetary Authority Taxation in the United States

what action can be taken to alert people that there are scammers who ask women to cash chase travelers checks there are people on yahoo personals and i happen to chat with one and they get you in their confidences and later ask you for a favor because they are starting a new business in your state then they offer to give you money for cashing checks and the checks are bogus this is being done from benin possibly and they prey on women who want to help others the people online are actually college students and not aware of what damage they are doing to people as they have to cover these bogus checks they have cashed at their banks maybe all bank tellers need a short course on identifying these famliliar looking travelers checks maybe the law enforcement should have some safety tips posted on line about making money transactions even on dating sites a list of questions needs to be made on the yahoo personals site and any other site where women and men meet this is more common than you think the cashing of these bogus checks ok bank tellers are given extensive training on how to identify counterfit checks and travelers checks and cash the problem is that the fakes are so good now that it is hard to know if something is fake or not to compound matters the public expects tellers to be able to spot and stop fake checks on the spot and that is just not the case if people would stop doing stupid things like washing their money and paychecks it would be easier to tell the differance between counterfit and just worn also i am not sure if you are personally aware but there are about companies that provide banks with travelers checks so it is not possible to know the security features for all checks it is just not as for the other part of this statment anyone who is offered a money in exchange for cashing money should know it is a scam or at least illegal it the travelers checks are not fake then this is till money laundering money for nothing unsolicited is the biggest scam out there right now i feel the public has been well informed but i still get customers a shift who won the lottery and when you tell them they have been scamed they get mad when you put a hold on the check that doesn't even cover the time it takes for the check to come back fake because the government doesn't allow for more than days and it takes the average fake check days to come back the customers are livid so i think the burden falls on the public to be aware that money for nothing scams are not legit stay back and don't bite  Internet fraud Advance fee fraud Bank fraud Confidence trick Surveillance RuneScape cheats Automatic teller machine Credit card Bank Phishing Social rule Enron Corporation Charles Ponzi Bank of China (Hong Kong) Spam (electronic) MapleStory Contract Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Poker jargon Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus FairTax E-mail Money laundering Short selling Cheque The Amazing Race Life insurance Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Mail-order bride Citigroup Microeconomics Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation United States Postal Service Mail fraud Mutual fund Theory of conduct Electronic money Monetary policy Password Security (finance) EFTPOS Betting (poker) Pyramid scheme Craps Deflation (economics) Money supply Insurance Neopets Hyperinflation Finance Gambling Debit card Sin City Futurama (TV series - season 3) Investment bank Ocean's Twelve Keynesian economics Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Inflation Financial audit Google Paintball Legal research Slot machine Lawyer Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina E-mail spam Identity theft Fiat money Financial markets Pok__mon Chronicles Anonymity Tax British House of Commons Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Arbitrage Jeff Gannon Ice hockey Gold standard Tom DeLay Katelyn Faber Octopus card Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Young Ones (TV series) Parachuting Enterprise content management The Price Is Right Blog Mad Money Medical prescription Notary public

would you do this for the financial benefits this is a serious question my hubby has been offered a high paying job which is hours drive away from where we and our families live and in an isolated community in the desert there are quite a lot of people living there and i would be able to make friends with the other stay home mums there the thing is i am getting cold feet about it i am not going to have time off from my daughter hubby and i wont be able to go to the movies anymore there is no cinema and the main local event is watching footy games and i can't stand football if we stay in our home his pay will be a year less and we will have to support our entire a month mortgage repayments whereas is we move we earn more money and have a renter in our house and we get subsidised rent for a week financially i know it's the right thing to do but i am scared of being so far from the city even though the contract is only years would you go there are no easy answers to your opportunity however can i suggest that you both think about what you will do after the year contract expires will you be in a financial position to do what you really want will there be other opportunities open to you which just won't appear if you don't move i know its corny but there is a saying you don't know what you don't know and the only way to find out is by doing something different the key is to have a longer term plan something you are both striving for which will get you through the tough times that way you can both stay the distance then move on to something better after the two years one final thought it may be a bit painful making as much money as you can as quickly as you can but it will make the rest of your life a lot easier in summary think long term be prepared for some short term pain to get the longer term gain but always ensure that you both share a common goal and are prepared to support each other through the tough times in achieving it  FairTax Social rule Insurance EastEnders Student loan Contract Life insurance Leasing Chess strategy and tactics Leeds United F.C.

help have to make okay look i know i keep asking but i need to make i have to buy back to school clothes and my mom will not give me money i'm somehow i think that if you actually needed the clothes your mom would be more then willing to buy them for you what i see happening here is the beginning of some really poor spending habits it starts out slow then blooms into some serious debt but you do want some new clothes for school good i support that here's what you need to do it will impress your mom and get you well on the way to a secure financial future drop the requirement for worth of clothes no one really believes that it is a true need of the worth of clothes that you want select a few items that would make the most difference keep the amount you need below preferably below approach your mom your neighbors your aunts uncles etc ask for jobs that will pay some money get for washing a car for mowing a lawn etc when you have earned enough to pay for the clothes that you have selected and a few dollars more do these two things first ask your mom or dad to drive you to their bank so that you can open up an account put the money you earned over and above in the account ex if you needed but earned put the extra in the bank second ask your mom to drive you to the store so that you can buy your own special clothes for school now i can't guarantee anything but most parents are very proud and impressed when their children do things in a mature and responsible manner i would not be surprised if you mom decided to pay for some of your clothes herself if she does put the rest of the money in the bank right away by doing that you have learned two very valuable lessons one is that money costs you parents do not get money for doing nothing they work for it how many hours do you think your parents have to be at work for that second you have learned that every time you earn some money there are rewards for putting some of it away right away that money in the bank will earn interest and grow over time if you continue to put money in or at a time when you are you will have enough to make a down payment on a house or buy a new car without having to finance it best of luck  Bond Money Insurance Islamic banking Capital accumulation Money supply Credit card Great Depression Microeconomics Inflation Monetary policy FairTax Bank Debt Life insurance Gold standard Deflation (economics) Student loan Poker jargon Stock Wheel of Fortune MMORPG Hyperinflation Social Security (United States) Commodity markets Capitalism Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) U.S. public debt Bretton Woods system Mortgage Estoppel Government debt Internet fraud Divorce The Amazing Race Annuity Electronic commerce Small business Social Credit Interest Gross domestic product Arbitrage Mutual fund American individualist anarchism Short selling Opportunity cost Tax Asian financial crisis Corporate finance Married... with Children Child support United States dollar Wealth Corporation Economic inequality Taxation in the United States Federal Reserve Economy of Russia Health insurance Graduate school Social Security debate (United States) Education in the United States National Kidney Foundation Singapore Marshall Plan Education in the People's Republic of China Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Anarchism and capitalism Sears Holdings Corporation The Adventures of Pete & Pete Monopoly (game) Enron Corporation Donald Trump About a Boy Finance Ocean's Twelve Investment bank Japanese tea ceremony Warren Buffett Craps Yield curve Clothing Pound sterling CPU cache Knots Landing Financial markets Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 401(k) Financial services PE ratio Campaign finance reform Flat tax Betting (poker)

what can i do to make money to pay my rent being unemployed i'm unemployed and really pressed for money to pay my rent which is already past due what can i do to make up the difference i've tried asking family and organizations but i don't qualify or either the family can't assist me i don't know what else to do i was a victim of katrina and i've tried the catholic charaties but to no avail hi i my heart goes out to you i would suggest that you speak to your landlord and explain your situation perhaps your landlord will be willing to work something out with you to pay the remaining balance of your rent also your landlord would probally rather you be open and forward about not having the total amount at this time and more likely to help you out in the long run you may be avoiding other possible issues such as eviction tarnishing your credit and even a lawsuit i don't have an answer pertaining to what you can do to get the extra money but i hope that what i've posted is of some help and can at least buy you some time until you can get the money take care and good luck scott  Leasehold estate Eviction Economics Capitalism Unemployment Estoppel Anarchism and capitalism Great Depression Inflation Insurance Health insurance Labor theory of value Monopoly (game) Microeconomics Harlem Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Taxation in the United States Gross domestic product Public policy Unemployment benefit Betting (poker) Poker jargon Mutual fund Money Deflation (economics) Say's law Bretton Woods system Press Your Luck Abortion debate Babylonian law Capital accumulation CPU cache Surplus value Leasing Wal-Mart Unreformed House of Commons Karl Rove Marshall Plan Barack Obama Prostitution in Germany Famine American individualist anarchism Economy of the United States Walter Scott Surveillance New Deal Debt Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Student loan Michael D.

wage garnishment release question i had a judgement against me for a past debt i missed a payment and my employer received an order to garnish my wages i paid the debt before the garnishment was to start and the collections firm is faxing me a release of the garnishment as well as filing it with the court i work in missouri my question is what should my employer do i share an office with our payroll person and she is not sure adp does our actual payroll everything i've read says that the employer should pretty much be off the hook once the release is filed but since the garnishment never started i'm just not sure i don't want my employer to get in trouble over my financial problems i would really like if someone in this field i e paralegal at a collections firm a payroll person who has done garnishments would answer my question my employer has not started the garnishment do they still need to start it do they need to file anything with the circuit court i work for a very small company we don't often have this kind of situation your employer does not have to start that garnishment there is no trouble they will get into if they don't i mean at the most what are talking about here a couple of weeks before the garnishment release gets to them advising them to stop anyway remember when the collections firm sends the release to the court the court will then send a release to your employer what the firm is faxing to you is a copy of the release for this precise reason so you can prove you paid it to your employer the only way an employer would ever have any consequences of not obeying an order for garnishment is if there was a serious delay in starting it such as several months or if the employer refused to do it as many employers do in that case there would be non compliance papers filed with the court by the collections firm and your employer could be fined nominally however the only reason your employer would ever end up dealing with such consequences is if the collections firm pursued it the court could not care less if the debt is paid their job is merely to provide the tools to legally collect it believe me the court is not following up on your case or any other case for that matter the garnishment could sit dormant for two years with no funds being paid at all and the court would never even notice it would only be when the court was notified by the collections firm that the employer wasn't cooperating that anything would ever result from a garnishment not being done so if the collections firm has been paid by you already obviously they're not interested in pursuing that garnishment so you can tell your payroll person all of this and if she still needs something on paper to prove she is safe to not begin garnishing you just give her a copy of the release they are faxing to you if for some reason she felt compelled to still comply with the garnishment until she got the mailed release you would be refunded anything extra you paid laws vary from state to state but i'm pretty sure that mo law is not that different from ours here in oh  Child support Taxation in the United States Social Security (United States) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Tax Microeconomics Tax protester Appeal Paralegal Public domain Divorce FairTax Minimum wage Credit card Lawyer Wal-Mart Theory of conduct Trade union Article One of the United States Constitution Corporate governance Enron Corporation Annuity Payroll United Kingdom corporation tax Copyright Contract Same-sex marriage in Canada Unemployment Schabir Shaik Trial Economy of Russia Government of Maryland Legal aspects of transsexualism GNU General Public License Law firm 401(k) Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Password Bank fraud Advance fee fraud W.

what is the worst case scenario if i file for bankruptcy how long will it take to stop becoming a pariah how long does it take to get your credit score up i knoiw it stays for years but how does it affect your score the absolute worst case credit wise would be a credit score of the absolute lowest possible score and you still owing on student loans which cannot be wiped out by bankruptcy it will result in not being able to obtain an apartment or any credit and possibly getting rejected for jobs especially if they are gov't or finance jobs it usually takes about a year and a half for your score to start to increase again but you will start to receive preapproved credit offers again about mo after your bankruptcy is discharged i'd recommend building new credit as soon as possible which will help you to build credit faster go to your credit union and get a secured credit card and a secured loan remember you cannot build a high credit score if you don't have any current credit bankruptcy stays on your credit report for yrs depending on whether it is chapter or chapter bankruptcy after a few years you will eventually be able to qualify for credit just at higher rates or possibly needing a cosigner  Student loan Graduate school Credit score Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Credit card Debt Social Security (United States) Deflation (economics) Mortgage Taxation in the United States Bankruptcy in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Appeal Bank Debt consolidation FairTax Grade (education) Economy of India Interest Education in the United States Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina United Airlines Leeds United F.C.

who's responsible for the debt in case of divorce my hubby and i live in texas i understand that this is a common property state and that we are jointly responsible for any debts we incur no matter who racks it up however if we move to a separate property state arkansas for instance in a couple of years would the responsibility for debts still be shared equally the issue of debt in a divorce case is rather tricky it really does not matter if you are in a community property state or not first even if the divorce decree states that each individual is responsible for half of all debts or the all debts incurred during the marriage will be the responsiblity of the a single person financial companies have the right to go after all individuals that were party to the loan for example if a credit card was issued to your husband and you have an a card on his account he will be responsible for the entire debt if both of you have a joint credit card account card was issued based upon both of your incomes if one party fails to pay the debt then the other party on the card will be pursued to pay the entire outstanding debt payments a home mortgage is the same once a divorce occurs the mortgage company has the right not to release a party to mortgage loan if their income was required for the person to qualify for the loan the mortgage company would have more risk exposure if it was otherwise auto loans are the same if both individuals income was required for the loan or the person that received the auto does not sufficent income to have qualified for the loan on their own when it comes to irs debt if they filed married joint returns during the years of marriage both parties are responsible for any outstanding tax debt for the related years even if one party did not work  Mortgage Insurance Concurrent estate Taxation in the United States Debt Divorce Money Credit card Bond 401(k) Personal finance Marriage United Kingdom corporation tax Mortgage-backed security Life insurance Student loan Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 FairTax Security (finance) Government debt Islamic banking Deflation (economics) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Child support Predatory lending Tax Municipal bond Derivative (finance) Donald Trump Annuity Economy of Russia Social Security (United States) Flat tax Interest Tax protester Economy of the United States Debt consolidation Debt levels and flows Monetary policy U.S. public debt Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Bankruptcy in the United States Federal National Mortgage Association Real estate bubble Allodial title Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Bank fraud Primerica Financial Services Corporate finance Finance Legal tender Financial markets Auto insurance Gold standard Polyamory Great Depression Mergers and acquisitions Corporation Canadian Senate ACORN Article One of the United States Constitution Government National Mortgage Association Unemployment benefit Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Capitalism Mutual fund Variable universal life insurance Income tax Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Same-sex marriage in Canada Microcredit Savings and loan association Title insurance Credit derivative Collateralized debt obligation Financial services Babylonian law Treasury security Microeconomics Political subdivisions of New York State Consensus decision-making National Insurance School of Salamanca Hillary Rodham Clinton Fungibility Anarchist economics Rights and responsibilities of marriages in the United States Real estate broker Bank of China (Hong Kong) Credit card fraud Citigroup Civil union Economy of India Anarchism and capitalism

anyone still going ahead with bank charges claiming back your bank charges after the banks went to the oft yes its still worth claiming your charges back in the case that the oft win its also very important that you do it now if you want to the reason for this is that you can claim back years currently under the statuate of limitiations if you wait until the results of the test case and then appeals etc which could be up to years away then you could only claim back to august however if you just send a single letter asking for charges back by recorded delivery to the bank now it will lock the date of you claim so no matter how long it takes for the test case to resolve you will still be able to claim back to august and won't lose years worth of charges which could be claimed if the worst comes to the worst and the banks win all you ve lost is the cost of stamp so its definately worthwhile doing it also means that if the oft win as you're claim is already in the system your claim will be dealt with quicker although i would normally advise people to get a total of their charges first and then write to the bank asking for your charges back because of the time this takes days i would do it the other way round first write to the bank asking for your charges back putting no figure in the letter and then you can write to the bank asking for your charges or copies of your statements for the last years which they still have to provide for more advice template letters and step by step guides have a look at my web site below the site is free to use  Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act United States Postal Service Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Mail SCO-Linux controversies Password Web crawler Gettysburg Address Internet fraud Domain Name System Open access Poker jargon Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Baccarat Hyperinflation Alex Ferguson Appeal Postage stamp Financial audit CPU design Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.

does anyone know what liability financial corporations have when posting cheques to you if a cheque is never received does the financial institution that allegedly posted it have any sort of responsibility duty of care to ensure that it is safeguarded if posting a cheque is not a secure method then why would they do this if anyone can point me in the direction of any sort of legal stuff on this would be most appreciated thanks thanks the cheque has been cashed not by me is high value k and the police are not interested in the least as they don't believe a crime has been committed because the institution that posted it are not filing the complaint mad isn't it am not sure where to turn next i'm an american we inherited most of our laws in this area from britian since drafts on banks and trade houses pre date the founding over here the safeguard is on the cashing end not the posting mailing of the cheque the bank or firm that takes a checue in guarantees to the maker of the cheque that they did cash it for the correct person so what happens when a cheque is lost in the post or stolen out of the post is that the person who was to receive it you complains to the sending party that it never arrived and the sending party then looks to see if it was cashed etc eventually they conclude it is lost cancel it which may require a bit of signed paper from you and write a replacement cheque for high value transactions the usual means of transmission is via wire transfer directly from bank to bank this isn't done as a routine measure because the bank charges can easily be pounds or more btw if the 'lost' cheque has been cashed but it wasn't cashed by the correct person you you'll likely be required to fill out a police report called an affidavit of forgery over here which the cheque's writer then sends in to his bank and results in the cheque being sent back to the firm that cashed it for them to try and recover their money from the crook as you'll guess this is time consuming you'll also not get a replacement cheque issued until after you've filled out and returned the affidavit at least here in the us you won't gl  Cheque Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bank fraud Credit card Money Surveillance Euro Bank Automatic teller machine Corporate governance Identity theft EFTPOS Internet fraud Annuity 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines United States Postal Service Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act United Kingdom corporation tax Microeconomics Economy of Russia Confidence trick Appeal Insurance Tax Mergers and acquisitions Corporation Schabir Shaik Trial Money supply Winning Streak Mail fraud Legal tender FairTax Wheel of Fortune Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act American Express Contract Security (finance) Bond Financial audit Monetary policy Password Poker jargon Guantanamo Bay Terri Schiavo Mortgage Enron Corporation Medical prescription Tom DeLay Fractional-reserve banking Derivative (finance) Citigroup Mensal__o scandal Stock World Bank Group John C.

will a bank cash a check for you if you owe them money i only have an account with one bank i pay everything on time so that isn't my problem however just like anyone else sooner or later down the road you run into some financial difficulties and i was forced to borrow money from the bank it was about that i owe them however i have a check that i need to cash for other things i need it right now the bank i can pay by the end of the month without a problem but could they refuse to cash it if it is a check drawn on someone else's account go to their bank to cash it if you are not behind on what you owe the bank then they will cash it for you if you are delinquent on what you owe them they may not but i don't see how they can legallly not cash it any loans you have with them should be completely separate from your checking savings accounts and without your permission to draw from your checking to pay on the loan then they should not be linked just due to the fact they are at the same institution if they could simply take your money to cover the loan they could pull it directly from your account and they can not do this  Credit card Mortgage Cheque Bank Money supply Monetary policy Finance Mergers and acquisitions Student loan Insurance Hyperinflation Money Bank fraud Interest Bond Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Security (finance) Inflation Charles Ponzi FairTax Deflation (economics) Financial markets Money creation Short selling Savings and loan association Life insurance Derivative (finance) Schabir Shaik Trial Government debt Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Gold standard Internet fraud Central bank Yield curve Betting (poker) Child support U.S. public debt Economy of Russia Credit union Automatic teller machine Annuity Mutual fund Citigroup Islamic banking Wall Street Corporate finance Reserve Bank of New Zealand Great Depression Islamic economics Enron Corporation Usury Liability Lender of last resort Year 2000 problem Fiat money Stock Money laundering Financial services Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bank of America Personal finance World Bank Group Privatization Prolog Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Margin (finance) Predatory lending Repurchase agreement Capital accumulation Federal Reserve The Amazing Race Payday loan Model (economics) Debit card Bretton Woods system Poker jargon Tithe Microcredit Johnny Cash Primerica Financial Services Social Security (United States) Federal National Mortgage Association History of post-Soviet Russia Variable universal life insurance Asian financial crisis Currency Advance fee fraud Hercules Linton SCO-Linux controversies Ulster Bank Corporation Arthur Laffer Mensal__o scandal Economy of the United States Economy of Africa Construction Mortgage-backed security Fractional-reserve banking

is it smarter to max out k and ira contributions rather than pay off student loans faster loan has interest first year and for the years following can take as long as years if necessary is it smarter to maybe max k to employer contribution and only put half of max amount in ira then use the money not put in the ira to pay off the loan much faster fennell i think it's sort of a judgment call on your part when you compare the low rate of interest on the student loan with potential tax deferred returns on your retirement investment it would seem you come out ahead in terms of total dollars on the other hand you have to consider that not paying more on your student loans means less cash flow in the future because you're paying longer on the loans i tend to like your idea of maxing the k contribution and put half or maybe even of max into an ira by the way you should probably do a roth ira as opposed to a traditional one because it's tax free retirement savings not just tax deferred double or triple up on the loan payments use some of the money for non retirement savings i e a rainy day fund and you'll probably be in better financial shape to really dig into retirement savings down the road as your income increases and your debt load shrinks good luck  401(k) Annuity Deflation (economics) Bond Student loan Mortgage Debt Money Social Security (United States) Economy of Russia Life insurance Pension Credit card FairTax Personal finance Social Security debate (United States) Bretton Woods system Ponzi scheme Roth IRA Monetary policy Mutual fund Inflation Gross domestic product Government debt Variable universal life insurance Individual Retirement Account Bank Tax Hyperinflation Money supply Deficit spending Islamic banking Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Corporate finance Savings and loan association Taxation in the United States Interest Tertiary education fees in Australia Capitalism Primerica Financial Services Security (finance) Tuition Capital accumulation Economy of India Finance Income trust U.S. public debt Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 United Kingdom corporation tax Microeconomics Flat tax Education in the United States Retirement plan Financial markets Progressive tax Anarchism and capitalism Reaganomics Economy of El Salvador Economy of the United States Economy of Chile Economy of Africa Unemployment benefit Tax cut Federal Reserve Dividend Gold standard Economy of Pakistan Warren Buffett Collateralized debt obligation Asian financial crisis Municipal bond Economy of the Philippines Treasury security Derivative (finance) Free trade Marshall Plan Arthur Laffer Individual Savings Account Corporation Surplus value Yield curve PE ratio History of the United States (1918-1945) Citigroup Margin (finance) Great Depression Money creation Poker jargon Health savings account Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Bank fraud Publicly funded medicine Present value

is there someone who can help my roommate is having serious money issues late on bills alot car repossessed etc is there someone she could see for free that could help her get her life back in order she is only and in way over her head also i don't think she thinks she needs the help but it is so obvious i know a lot more then she thinks i know how could i talk to her about seeing someone without sounding judgmental i agree with going to daveramsey com for common sense advice there are financial peace university classes in just about every town nowadays these classes are very imformative informal and absolutely no pressure she wouldn't have to tell anyone her financial situation or anything like that just show up and learn the classes run depending on where you take the class i promise there is no better advice on having a healthy financial plan as for talking with her you might sound judgmental but sometimes things just need to be said calmly and nicely mention to her that you have noticed her financial problems and that since you care for her as a friend you would like to help her many people are embarrassed by money problems so she may get mad about it let her know that whenever she is ready you are willing to help her get her finances straight do not offer to help her pay her bills though if you do you will probably end up being her cash cow all of this does not matter unless she realizes she has a problem i bet she does but if she truly doesn't you won't be able to help her she has to buy into this or she won't have the discipline necessary to follow through with the budgeting process and debt repayment if she is willing to go to a financial peace class you should join her i promise that no matter how much you personally have it together you will learn more than you can imagine  Theory of conduct Microeconomics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Annuity Money Theodicy Debt Supply and demand Friends Philosophical skepticism Government debt Contract Avenue Q Neville Chamberlain Bretton Woods system Personal finance Credit card Mortgage Deflation (economics) Capitalism Craps Stock The Amazing Race Life insurance Enron Corporation The nature of God in Western theology Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Appeal The Ashlee Simpson Show Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Mad Money Great Depression Piccolo Junior Saga Gold standard Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) About a Boy Health insurance Ocean's Twelve Cheating in poker Ethics Institutional fund management U.S. public debt Student loan Poker jargon Goodness and value theory Philosophy of language Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Rent (musical) Publicly funded medicine Finance Pok__mon Live!

what is bankruptcy like some friends of ours have about dollars in credit card debt that may seem like a lot but it's piled up over many years and they spent about half that money remodeling an old house they bought which they couldn't keep and had to do a short sale which i guess can be compared to one step above a foreclosure they want to file for bankruptcy because they make so little money and made a huge mistake obviously buying their home and then spending so much money on it they also loaned about dollars to the wife's brother that he never really paid back but it sounds so scary to me that big number if they file for bankruptcy will they have a chance to explain themselves or will that huge number send up a red flag that doesn't actually exist lol it's actually quite a sad situation as they went from living in a nice home on the hill to a dinky apartment in a crowded city happens i guess oh they've stopped borrowing money of course let's put it this way almost half their debt was for the remodeling which they ended up losing the house anyway of the k left over of that was a loan which was never paid back to her brother leaving k over the course of about years as her husband wasn't working a lot and neither was she long story disabilities and such no they won't get a chance to explain it they go to the lawyer and he has them fill out paperwork they put all of their debts that they want discharged and then there is a paper with all of their assets then the lawyer files with the court and they get a court date they go to court sit in front and talk to the judge and he discharges the debts then some time later they get a paper in the mail saying that the debts are discharged yes i agree with the stop borrowing and get on a good budget but sometimes in somecases bankruptcy is the only option tell them there is no shame in it they are not losers  Deflation (economics) Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Mortgage Great Depression Debt Predatory lending Bond Poker jargon Article One of the United States Constitution Credit card Government debt Donald Trump Bank fraud Money Interest Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Bank Schabir Shaik Trial Social Security (United States) Plame affair Enron Corporation Betting (poker) Charles Ponzi EastEnders Appeal Animal Crossing Money supply Asian financial crisis Security (finance) Knots Landing Debt consolidation Hyperinflation Piccolo Junior Saga Fiat money Bankruptcy in the United States Student loan The Contender (television series) Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code George W.

what are some smart effective ways to save money i put my cents worth in another question just asked it applies here also so here it is money will go a whole lot farther if you live off of a written budget and then have the discipline to stick with it each month before getting paid my wife and i decide how much we want to spend on each category when we have spent that much we are done eating out or whatever that keeps you from continually saying it's only another which adds up to hundreds throughout the month an excellent idea for grocery shopping is to plan out all of your meals for the next week or write down what you need for those meals and then only purchase items on your list many people get to the grocery store and buy everything that sounds good which adds up and much of it goes to waste stick with what you plan to purchase savings should be set out in your budget also i used to put whatever was left over at the end of the month in savings which meant i was putting nothing in savings because i spent everything i brought home with a budget i decide how much to put in savings prior to getting paid then i transfer the money as soon as i get paid without having to worry about it later the key is telling your money where to go before you get paid without a plan that you stick to you will end up wondering where all of your money went and why you have nothing to show for it  Wal-Mart Warren Buffett Gross domestic product Hyperinflation Microeconomics FairTax Therion (band) Keynesian economics Inflation Wheel of Fortune Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Personal finance Risk management Bulk vending Electronic commerce $ale of the Century Let's Make a Deal Animal Crossing Wealth Money The Apprentice 2 Supermarket Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Economy of Russia EastEnders Supply-side economics Internet fraud Poker jargon Extreme Programming Make money fast Fiddler on the Roof Hiberno-English Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Avenue Q Enron Corporation The Inside Deficit spending Red Hot Chili Peppers Jean Schmidt Publicly funded medicine Paul Martin Boom Town (Doctor Who) The Apprentice 3 The Joker's Wild UK Singles Chart Octopus card United Kingdom corporation tax Baseball Stars Fasting Craps Live 8 CPU cache Economics Opportunity cost Knots Landing Ocean's Twelve History of the United States (1918-1945) Tesco Blood on the Tracks Food Stamp Program Neighbours Supply and demand Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Chopsticks Surveillance Social rule Bond Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans Capital accumulation Argos (retailer) Inventory Sam Walton Ethical consumerism Le Malade imaginaire Theory of conduct She Loves You Futurama (TV series - season 5) SCO-Linux controversies Religious Society of Friends Confidence trick Oil-for-Food Programme RuneScape economy Say's law Neopets Heinkel He 100 U.S. public debt 1995 Quebec referendum Married... with Children National Kidney Foundation Singapore Paul Hackett Anarchism and capitalism Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

what goes in the valid from space when you're using a debit card for billing i am trying to sign up for runescape membership with a visa debit card but it asks for the valid from and expiration date i know where the expiration date on the card but where can i find the valid from there is no choice to choose debit or credit it just hase a debit or credit choice meaning i can use both on the same form you might try to rerun your application without disclosing that it's a debit card because actually it reads like a credit card if it has the visa or mc logo this might solve your problem and that way it should not ask you for a valid from date  Debit card Credit card Visa (document) RFID MetroCard Chip and PIN British National (Overseas) - Hong Kong Stored-value card Public-key cryptography Scrip Smart card Slot machine EFTPOS Octopus card British national identity card Surveillance Schengen treaty Electronic money Bank fraud Credit card fraud Automated Clearing House The Amazing Race Passport H-1B visa Immigration to the United States Identity document London Underground Wheel of Fortune SmartRider Cheque Discover Card Indian nationality law Illegal immigration RuneScape Loyalty program David Blunkett ARCO Ulster Bank Year 2000 problem Internet fraud Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Autoroute Driver's license Randomness Oyster card Steam (content delivery) Article One of the United States Constitution United Kingdom corporation tax Match Game EMV E-ZPass Schabir Shaik Trial Filling station Electronic toll collection Russell Simmons Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks REAL ID Act Public domain Money Patent application Home Return Permit MasterCard United States Constitution Online shop Punch card Dynamical system Referendum Expert system Cross site scripting Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Legal tender Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland Notary public Telephone card Break the Bank On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Bank Automatic teller machine German car number plates Whose Line Is It Anyway?

is there a court decision in alabama that concluded that credit card accounts are written contracts i know that the federal truth in lending act defines credit card accounts as open accounts however i have found that if the courts in your state have ruled otherwise then that ruling takes precedence i am trying to find a ruling that states that the alabama courts consider credit card accounts written contracts instead of open accounts i have heard from an attorney in alabama who stated that it is indeed a written contract but he did not provide any supporting proof can anyone out there provide this information or has anyone been through a court trial regarding collection of a credit card debt that was older than the year statute of limitations in alabama alabama law appears to be contrary to your premise the alabama court of civil appeals has ruled that an account stated as opposed to an open account is not founded on the original liability but is a new agreement between parties to an original account that the statement of the account with the balance struck is correct and that the debtor will pay that amount even though there is usually a written agreement to extend credit in a credit card setting and even though there is a balance statement normally sent by a credit card issuer each month that activity occurs it seems that a subsequent agreement would be necessary to take a credit card balance outside of the open account statute of limitations  Contract Credit card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Supreme Court of the United States First Amendment to the United States Constitution Appeal Administrative law of the United States Estoppel Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 United Kingdom corporation tax Constitution Lawrence v.

tenancy in common there is no limit to the number of individuals who can hold title to one piece of real estate a property held by tenants in common can be owned by two owners or owners how are tenants in common and joint tenants similar they aren't really tenants in common hold one unity or requirement that is similar to joint tenancy that unity is the right of possession tenants in common can be between two or more persons who are related or who are unrelated husbands and wives can hold title as tenants in common john smith mary johnson and tallulah bankhead can hold title together as

consultation since www tm exchange com for example john could hold ownership mary and tallulah co tenants have the right to possess the property by one tenant or by all the tenants tallulah can live in the property by herself or share the property with john and mary neither tenant can exclude the other upon death the interest of the deceased co tenant will pass to the co tenant's heirs if tallulah died john would still hold mary would own but tallulah's would pass to whomever she designated in her will how can joint tenants become tenants in common joint tenancy requires four unities unlike tenants in common joint tenancy involves right of survivorship meaning the interest held by each tenant will pass to the other upon death the four unities necessary to create joint tenancy are time each owner must receive title at the same time title each owner must receive title on the same deed or document evidencing title interest each owner receives the same proportionate and equal share of ownership possession each owner has the identical right of possession if one of the joint tenants sells or conveys the interest created in a joint tenancy to another person the joint tenancy is broken and a tenancy in common is created joint tenants cannot stop another tenant from breaking the joint tenancy dissolving tenants in common to dissolve the tenancy in common one or more co tenants can always buy out the others the property can be sold and the proceeds distributed equitably among the owners a partition action can filed this involves going to court and asking to sell the property under court order and distribute the proceeds among the owners when a co tenant dies you may see a partition action filed when an heir may want to sell and the other co tenants do not other uses for tenants in common increasingly many properties are being sold under a tenants in common arrangement instead of a limited or general partnership a builder for example may sell portions of a new project to a number of investors who will all share an undivided interest in the property if you are considering a venture of this nature it is wise to seek the advice of legal counsel to

what's the best way to save money i spend a lot and it's not that good because i have a little girl and a baby on the way so i need to be more careful with my money i just don't know how it's not that i put my baby second it's just that i spend on her and by the way i don't have credit cards it's just when i get paid i pay my car note and insurance and then if i find anything cute for my girl i get it i dont spend on what i do not need i just don't know where my money goes with these bills i guess i should have worded it better annie my kids are everything to me oh and annie i am not poor it's just that i would like to see my money more i do put my baby fisrt and she has anything she needs and more it sounds like what you need is a written budget savings should be included in your budget the key is to put your budget together before the month begins so that you know where every last dime is going before you receive it it is a hard process and takes discipline but the benefits are wonderful the first and second months may not work well but starting in the rd month it should become almost second nature the point is to not give up with a budget you are able to determine your savings before your paycheck and then just move the money over to your savings account right now you are probably saving whatever is left over and if you are like i used to be then there is nothing left over to save i'm sure there are many sites that can help you with a budget the one i have used to get started is daveramsey com he has everything from books to classes held locally good luck one of the best gifts you can give your children is a financially stable home  Social Security (United States) Money Personal finance Credit card FairTax Microeconomics Economy of Russia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bank Bond Wheel of Fortune Insurance Capitalism Supply-side economics Empire Burlesque Labour economics Unemployment benefit Publicly funded medicine Arthur Laffer Keynesian economics Government debt Hyperinflation Social Security debate (United States) Pitaten Health insurance Gold standard EastEnders Gross domestic product Canadian federal budget, 2005 Jon Secada Internet fraud Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Monopoly (game) U.S. public debt Contract Anime Capital accumulation Anarchism and capitalism Evan Mecham Social rule Economy of the United States New Deal AFI 100 Years series Leeds United F.C.

why are there higher interest rates on smaller loans i am studying business but i just don't understand this part it says there are statutes allowing higher interest rates on small loans to help borrowers who are in need of funds but can't get loans on interest rates below the normal lawful maximum can anyone explain thanks lol get those automated things out of here i have awesome credit and i am a business major studying to become an attorney just wondering high interest rates tend to mean high risk small loans are often higher risk than larger ones because they are often to individuals without the resources to earn the small amount they need above a certain amount the repayment rate is so low that no amount of interest makes it worth the risk so massive high risk loans are simply out of the question for banks anyway also high interest on a small loan is still not that much interest cash wise that's why there's legislation on how big the loan can be the idea is that the average borrower should be able to eventually pay off a loan even with high interest and get off the debt treadmill without undue hardship above a certain amount of principal that's impossible in theory even with the legally allowed rates generally a person can get into debt beyond their ability to get out but this at least reduces that likelihood hope this helps and thanks for the question it really challenged my brain owen  Mortgage Debt Bond Insurance Bank Student loan Monetary policy Credit card Islamic banking Microcredit Finance Capital accumulation Inflation Money Usury Hyperinflation Government debt Collateralized debt obligation Tertiary education fees in Australia Corporate finance Predatory lending Federal Reserve Economy of Russia Savings and loan association Corporation U.S. public debt Bretton Woods system 401(k) Municipal bond Marshall Plan Life insurance Microeconomics Capitalism Financial markets Gold standard Betting (poker) Yield curve Mortgage-backed security Social Security (United States) Arbitrage Intellectual property Islamic economics Security (finance) Lender of last resort Bank fraud United Kingdom corporation tax Developing countries' debt Social Security debate (United States) Money supply Citigroup Mergers and acquisitions Labor theory of value Primerica Financial Services Education in the United States Mutual fund Debt levels and flows Personal finance Tax Interest rate High-yield debt Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Modern portfolio theory Short selling American individualist anarchism Anarchism and capitalism Economy of Pakistan Moody's Great Depression Lend-Lease Publicly funded medicine Minimum wage Free trade Deficit spending Unemployment benefit Theory of conduct Financial services Debt consolidation Stock Wealth Fractional-reserve banking Extreme Programming Privatization Pound sterling School of Salamanca Cost of capital Venture capital Health insurance Article One of the United States Constitution Money creation Investment bank

if you are years old what jobs are available like a cashier does anybody know a place i dont think any large establishment is allowed to put a yo on the till its too much responsibility and there is always a real dangerous risk of being held up for the money by theives which at you are not old enough to cope with and are not covered by the company insurance either usually cashiers are staff who started off loading up the shelves and then worked their way up to being a cashier through trust and reliability if thats what you want to do then apply for a saturday job in the storeroom packing things into order and tidying up and see where you go from there good luck ps i also would like to say i think at years old it is very comendable indeed that you are showing such great self initiative and self motivation in finding yourself a part time job well done you  Wal-Mart Insurance Mutual fund Life insurance Argos (retailer) Bank Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Aldi Social rule Unemployment 2000 Australian Grand Prix Betting (poker) Unemployment benefit Freeters Lloyd's of London Commodity markets Outsourcing Health insurance Risk management Social Security (United States) Final Fantasy XI Baseball United Kingdom corporation tax Public-key cryptography EastEnders Pitaten Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited Rugby union positions Octopus card Labour economics Agent handling W.

recently received credit card change in terms what if i decline i got in the mail yesterday a letter stating some of my credit card fees are going up it also says i can decline these and close my account then it says i can pay off my account at the current terms my question is how does this affect my credit score and report if i choose to decline pj thats so true i didnt think of it that way i'm trying to pay off all my cards and i was just wondering if declining and canceling the card was an easier way to go since the offer is there but so far it seems not since i have had this card the longest i think i will just pay it off and keep it open thats the best thing to do right your credit score might take a small hit closing the account will decrease your available credit which might cause your debt to available credit ratio to increase if you've had the card for an extended time you will lose that history however your score should quickly rebound  Credit card Credit score Bank Student loan Neopets Bond Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Social Security (United States) Monty Hall problem Debt Mortgage Wheel of Fortune Citigroup Batting average Ford Motor Company Beatmania IIDX Contract bridge Life insurance Spam (electronic) Personal finance Mail Mutual fund Insurance Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Double-entry book-keeping Unemployment benefit Credit card fraud SAT Boston Red Sox Article One of the United States Constitution Pump It Up Billboard Hot 100 Baccarat Internet fraud Betting (poker) Economy of Russia Economy of Chile $ale of the Century Minimum wage Blackjack Xbox Live Microeconomics Annuity EFTPOS Futures contract Government debt Octopus card Topps Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Sears Holdings Corporation International League Euro Poker jargon Craps Law of value New York Giants Primerica Financial Services M16 (rifle) Voter turnout Phishing Debt consolidation Social Security debate (United States) Temasek Holdings Animal Crossing Kyoto Protocol Surveillance Babe Ruth Financial services United States Postal Service Interest Identity theft Oakland Athletics U.S. public debt Floppy disk E-mail Finance Mainframe computer Arthur Laffer America Online Bretton Woods system Capitalism Schabir Shaik Trial Stamp collecting The Amazing Race Table tennis FairTax New York Knicks Prisoner's dilemma Frequent flyer program Legal tender Slot machine Credit history World Series Advance fee fraud Monetary policy Economy of Sri Lanka Chicago Cubs Deflation (economics) Micropayment H-1B visa

what can a k used for well obviously it is for retirement if you are asking if it can be used for borrowing money the answer is yes extremely bad idea but it can be done the problem with borrowing against a k is that when you are no longer part of the k the loan is due in full within some short period of time or days i think if the loan is not repaid in that time frame then it is considered a premature withdrawal and the irs will charge you the penalty and you will have to pay taxes on the outstanding debt and there are many reasons for dropping out of the k plan if you get fired you are no longer part of the plan and when you are looking for a new job that is about the worst time to have a loan come due if you die you are no longer part of the plan at this point it doesn't make any difference to you but it's not a good idea to have a loan come due when your survivors are trying to straighten out your estate and the kicker is that if the company you work for gets bought goes out of business etc the plan is normally closed which means you are no longer part of the plan and the loan is due sometimes but not always the plan rolls over in that situation bad bad idea to borrow against a k  Mortgage Life insurance Student loan Annuity Deflation (economics) 401(k) Debt Islamic banking Short selling Microcredit Hyperinflation Money Primerica Financial Services Predatory lending United Kingdom corporation tax Mutual fund Stock Insurance Government debt Bank fraud Usury Bretton Woods system Great Depression Babylonian law Social Security (United States) Finance Credit card Bank Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Personal finance Inflation Poker jargon Interest Economy of the United States Keynesian economics Health insurance Subsidy Capitalism Marshall Plan Tertiary education fees in Australia Variable universal life insurance Annual percentage rate FairTax School of Salamanca History of the United States (1918-1945) Social Credit Municipal bond Savings and loan association Margin (finance) Unemployment benefit Schabir Shaik Trial Security (finance) Financial markets Islamic economics Mergers and acquisitions Microeconomics Donald Trump Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Debt bondage Asian financial crisis Social Security debate (United States) Warren Buffett Corporation Mortgage-backed security Deficit spending Debt levels and flows George W.

if your a kid age how do you make money without a job im a kid age and im wondering how make money but im young to have a job so mcdonalds tell me so do u have ne ideas on how make money i had one idea where i went to the cent store bought cases of choclate and sell them for a dollar ne other ideas i know the feeling i'm a year old engineer but remember all too well the frustration of having to wait until i got my first job at mcdonalds the answer to this question is the same regardless of a persons age or ability it will be completely dictated by supply and demand in your area what works in my town may not work as well in yours so i'd suggest asking around to see what's been most profitable for other young adults in your area one thing that cannot be stressed enough is the importance of advertising yourself if you're good with animals then you might want to consider asking your local pet store if you can put up a flyer offering a dog walking service if you know anyone that plays golf then get them to teach you how to caddy over a game or two and then ask your local golf course if you can advertise there it can be a great way to meet local business people which will be invaluable when you're older if there are expensive houses in or near your neighborhood with tennis courts then you might want to try a letterbox drop offering services as a ball boy rich people love to impress others if you can help them do it then chances are they'll pay you more than if you were gardening regardless of what you do always use common sense and let someone you trust know your plans especially when dealing with strangers best of luck you're obviously resourceful and willing to work i'm sure you'll have no problems doing well in life no matter what you wind up doing  Game show Supply and demand Caddy Animal Crossing Wal-Mart Wealth Neopets Monopoly (game) Hyperinflation Theory of conduct Social rule Grand Forks, North Dakota Trailer Park Boys Warren Buffett Live 8 Inflation Economics Poker jargon Keynesian economics Avenue Q Contract Education in the People's Republic of China Electronic commerce Tennis Wall Street The Apprentice 2 50 Cent Community emergency response team Pitaten Property (ownership right) Anarchism and capitalism Dot-com Graduate school George Costanza Divorce Knots Landing Externality PE ratio Privatization Professional golf tours Economy of Russia Life insurance Capital accumulation Episodes of Lost (Season 1) New Deal Mutual fund American individualist anarchism Trust (Law) USA Motivation Say's law Illegal drug trade Outsourcing Labor theory of value Motion picture rating system Paul Martin Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Socrates The Adventures of Pete & Pete Survivor (novel) Babe Ruth Great Depression Ed, Edd n Eddy Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Cable television The Fairly OddParents Deflation (economics) Bank Aphasia Airline Flat tax SCO-Linux controversies Tariff Philip J.

how is my k help me in retirement if i'm losing money in it since opening it it grows every month about which is what i put into it but looses about every month and if it grows say for years to k and in the last year before retirement it loses its value what good is the k program for if it goes up and down in years i'll have equal chances of making money losing money or just getting the same money i put in how safe is that over years your money should grow if you recently put the money into your k you were unfortunate to run into a market correction however if you have invested for quite some time you need to look at your stocks mutual funds and start discarding the losers if you're young you can afford to take some risks on stocks but you should diversify your portfolio so that you can weather the ups and downs of each market fluctuation however yes there is some risk when you invest that you may lose everything especially if you pick small companies you can gain big or lose everything if you pick mainly the s p stocks you will grow your money at a slow rate making your k grow requires you to look every couple of months and fine tune where you invest you can't just put it into the market and wait years before checking on it for the most part you should be able to make money you just may not be able to make a lot if you are unlucky remember you are only losing gaining potential money it is not final until you actually sell your stocks mutual funds plus with mutual funds and some stocks you get dividends that you can reinvest to increase your shares which compounded over years can also add up you are also decreasing your current income now with your k that can place your income in a lower tax bracket plus the growth of your k is tax free until you start collecting your money at retirement so in short you can safely grow your money but without risk you won't gain much with your k but overall you gain when you consider the tax implications  Bond Annuity PE ratio Capital accumulation Income trust Warren Buffett 401(k) Life insurance Short selling Social Security debate (United States) Microeconomics United Kingdom corporation tax Economy of Russia Dividend Hedge fund Flat tax Taxation in the United States Surplus value Cost of capital Progressive tax Insurance Money supply Stock FairTax Tax Supply-side economics Bank Modern portfolio theory Bretton Woods system Corporation Economy of Pakistan Privatization Economy of India Capitalism Security (finance) Keynesian economics Arbitrage Publicly funded medicine Investment bank Financial markets Individual Savings Account Divorce Ra (board game) Poker jargon Variable universal life insurance Finance Venture capital Derivative (finance) Stock market Citigroup Interest Monopoly (game) Financial services Internet fraud Economy of Chile Inflation Debt Mergers and acquisitions Ponzi scheme Institutional fund management Property tax Capital asset pricing model Gross domestic product Asian financial crisis Leverage (finance) Betting (poker) NASDAQ Tax cut Anarchism and capitalism Credit card Sears Holdings Corporation Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Free trade Federal Reserve Microcredit Collateralized debt obligation Primerica Financial Services Mad Money Gold as an investment Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Eugene Fama Yield curve Capital gains tax Rational pricing Gold standard Risk Economy of Sri Lanka Insider trading Nuclear power Economy of Iceland Foreign exchange market Social Security (United States)

help to prevent garnishment of children's college savings i have credit cards judgments against me all purchased by an aggressive collection agency legal firm after divorce i live paycheck to paycheck and have checking accounts and keep less than in each they have the sheriff collect on bofa about once per month my question is there somewhere i can save money for my two children in my current marriage so i can build college savings i don't care about money for me i just need to get them through college ages and i do not have money to speak to a professional but maybe some help here and a pointer to the best book on how to protect assets against garnishments i do not have a house no longer own anything of value i cannot pay off all the debt interest and fees required of the collector and cannot afford any payments i must remain under their radar until i can save for college small cashier checks hidden at work will not grow until i can invest them i hope someone can help thank you in advance you can open a college plan in your child's name the iowa one has vanguard as their accounts and is probably the best one you do not have to go to a school in iowa to use it either you can set it up in their name and you should be good to go but you have profound financial problems and you do need some professional help i would start with negotiating the balance the problem though is it sounds like you ignored them long enough to take legal action the truth is most debt agencies buy debt meaning they buy someone else's debt for cents on the dollar so as long as they collect of the debt they are happy this often means you can cut your debt by at least if you challenge the amount but it is likely too late for that if you really want to accumulate money you need to generate cash that can be put into a cashiers check or money order and sent to the plan the iowa plan accepts as low as and it doesn't have to be regular payments either way you need some damage control i see it over and over again parents with lots of debt raise kids who generate tons of debt you need to pay up and show your kids how to pay off debt and save for the future they will learn by your example the best thing you can do ask for contributions from family in leiu of birthday and christmas presents they can write checks that get deposited into the kids accounts this also helps protect kids in case of divorce its sad to see kids drop out of college because parents fight over who pays and the college fund had been raided years before you'll never see a kid more bitter towards their parents  Divorce Social Security (United States) Bank Bond Mortgage Money Child support FairTax Personal finance Annuity Bretton Woods system Microeconomics Debt Deflation (economics) Economy of Russia Insurance Mutual fund Cheque Hyperinflation Security (finance) Capital accumulation Money supply Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Life insurance Mergers and acquisitions Internet fraud Gold standard Student loan Poker jargon Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Corporate finance Social Security debate (United States) Government debt Keynesian economics Wal-Mart Publicly funded medicine Economy of the United States Derivative (finance) Euro Pension Tax Arthur Laffer Temasek Holdings Interest History of the United States (1918-1945) Inflation United Kingdom corporation tax Health insurance Finance Fiat money Estoppel Bank fraud Legal tender Citigroup Gross domestic product Short selling U.S. public debt Donald Trump Corporation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Surveillance Marshall Plan Advance fee fraud Payroll Hillary Rodham Clinton Contract Capitalism Primerica Financial Services Variable universal life insurance Financial services Warren Buffett Taxation in the United States National Kidney Foundation Singapore Food Stamp Program Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation The Amazing Race Developing countries' debt Asian financial crisis Betting (poker) Article One of the United States Constitution Kyoto Protocol PE ratio MMORPG Stock Asset National Football League Tom DeLay SCO-Linux controversies Enron Corporation Great Depression Octopus card Babylonian law Education in the People's Republic of China Unemployment

when financing a home remodel which do you recommend refinancing or a line of credit caveat i am only considering refinancing my second which is about of my total home loan the interest only varies by less then half a percent from the refi versus the line of credit i would have to know a little more about what you are looking to do with your future finances inclusive of this property and how exactly you have your home financed now in order to give you a precise assessment of what the appropriate move would be but generally speaking an equity line is nice and it's convenient but in the same respect it can become a burden just like a high balance credit card if you have a plan already in place to be able to pay that heloc home equity line of credit off in a short schedule of payments than go for the heloc if you do not then your best choice is to do a straight refinance you will get the money at a lower cost no matter how insignificant a difference in rate and you will kill two birds with one stone you see most everybody that gets a heloc ends up refinancing again with in the following year or two in an attempt to consolidate their debt in almost every case you end up saving a lot of money in a debt consolidation like that but you lose money by having to refinance a second time to close the heloc i always say do it right do it once  Debt Primerica Financial Services Mortgage Refinancing Credit card Economy of Russia Debt consolidation Deflation (economics) Personal finance Bond Corporate finance Mortgage-backed security Financial services Government debt Monetary policy Security (finance) Microeconomics Interest Annuity Finance Bank Student loan Bretton Woods system Insurance Money Collateralized debt obligation Capital accumulation Predatory lending Social Security (United States) Economy of Pakistan United Kingdom corporation tax Tax Inflation Divorce FairTax Cost of capital Central bank Savings and loan association Futures contract Taxation in the United States Microcredit Capitalism Mutual fund Estoppel CPU cache Money supply High-yield debt Stock Education in the United States Islamic banking Warner Music Group Euro Investment bank Debt levels and flows Mergers and acquisitions Poker jargon Social Security debate (United States) Deficit 401(k) Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Privatization Financial audit Real estate bubble Federal National Mortgage Association Arbitrage Economy of the United States Government National Mortgage Association Temasek Holdings Gold standard Hyperinflation History of the United States (1918-1945) Leveraged buyout Keynesian economics Modigliani-Miller theorem Affirmative action Municipal bond Appeal Donald Trump Yield curve Economy of Ghana Schabir Shaik Trial Social Credit Education in the People's Republic of China Economy of Chile Deficit spending Federal Reserve Progressive tax Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 U.S. public debt Political subdivisions of New York State

the natwest has anyone tried to reclaim their bank charges back from the natwest bank nope but work for natwest so you can imagine you'll only get back what is seen to be 'unfair' charges don't expect every charge to be refunded as if you've incurred charges the first ones will be a result of your actions i e going overdrawn and when you claim back charges hun the reason why it takes so long is because some poor staff member has to sit there and go through years worth of your statements because as you can imagine people like to claim for more than what they're entitled to but put in a claim hun you'll get back what you're entitled to good luck xx  International cricket in 2005 2005 English cricket season Credit card NatWest Attila the Hun Poker jargon American individualist anarchism Money Summa Theologiae Rick Santorum Warranty Estoppel Plame affair Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act The Apprentice 3 Credit card fraud SAT Goodness and value theory 2005 Hungarian Grand Prix Zhao Yun Theory of conduct Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Luck Charles Taze Russell Trust (Law) USA Islamic banking Laisenia Qarase Xenu British National Party Ulster Bank United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East United Airlines Flight 93 Tax Tower 42 Anti-Defamation League Usury Predatory lending Insurance Gold standard Huns Aladdin (1992 film) FairTax Government of India Act 1935 John Kerry military service controversy Octopus card Enron Corporation Garda S__och__na Blonde on Blonde 2005 English cricket season (15-30 June) Center for Science and Culture Social rule Publicly funded medicine Intelligent design Microeconomics Scientology controversy The nature of God in Western theology Taxation in the United States Speaker of the British House of Commons Public good Bernard Williams RuneScape Ontological argument Karma Heinkel He 112 Education in England Action potential Pok__mon Chronicles Sydney Riot of 1879 Otakon Electric boat Russell T.

can he escape federal student loans i just found out that my cousin's cousin third cousin has moved back to germany with student loan debt mostly federal he earned a b s in physics from a private university but could not find a job in the u s near family so he moved back to germany with his mom without plans to pay back his school loans he has a u s green card he has always been very responsible and even seemed frugal for the past years i've known him but claims per my cousin that he can't afford these payments on his salary and that it won't affect him in germany can he get away with this can the lenders have his wages garnished or affect his credit if he's working and living overseas i don't know if his new employer is a german or american company i would think the lenders would have some recourse i thought his school would put a hold on his degree once he starts missing payments he graduated in june i'm not sure that this will happen because he doesn't actually owe money to his university only to the goverment loans and a private lender that would be interesting if they could hold his degree for non payment it's true that a school can refuse to release your degree or paperwork if you have fees due them that you haven't paid but federal student loans shouldn't fall into this category presumably he took out the loan to pay for school if he actually paid the school then they would have no reason to hold his degree federally insured student loans means that the federal government will make good in the event that he doesn't pay sounds like he's not going to pay so at some point the government will pay the balance for him however it's hard to escape student loans in the normal sense because they can't be bankrupted the fact that it's a federally subsidized loan means that they don't even have to sue him and get a judgment as with most loans if he moves back to the us he'll likely be subject to garnishment the bigger issue is that it is ethically wrong to take out a loan with no intention of paying it back it sounds like he's using the i can't find a job in my field excuse to avoid his commitments personally i have a bs in physics and there are more than enough jobs out there remember you're a taxpayer he's leaving you to pay the bill  Bond Mortgage Bank Government debt Life insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Insurance Education in the United States Debt Unemployment benefit Corporation Taxation in the United States Graduate school Education in Germany Capitalism Inflation Predatory lending Microeconomics Donald Trump Economy of Russia Tax Deflation (economics) Health insurance Economy of the United States Money Child support Wal-Mart Weimar Republic 401(k) Bretton Woods system Usury FairTax Debt consolidation Schabir Shaik Trial History of the United States (1918-1945) Finance Subsidy United Kingdom corporation tax Interest Reparations for slavery Citigroup Unemployment Annuity Capital accumulation Publicly funded medicine Gold standard Anarchism and capitalism Minimum wage Short selling Government National Mortgage Association Economy of India Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Plame affair United States Postal Service Security (finance) U.S. public debt Internet fraud Social Security debate (United States) Money supply Financial markets Appeal Bank fraud History of post-Soviet Russia Tax resistance Goodness and value theory Medicare (Canada) Professor Barbara Boxer Social Credit Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Affirmative action Compensation of employees Divorce Mutual fund Payroll Epistemology Developing countries' debt Economy of Pakistan Rick Santorum Theodicy Federal National Mortgage Association Arthur Laffer Tertiary education fees in Australia Temasek Holdings Tuition Personal finance Mensal__o scandal Article One of the United States Constitution

what is the best way to pay your credit cards to maximize your credit score is it better to pay off your credit card statement in full each month or should you leave a small balance each month like i've heard conflicting things for example paying each bill in full is better for your credit score versus leaving a dollar balance i've heard leaving a small balance is supposed to show that you know how to pay off a debt and help your credit score even more i don't know what to believe your thoughts as long as you make any minimum payment it reflects positively for your credit score because credit ratings take into account how many accounts in good standing you have this means your payment history is good no late payments no missed payments or payments less than the minimum payment required high balances reflect negatively on your credit score the more available credit you have credit limit outstanding the better the score even if you pay your balance in full every month your credit score will show a balance because there is a lag in between paying your card and reporting to the credit bureaus so if you pay in full it reduces your interest payments and also lowers your outstanding revolving balance both of these are good for you the only reason why some people mention that you should keep a small balance is because the credit lenders like that because they make interest off of you that way they can send you more offers for more useless credit in the hopes of generating more interest fees from you  Credit card Student loan Credit score Mortgage Deflation (economics) Bank Debt Collateralized debt obligation Credit history Insurance Social Security (United States) Gold standard Government debt Money Microeconomics Taxation in the United States Short selling Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Monetary policy Inflation United Kingdom corporation tax Debt consolidation Health insurance Interest Annuity Supply and demand Keynesian economics Mutual fund Government National Mortgage Association Finance Economy of Russia Legal tender Refinancing Estoppel Minimum wage Internet fraud Financial audit History of the United States (1918-1945) Schabir Shaik Trial Poker jargon Surveillance Baccarat Micropayment Copyleft Economy of Pakistan Citigroup Mortgage-backed security Unemployment Primerica Financial Services Law of value Craps Corporate finance Graduate school Food Stamp Program Municipal bond Balance of payments Arthur Laffer Octopus card Life insurance Betting (poker) Futures contract Economy of the United States Accounting methods 401(k) Personal finance Blackjack Predatory lending Fiat money Dividend Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Debit card Capitalism Arbitrage Grade (education) MMORPG Temasek Holdings Derivative (finance) Tax Salary cap Pension Plame affair Social Security debate (United States) Certificate of deposit Capital accumulation London Congestion Charge Euro Tertiary education fees in Australia Education in the United States Financial services Marshall Plan Value added tax Contract bridge Unemployment benefit Annual percentage rate Weimar Republic Athenian democracy

is debt consolidation a smart move my husband and i are concern about our incomes right now he started a job where he makes half of what he used to make before i wonder if debt consolidation is a good way out i wonder what things can you consolidate credit cards car payments mortage medical bills student loans things like that is it effective has anyone been unsuccessful practically any type of loan can be wrapped into the debt consolidation process common types include finance charges late fees and overdraft charges credit cards personal loans utility bills medical bills car loans store cards gas cards and back taxes a debt consolidation loan allows you to condense your monthly payments into a single simple bill while lowering your interest rates and helping you pay down your debts more quickly and easily it is also an essential tool in avoiding the much more serious step of declaring bankruptcy http badcredits awardspace com loan consolidation htm unlike bankruptcy in which debts are cancelled and your credit rating collapses completely debt consolidation loans are essentially a type of refinancing where several old loans are replaced with a new one that has more favorable terms your loan consultant will negotiate with creditors on your behalf so you ll no longer have to deal with harassing phone calls and daily mail  Credit card Mortgage Student loan Debt consolidation Money Insurance Deflation (economics) Bond Primerica Financial Services United Kingdom corporation tax Interest Economy of Russia Credit score Predatory lending Government debt Security (finance) Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Islamic banking Personal finance Schabir Shaik Trial Tertiary education fees in Australia Annuity Refinancing Gold standard Usury Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Social Security (United States) Donald Trump Bretton Woods system Tax U.S. public debt Credit repair Bankruptcy 401(k) Article One of the United States Constitution Hillary Rodham Clinton Legal tender Leeds United F.C.

what recourse do cosigners have when they have to pay the whole amount of the loan a couple of years ago my girlfriend's son decided he just had to buy a motorcycle he went out in search of a loan but because of his poor credit score and well known habits of not paying his bills no one would give him any money without a cosigner i begged her not to sign for him but she for some reason did it anyways well he's ended up with a free motorcycle now and she says there's nothing she can do the bike is just about paid off now and her son's using our bikes for spare parts when we're not around i think we need to sell this bike to at least get some of the money that was paid in can this be done legally he's only made one or two payments we live in indiana if state laws come into play presumably your girlfriend is a joint owner of the vehicle so she has some rights but if he also owns it she can't just sell it without his consent legally you'd probably need to sue him for full possession of the bike i can't imagine your girlfriend will consider taking her own kid to court so unless he willingly consents there's probably nothing you can do except to never let it happen again  Mortgage Student loan Donald Trump American individualist anarchism Credit card Bond Money Concurrent estate Estoppel Insurance Article One of the United States Constitution Leasing Babylonian law Islamic banking Eminent domain Capitalism Property (ownership right) Annuity Divorce Life insurance BMW First-sale doctrine Appeal Consensual crime Corporation Capital accumulation United Kingdom corporation tax Contract Motorcycle GNU General Public License Child support Copyright Dividend Short selling Patent Deflation (economics) The Amazing Race Allodial title Copyleft Civil unions in the United Kingdom Bretton Woods system Tax Trademark Stock Intellectual property Government National Mortgage Association Assignment (law) Trust (Law) USA Taxation in the United States Same-sex marriage in the United States Legal aid SCO-Linux controversies Minimum wage Derivative (finance) Federal Reserve Gold standard Arguments for and against drug prohibition Anarchism and capitalism Legal tender Government of Maryland Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Jay Leno Bike lane debate Security (finance) Schwinn Bicycle Company Vehicular cycling Debt Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 12 Slavery Prostitution in Germany Usury Auto insurance Driver's license Prostitution Amway Copyright law of the United Kingdom Marriage Leeds United F.C.

need mortgage fico score advise my husband and i are getting ready to apply for a mortgage i checked our fico scores his is mine is should we apply together or should he apply by himself since his score is better also i've heard that if i apply for a mortgage with a number of companies over a two week period it would count as one application do you know if it is true or if each application will bring our scores down thank you both of your scores are excellent but the deciding factor on whether to apply together or separately depends on the type of loan you're looking for banks take the lowest credit score of the two and a difference in points could represent a higher or lower interest rate if you're basing your loan on scores and not income your best option would be to apply using him on the mortgage and title and you on title only that way you're ensured you have a claim on the property and not only him inquire thru mortgage bankers because they might give you more options give yourself a window of days for the credit hits and ask your morgage consultant to disclose everything before you commit to any loan program ask questions are they offering interest only or principal and interest is it a fixed rate for the duration of the loan or will it adjust is there a pre payment penalty involved the so called no closing cost loans charge the closing costs in the rate hidden no one works for free and this is not always the best route weigh all options carefully since it's a very important desicion that will affect or more years of your life best of luck  Student loan Credit score Life insurance Bond Islamic banking Interest Bank Mortgage-backed security Annuity Insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Primerica Financial Services 401(k) United Kingdom corporation tax Microcredit Security (finance) Monetary policy Corporate finance Deflation (economics) FairTax Annual percentage rate Debt Certificate of deposit Gold standard Citigroup Federal National Mortgage Association Collateralized mortgage obligation Education in the United States Refinancing Predatory lending Appeal Mutual fund Personal finance Savings and loan association Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Allodial title Government National Mortgage Association Economy of Russia Bretton Woods system Flat tax Construction Title insurance Education in the People's Republic of China Money Unemployment benefit Interest rate Islamic economics Microeconomics Bank fraud Call centre Arbitrage Federal Reserve ELO rating system Municipal bond Subsidy Expert system Concurrent estate Toronto-Dominion Bank Derivative (finance) Economic inequality Virtual memory Credit rating agency World Bank Group Normal distribution Betting (poker) Inflation Schabir Shaik Trial 2005 United States Grand Prix GED History of the United States (1918-1945) Welding Compiler optimization NASDAQ Economy of the United States Prostate cancer Grade (education) Free trade Labour economics Yield curve Payday loan Central bank Real estate bubble Redundant array of independent disks Donald Trump Consumer finance Variable universal life insurance Tax Securitization

can an ach debit return yes it can achs of all types can return when you speak of ach debit are you the one initiating the transaction when an ach is processed from the originator for a debit this means the money is going from somewhere else to their bank account its backwards of what you would think if you are on the other end this means the money is leaving your account if the ach is a credit this means its leaving the originator and going to the recieving end in an ach debit the bank will give the originator the money on good faith until the actual transaction is collected about or days later if the other bank sends back an nsf or account closed the bank will take the money back from the origiator in an ach credit the bank will send the money first then try and deduct the money from the originators bank this is two step process the ach department in the bank is not the same department that handles the originator's your account sometimes its even outsourced so what happens is the ach department will send the money then send a request for the money to be debited from the originator's account i know the credit and debit thing doesnt make sense to alot of people if the originator doesnt have enough money to cover the transaction they send a note back to the ach department to reverse the ach thus returning it this is why you might see an ach deposit and or hours later it gets removed also remember anyone i spoke about above can reverse an ach up to hours this means even though a direct deposit goes through it can be pulled back  Automated Clearing House Debit card Credit card Money EFTPOS Bank Double-entry book-keeping Electronic money Internet fraud Bank fraud Surveillance Octopus card United Kingdom corporation tax Payroll Monetary policy Financial audit Interac Short selling Money supply Gold standard Credit card fraud Automatic teller machine MetroCard Ulster Bank London Underground Mortgage Margin (finance) Transaction processing Advance fee fraud Cheque Annuity Smart card ACID Contract Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Bond Swingout E-ZPass Economy of India Letter of credit Accountancy Money laundering Financial services Magnet Capital accumulation Economy of Russia Offshoring Legal tender Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Clearstream Stored-value card Islamic banking Electronic toll collection Hyperinflation Personal finance Money creation Noah Bank of America File system Depreciation Globalization Witches (Discworld) Flat tax Anarchism and capitalism Reserve requirements Apostolic Constitutions Toll road Liberty Dollar Euro Canadian dollar Tax Finance Deflation (economics) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mergers and acquisitions Surplus value Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Economy of the Philippines Insurance Credit union Currency Textile manufacturing Bank of China (Hong Kong) Plame affair Outsourcing Mail fraud Dai dai shogi Time-based currency Tai shogi Fractional-reserve banking Schabir Shaik Trial Causality Banknote Slot machine Health savings account E-gold

how can i get out of debt should i risk loosing everything and start over makes less than bills i just got laidoff and my unemployment check does not cover the bills what should i do i went through a divorce a year ago where i absorbed all of my ex wife's debt while she got all of the assets i considered filing for bankruptcy but decided against it here's the way i started dealing with my debt first if you have a loan or credit card call the bank and explain your situation these businesses want their money and will usually work with you to avoid losing out completely that should lower how much is due each month until you can start getting a regular paycheck next with what you can pay pay only the minimum on everything but the credit card loan with the highest interest rate once that's paid off go to the next highest depending on how much you owe this could take a long time but it can be done in a situation similar to yours my bank floated me a personal loan based on my solid relationship with them it was a loan that covered my utility bills until i got a job finally most of us americans which i assume you to be spend incredible amounts of money eating at mcdonald's and similar fast food joints shopping for food you can prepare yourself will save you money unless you buy massive amounts of frozen dinners my bank also offers free financial advise which i used to help develop my plan to pay off my debt while avoiding becoming homeless check with your bank to see whether they offer similar advise let the experts tell you how to proceed and you'll be surprised at what you can do with what little you have  Bank Debt Credit card Interest Student loan Mortgage Deflation (economics) Bond Money supply FairTax Government debt Insurance Money Monetary policy Security (finance) Marshall Plan Social Security (United States) Derivative (finance) Hyperinflation Microcredit Economy of Russia Predatory lending Economy of the United States History of the United States (1918-1945) Annuity Life insurance Bretton Woods system Capitalism Mutual fund Great Depression Primerica Financial Services Personal finance Investment bank Inflation Bank fraud Capital accumulation Corporate finance Finance Social Credit Financial services Donald Trump Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Economy of India Schabir Shaik Trial United Kingdom corporation tax Enron Corporation Baccarat Debt consolidation Credit score Gold standard Arbitrage Microeconomics Credit derivative Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Taxation in the United States Economy of Chile Unemployment benefit Short selling Privatization Social Security debate (United States) Asian financial crisis Divorce Economy of Argentina Fractional-reserve banking The Amazing Race Dot-com Octopus card 401(k) Collateralized debt obligation Economy of Pakistan Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Minimum wage Hillary Rodham Clinton Cooperative Betting (poker) Yield curve Money creation Mortgage-backed security Small business Unemployment Wall Street Economy of Africa Savings and loan association Flat tax EastEnders Islamic economics Arthur Laffer Economic inequality Usury Health insurance

what makes the money worth chasing isn't there any other way to your goals money is simply a medium of exchange the more money you have the more and better the thing you can exchange it for this is not a mercenary concept it wouldn't matter if you were exchanging flour for honey or a rake for a shovel you trade around to get the things you need when you collect more money than you will ever possibly need however your only options are to hoard it or give some away the beauty of giving it away is that you get to decide who to give it to now you are lending your support to a cause that you believe in and you are putting your money where your mouth is people who do not have money are very likely to value it and less likely to give it away when they get it they are very likely to hoard it or squander it however as they probably have little or no conception of how to budget and manage money money is a tool just like a rake or a shovel in the right hands a tool can be used to cultivate in the wrong hands that same tool can be used to maim and harm what makes money worth chasing is that if you catch it you get to decide what to do with it  Poker jargon Inflation Monetary policy American individualist anarchism Theory of conduct Money Donald Trump Capital accumulation Chopsticks Say's law Microeconomics Tool Political economy Chess strategy and tactics Hyperinflation Surplus value Contract Wealth Gold standard Corporate finance Gold as an investment Deflation (economics) Financial markets Exchange rate Economics Gift economy Brewery Alcoholics Anonymous Keynesian economics Make money fast Usury Ontological argument Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Agriculture Extreme Programming Animal Crossing Surplus product Anarchism and capitalism Exchange value Characters in the Smurfs Stock United States dollar EastEnders Option Option style Gresham's law Bank The Joker's Wild Goodness and value theory Security (finance) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Meme Philosophical skepticism Economy of Pakistan School of Salamanca Microsoft Objective-C Copyleft Tag Great Teacher Onizuka Boston Red Sox Radio Yerevan Monopoly (game) Supply-side economics Independence Party (Iceland) Betting (poker) Commodity Sheepshead 613 mitzvot Serial killer Current teachings of Prem Rawat Liberalism George Soros Human Craps Public policy Cultural Revolution Economy of Russia Psychiatric hospital Monetarism Anarchism and society Money creation Ocean's Twelve President (game) Let's Make a Deal Bretton Woods system Therion (band) Mutual fund Denis Law Debugging Government debt Prolog Tasaday Population transfer Day trading Flat tax Law of value Political campaign

any body knows someting about forex i want to invest some money and someone talk to me about forex do you have experience on this matter thanks investing in the forex market is quite a risky venture there are all sorts of companies out there trying to sell you software that claims to be able to predict foreign currency appreciation depreciation in my opinion those programs are complete garbage imagine there are people and huge companies that specialize in trading currencies for their own portfolios that risk million dollars to make a mere in one day but that could also be a loss of or much more also they have much better understanding than a lowly investor such as you or me therefore they will more often be on the winning side of a currency trade thus putting you on the losing end you want advice if you are interested in investing some money forex is not the place to begin as a beginner i would invest in mutual funds or individual stocks with solid fundamentals fundamentals you ask if you don't know what fundamentals are to a stock then that says you don't have much experience go for mutual funds  Foreign exchange market Mutual fund Bond Asian financial crisis Short selling Hedge fund Exchange rate Arbitrage United States dollar Economy of Russia Investment bank Bretton Woods system PE ratio Insurance Gold as an investment Financial markets Euro Microeconomics Corporate finance Ponzi scheme Monetary policy Mad Money Venture capital Derivative (finance) Citigroup Closed-end fund Equity investment Capital asset pricing model Security (finance) Stock market index Economy of India Stock Supply-side economics Institutional fund management Software patent debate Income trust Hyperinflation Corporation Enron Corporation Keynesian economics George Soros Eugene Fama Investment Capitalism Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Financial services Warren Buffett Modern portfolio theory Chartered Financial Analyst Gold standard Exchange-traded fund Intellectual property Goldman Sachs Pound sterling Economy of Chile Mergers and acquisitions Behavioral finance Temasek Holdings Interest Privatization Deflation (economics) John Maynard Keynes Japan-United States relations Government debt Day trading Microcredit Economy of Nigeria Monetarism Toronto-Dominion Bank Marshall Plan Free trade Economy of Argentina Fiat money Inflation Stock broker Wall Street Crash of 1929 Economy of South Africa Economy of Venezuela Technical analysis Renminbi American International Group Argentine Currency Board Eliot Spitzer Supply and demand Speculation Lehman Brothers Economy of Pakistan Economy of Kuwait Long-Term Capital Management Yield curve Money Anarcho-capitalism

what is the fastest way to raise your credit score my husband and i hit a financial hard spot about a year ago since then we have worked hard to catch up on all our bills and pay them on time we would like to buy a house in about years we own a condo at the moment would years be long enough to raise our credit scores other than paying our bills and paying off some of the balances that we owe is there another way to raise our credit scores we plan on keeping our credit cards once we get them paid off because we were told that as long as we charge something once a month and then pay that off every month it will help with our credit score any other advice the best advice i can give is to pay off your current debt and don't borrow any more money paying your bills on time for years and a good steady job are worth far more than continuing to borrow money also don't buy a house until you have a down payment so that you will not have to pay the mortgage insurance so with a good steady job no debt bills paid on time and down you shouldn't have a difficult time getting a home loan the problem with continuing to borrow money to raise your credit score is that as you have already experienced life happens financial hard spots occur if you keep adding to your debt when those hard spots pop up you have that much more to worry about if you can get on a budget and stay out of debt life will be so much simpler and less stressful since my wife and i followed those steps we have had a much easier time even with some severe problems in life we would be in serious jeopardy if we had debt other than our house i'm not sure if this is the kind of advice you were looking for but it's the best i can give to help you lead a financially healthy life  Mortgage Bond Money Debt Student loan Credit card Personal finance Great Depression Deflation (economics) Life insurance Economy of Russia Credit score Interest Insurance Finance Unemployment Hyperinflation Economy of the United States Asian financial crisis Social Security (United States) Security (finance) Short selling U.S. public debt FairTax Inflation Primerica Financial Services Economy of Pakistan Microeconomics Donald Trump Predatory lending Fiat money Health insurance Bank Social Credit History of the United States (1918-1945) EastEnders Economy of India Gold standard United Kingdom corporation tax Deficit spending Capital accumulation Derivative (finance) Islamic banking Mergers and acquisitions Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Citigroup Tax Mutual fund Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Financial markets Babe Ruth Euro Stock Schabir Shaik Trial Debt consolidation Surveillance Charles Ponzi Leeds United F.C.

what exactly is a hedge fund and is it better than index funds my dad has a couple mil but says hedge fund is a horrible idea because of high commissions and he says that ironically index funds actually outperform these hedges can someone translate that into english and explain the difference which one is better and if my dad is right i believe hedge funds bet against the market and invest in all assets beyond stocks and bonds typically hedge funds are for the extremely rich and require lots of money to get into jim cramer says that about one hundred people from the largest hedge funds and mutual funds basical control the market by deciding where and when to by diffrent investments due to index funds low expense fees it's a better long term bet for the comon investor index funds bascally are like buying the market rather than actively managed funds that try to out perform the market most managed funds will not out perform the market and have costly expense fees i recomend keeping the most of your asssets in an index fund such as vanguards s p index fund hope this made sence to you  Mutual fund Hedge fund Institutional fund management Index fund Short selling Insurance Passive management Stock market Financial services Finance Bond Investment bank Arbitrage Gold as an investment Corporate finance Stock market index Long-Term Capital Management The Vanguard Group Individual Savings Account Bank Microeconomics Security (finance) Dot-com Social Security debate (United States) Mortgage Corporation Asian financial crisis Financial markets Mergers and acquisitions S&P 500 Closed-end fund Hedge (finance) Collateralized debt obligation Publicly funded medicine Annuity Capital accumulation Equity investment Asset Temasek Holdings Debt Foreign exchange market Monetary policy Morgan Stanley Craps Income trust Inflation Eugene Fama Citigroup Gross domestic product Futures contract Short (finance) Private equity Supply-side economics Poker jargon Asset management Federal Reserve Federal National Mortgage Association Commodity markets Mad Money Capital asset pricing model Microsoft Lloyd's of London Mutual-fund scandal (2003) Wall Street Crash of 1929 Capitalism Hyperinflation Economics James Cramer Wal-Mart NASDAQ Efficient market hypothesis Economy of Russia MMORPG Real estate economics Active management Supply and demand Modern portfolio theory CPU cache Primerica Financial Services Ponzi scheme Stock broker Money supply Airline Bretton Woods system Speculation Pound sterling Investment Political economy Eliot Spitzer Graduate school Michael Milken

utility bills does anyone have this problem of paying more than what was initially agreed to pay on utility bills and when u call an agent to solve why u r being charged more you end getting confused by their explanation for instance initially i was told that my charter monthly payment would be but now i am paying more than a month for my energy service i feel like i am being ripped off every month on their statement i get all these lists of payment bill details which confuses me and ends up with no argument when talking to an agent as for the cell service it always feels like the minutes run out so quikly that i am forced to buy more minutes to fulfill my needs all these utility companies are rip offs do u agree by the way i use charter communication txu energy and t mobile charter cable sounds like you had a special offer that expired and are now paying full price the bill should detail exactly what service you have sounds like you have digital cable and internet service you can downgrade to cheaper service slower internet and fewer channels you can save on your cell phone by getting a plan with more minutes and or learning more self discipline and not hang on the phone so much by the way i don't consider either of these utilities my definition of utilities are the gas electric water sewer and trash collection  Virgin Mobile Telephone Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Microeconomics GSM services Short message service AT&T Enron Corporation Telephone numbering plan Bluetooth Credit card Voice over IP Toyota Prius Mortgage Telephone tapping Timeline of the Enron scandal Autonomous building ITV Plame affair United Kingdom corporation tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Computer Radio Solar power Mensal__o scandal BBC Surveillance Fuel cell Game programmer North American Numbering Plan Grid energy storage Nuclear power phase-out Federal Communications Commission Verizon Wireless Temasek Holdings America Online Filling station Monetary policy Laserdisc Hydrogen economy Opera (web browser) Manitoba Hydro Solar cell Capitalism Universal Serial Bus United Airlines Flight 93 Battery electric vehicle Electronic commerce Customer relationship management TiVo Stock Battery (electricity) Publicly funded medicine Internet 9-1-1 VeriSign Octopus card Eircom Privatization UK telephone numbering plan USA PATRIOT Act Technology Gmail Global System for Mobile Communications Skype Bond Cruising (maritime) Money Floppy disk General Packet Radio Service Annuity Electrophysiology Telephone exchange Karaoke Japanese mobile phone culture EasyGroup Monopoly (game) George W.
