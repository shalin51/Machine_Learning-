if you had a choice between these two which would you choose i have four months to get more training in something so that i can move my family out of our current situation my two choices are media design technology and accounting both will get me a certificate of completion accounting is simply accounting media design technology includes illustrator indesign publisher pagemaker quarkxpress photoshop director php premiere after effects flash xml vb net ado net c cgi perl java jsp and coldfusion mx which would you do i want to be able to work from home for a second income because i want to move to a smaller community and not have to rely on their economy i have to add that i have a ba but cannot find work in my area with it go with accounting your job choices later will be much greater and more diverse every company needs an accountant even if it is only the sole proprietor doing the bookwork i worked at a large fortune company and there were more accounting degrees than it degrees or information technology as they called it back then even tiny businesses need an accountant and you could easily buy software quickbooks tax prep etc to start doing side work for various people in your off time you could work from home as a bookkeeper just as easily as a media design expert i doubt every company needs a media design expert but worse than that you would have to continuously keep abreast of technology as it changes far more than accounting you would be spending extra time keeping current go with accounting easier to get a job in accounting easier to get side jobs in your spare time and the best of all you could be an accountant in a company that specializes in media design that way you would learn more about media design while having the security of the accounting position  PHP Ajax (programming) Web design JavaServer Pages Gross domestic product Accountancy Adobe InDesign QuarkXPress Outsourcing XML Java programming language Sun Microsystems Perl Software engineering Object-SQL mapping Graphic design Blog Apple Macintosh Intuit, Inc.

how many jobs have you gone through before you found one that was meant for you i'm in my mid twenties and am having a hard time finding a job i enjoy the longest job i've had was for years about years ago i've done all different kinds of work and probably had about jobs in the past years is this normal to not know what you want to do yet i already graduated from college please share your experiences i am now and was like you at that age i still seek to find the work that pleases me most i think that some of us were born to be discontent with working for others in general maybe you need to find something that interests you and pursue a way to make it profitable for you personally for instance if you are into make up and are a social creature maybe mary kay is a way to go they have a good plan and it pays of sales revenue plus bonuses and downline sales residuals or maybe you have just had bad luck finding a nurturing environment for your skills and motivations i am yo and have had over jobs in my working career since age plus side work for myself the longest job i have had has been about months most were months i found a great job in broadcasting that i really enjoyed the work was easy and i loved it the people and the work place was advanced and caring everything was rosy until my father got cancer and died through family issues selling the house and moving away from the area i gave up that job but i didn't realize how good it was until i had other experience to reflect upon later now i am floundering trying to find my place again part of my problem has been poor compensation it was hand to mouth wages for exhausting or demeaning work or conditions it makes it hard when your boss is driving a mercedes lives in a new house paid for buys a limited edition harley and then complains that you are poorly motivated but won't give a lousy dollar hour raise yeah spread the wealth at least let me make enough to pay my bills and eat more than beans and rice this is why i am trying to work for myself the people that prosper usually have something of their own that makes them money besides their 'day job' this creates wealth aside from the bread and butter job that pays the bills the sideline should be something that you enjoy something that you excel at or have had success doing and can be done profitably on a part time basis at first you might try counseling from professional career counselors at your state employment agency local university or your alma mater probably has placement assistance that provide skill assessment testing employment outlook information or at least a jobs board that can help you find something suitable if you can't find that one thing that inspires you do like i did start trying things even on a whim to see if you enjoy it get inside the industry even at entry level and research the people in the organization to see how they advanced or how they enjoy what they do what do you have to lose ask pry if you dont' like it find a new job and move on no love lost no broken dreams just good solid learning and experience eliminate the things you can't do won't do or have no interest in then see what is left then reassess your willingness number one thing to remember is that your satisfaction is priority one you will never be satisfied with anything nor successful with anything you do if you are not involved and invested mind body soul and spirit find your true passion like working with children or the sick or finance or music or travel then find a way to make that passion earn 'some' money it doesn't have to be great pay or even good pay but something coming in as you grow in the field it will grow to fit your needs i would rather work my entire life for free doing something i love than to be wealthy and do something i can't look myself in the face for doing god has a special plan for your life and he is calling you to it be still be true to your self and who god made you to be and dive deeply into that with trust in god and with a hope that goes beyond what you can see or even understand god will do the rest have faith your waiting and struggles will be rewarded manifold world peace

how to make a professiional resume i am a mca student fresher i dont know the perfect model of professional resume can anyone say or give the model of resume atleast layout a resume is a concise summary of all the information about us education work experience achievements and other personal details that will interest an employer although our prospective employer will read our cover letter before our resume the letter will just highlight a few of the many facts that we include in a well organized resume anticipate the keywords an employer will attach to the position you seek by keeping a log of words taken from help wanted ads and other sources electronic resume software programs search for job titles departments degrees universities attended companies worked for and the organization you belong to try to use the keywords as often as possible without overburdening your resume with them there is a fairly standard form for detailing information about ourselves and employers expect us to submit it in a recognizable way the following sections discuss the possible content and manner of presentation for our resume heading resumes are usually headed with our name address and telephone number this information may either be centered at the top of the page or placed in the top left hand corner career goal our career goal which follows our personal identification is one entry that every employer is interested in we must be specific as we can listing our immediate goal and not some vague future dream job position being applied for we must specify the position we are applying for examples systems analyst account executive securities analyst etc this position must be related to our career goal education and training this major section should state the most important qualifications we can offer for the job we are applying for if it is work experience that section should come next if it is our educational background that is more important place it first in either case we must tailor our qualifications to fit the job requirements this does not mean however that we are to falsify the information we provide it simply means that we are to pick out those qualifications that have the most direct relationship to the job for which we are applying for example suppose we are applying for the position of market researcher the person who reads our resume will not be interested in finding out that we had taken courses in baking orchid raising or canteen operation they will not also be interested in learning that we have worked as a teller in a bank but this person will be interested in reading about our experience in research or if our educational background is in mathematics statistics etc and if we had taken a speed reading course the most common way to describe our education is to list any university college or vocational school we have attended with the dates of attendance and any diplomas or certificates we have obtained we always place our most recent educational experience at the top of the list and work back from there if we want to stress our education we may want to include our major field of study and the names of significant courses which we have completed we may also want to list any honors or awards we have received a prospective employer is looking for evidence of leadership potential social poise and interest in a broad enough range of activities to make us an interesting person therefore we could list our extra curricular activities in which we had taken part and list down the positions we held in campus or school organizations work experience there are two acceptable ways of presenting our work background the most common is to list our jobs in chronological order with the present or the most recent one heading the list with such an arrangement the prospective employer can readily detect our progress or promotions if we use this format we should show the following a position held b name and location of company c date the position was held d achievement in the position e reason for leaving in addition we can strengthen our presentation by including the following a duties emphasize responsibilities b name of immediate superior if the person is still there and might be a good reference c job title e g systems analyst field sales manager etc if on the other hand our experience is scattered or we have done a lot of volunteer activities or if our employment history is spotty a functional resume can turn unrelated activities into a coherent business background when we use this format our experience is listed under descriptive categories in this way a wide variety of activities paid or volunteer interspersed with inactive periods can be presented to our advantage personal details personal data include gender age date and place of birth race religion optional marital status including number of children health height weight interests and hobbies references applicants for a job are usually requested to give the names of at least three persons who can be asked or called to speak about us the most appropriate persons include present or former employers teachers and other professionals also acceptable is a character reference whose name or occupation is respected if we include references in our resume we must give each individual's name title organization if any address and telephone number if we choose to provide the prospective employer with references at the time of the interview we make the following notation on our resume references will be supplied upon request in either case we must ask permission from the person before including his her name as reference the completed resume finally our completed resume must be concise well organized and easy to read the length should be one page or two pages at most after all we are summarizing our most important qualifications for a particular job not telling the story of our life appearance too is a very important factor to the over all presentation of our resume we must be careful not to overcrowd or spread out the information on a page we should also have our resume carefully typed or printed single space on x good quality white bond paper one which is handwritten or full of poorly made corrections will probably not be read at all honesty is a very important factor in a resume phony degrees or schools will be discovered we should not also exaggerate our accomplishments our resume should show progress advancement and ambition a good resume must get us at least an interview for an in depth study on resume writing and to give you an idea how it looks please go to these links and type in the search words how to write a resume ms word also has a resume template which you can follow http

can anyone give tips on making the perfect resume should i make it impressive and elaborate or simple and direct to the point besides setting all margins to the most important criteria for setting up a professional typed resume besides relevant text is scanability here are some helpful tips place just below your identification header your hame address phone email address any conditional warning statement such as confidential resume do not contact current employer etc always fill in an objectives category just below the conditional warning statement and make sure that he objective will contribute to the profitability of your future employer select a mono type font such as helvetica arial courier or times roman do not select any cursive handwriting styles which cannot scanned keep font sizes within a range of to pts avoid styling text with a justified alignment keep it flushed left instead of using tabs to set up blocked text entries generate a table and use the column and row settings accordingly do not place an i d picture anywhere on the resume this is a major taboo due to discrimination issues do not place any graphic text saved as gifs onto the resume since it may be overlooked during the scanning phase list at the very end of the resume your interests which should include travel experiences language skills social interactions such as golf team sports tennis etc in conclusion the above helpful hints were designed to allow ease of scanning of your resume into pdf which can then be text captured for seach purposes by your potential employer if the original resume was created in word wordperfect or mac appleworks it can be saved as a pdf file which then can be saved as an email attachment otherwise you can simply use a scanner and scan a hard copy of the resume and then save as a pdf file failure to conform the resume to appropriate fonts and styles as outlined above will result in rejection of the resume simply due to the inability of the scanning device to properly index relevant resume entries good luck  Typeface Killian documents EIA-708 Portable Document Format TrueType Gmail CPU cache HTML element Unicode Computer virus OpenDocument Apple typography C programming language PostScript Ebook WordPerfect ALGOL 68 Windows 2000 HTML Enterprise content management ASCII art Python programming language Virtual memory Opera (web browser) Cyrillic alphabet E-mail PNG Screenshot Computer Cascading Style Sheets Magnetic resonance imaging Stopping e-mail abuse Plame affair Perl Atari 8-bit family IPod British national identity card Windows Vista Forth programming language Pretty Good Privacy Anonymous remailer Macromedia Flash System/36 File Allocation Table Objective-C Typewriter Compiler optimization Volleyball Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Geographic information system System/34 Hangul Icon programming language Phishing Mach kernel QuickDraw GX Shogi File format Digital photography Screenwriting Intelligent design movement Mouse (computing) Euro Pointer HyperCard Palanca Awards Microsoft Blog REBOL Unicode and HTML Stuttering Tennis Hello world program Universal Serial Bus Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Control character Optical character recognition Dot matrix printer SCO-Linux controversies Insurance Visual Basic Computer forensics Microeconomics Voynich manuscript MIME Apple Computer Chinese character

i am looking for a training to get a job with good money making i was thinking of computer related career like computer programing or repair or web design what do you think or is there any other career that makes good money i decided i don't want the medical field i live in a small town and to personal and no jobs i would like something that i can get to go into my own business if possible thanks you iln advance if you are in a small town good luck the better technology careers are in larger cities start by looking at the jobs that are available in your area then decide or don't make money your primary search item just looking for a job where you make good money doesn't help you find something you are good at and computers and technology are things that either you are good at or you are not you generally don't learn it well and won't make good money consulting is a good money making career but it takes experience you can do that in any area so find what you like and do that you will be much happier inthe long run  Software engineering Computer W.

computer related degrees can someone give advice between two currently i am attending college for a computer degree i am in the intitial phase of classes and am thinking about changing the degree somewhat the current degree i am taking is computer information systems and i am starting to struggle with the amount of programming involved although i could probably push myself through it with lower gpa so what i am considering is the computer network administration degree however i'm worried that a network admin degree may somewhat limit my job qualification in the field is this a somewhat accurate asumption would i be making a sacrifice possibly pay wise by choosing this degree i would love to hear advice from those with similar degrees and where your degree has taken you my advice to you is to go for any computer degree these days employers do not care what type of computer degree you have as long as you have one you can easily enter any career you want it's all about the knowledge aptitude and experience i personally have a b s in computer science this degree allows me to get any technical job i have been a technical writer i t support tech trainer tech writer web developer i also wouldn't worry about gpa as long as you pass it's a misnomer that employers care about your gpa for your interest i would stick to a computer field that interests you there is no point in learning something that you are not interested in cis and cna is not going to affect your salary all technical jobs pay well unless you are planning on making six figures any technical degree will do programming is more versatile than network administration you can program in the video game web applications desktop applications it's pretty much endless  Grade (education) Education in Germany Game programmer Expert system Master's degree Education in Portugal IBM PC compatible Graduate school Password College admissions Medical school X Window System Management information system Academia Windows 2000 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Lawyer Nurse Georgia Institute of Technology Mach kernel Software engineering Education in the United States Open access Hacker Economic inequality Paralegal Electrical engineering Computer virus Pretty Good Privacy Inheritance (computer science) Psychology Mac OS X Middle Tennessee State University Bluetooth Education in Romania Common Unix Printing System Surveillance Backgammon Education Stevens Institute of Technology Software testing Internet Apprenticeship University of Michigan Apple Computer Cooperative education OpenGL Education in Hong Kong Outsourcing Education in Japan Electric motor Computer-supported collaboration Global Positioning System College Musical Instrument Digital Interface Physician Apple Macintosh Digital photography Whois Windows XP Health insurance Logic 2channel Embedded system Professor PostScript Amateur radio Mouse (computing) Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Redundant array of independent disks Enterprise content management Central processing unit Extreme Programming Computer science Stereoscopy Public policy No Child Left Behind Act Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Law school MMORPG Second language acquisition Education in Australia Futures Studies Grid computing Chiropractic Student loan Computer role-playing game The Citadel (Military College) Linux

is it illegal for employers to ask for experience my sister said she tried to put an advert out for an experienced stylist for her salon but was told its illegal to ask for experience as its discrimination i am looking for an it career for the first time and the vast majoirty of jobs ask for experience does this mean anything so basically they ask for experience if they are told not to they just wont hire anyone without experience anyways i have seen jobs in it at entry level in the last weeks of job searching the rest all require years experience or something which normal people cant experience unless your in a corporate environment to use the software to begin with so basically is it just best to apply for all possible jobs uk law in october the employment equality age regulations cam into force this law basically made it illegal to discriminate on the grounds of age both old and young in your sisters case for example putting in a job advert saying that you require applicants to have a certain amount of experience may be discrimination on the grounds of age because in short you are asking older people to apply i e an older person is more likely to have more experience than a younger person however there are circumstances when it is legal to discriminate but there has to be a 'genuine occupational requirement' goq for example an actor may have to be a certain age or it is justifiable to ask for more experience another example if you were looking for a manager to lead a team of people it may be justifiable to ask for applicants that have people management experience or degree educated but only if you feel that you can prove the job needs it if you have applied for a job but have been told that you do not have enough experience you can challenge the decision and ask the company how they have justified it whilst the age regs where well reported when they received royal assent and became law many companies have fallen into the trap of discriminating against employees and applicants in discrimination law you do not need to be an employee of a company in order to claim against it recruitment is a good example of this good luck  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Affirmative action Civil rights Trade union Economic inequality Appeal Equal Protection Clause European Convention on Human Rights Charter of the French Language Immigration to the United States Royal Assent Unlawful combatant Psychology Legal aspects of transsexualism Business ethics Same-sex marriage Australian constitutional law Wal-Mart Gay rights Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Corporate personhood Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Israeli Arab Apple Computer Judicial review Labour economics Life insurance Microeconomics Software engineering Microsoft Free trade Health insurance Workers' compensation Price discrimination Lawrence v.

when writing a thank you letter after an interview should it be typed or handwritten i know that handwritten seems more personable but to me it doesn't look very professional zoo b cool i can sincerely appreciate what you expressed on the comparison of hand written vs typed on the thank you note given the fact that these professionals interviewed you in person and may or may not be aware of other interviews you may or may not be attempting your typed thank you note may give the impression that it was generated automatically with countless others that you have interviewed with my suggestion i recommend the hand written note and thanks expressed to each of the individuals in the room if you can recall their names use first names only if you feel confident you scored high during the round of discussion if you are uncertain how your answers were interpreted then use mr ms etc i hope this helps and best of luck on the outcome sincerely gerry  A Course In Miracles Killian documents Social rule Charles Darwin's views on religion Tactical voting United States Postal Service Slow Train Coming Contract Quizbowl Autism Sharon Tate Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Polymorphism (computer science) Free will Mediation Scientology beliefs and practices Breastfeeding 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, exit polls Ra (board game) Professional wrestling Simon Commission Reparative therapy Plame affair Causality The Contender (television series) Transsexuality English grammar Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs XML Internet troll Milton H.

are there any jobs that are not full of disappointments it's a decently loaded question disappointment generally stems from expectations what you really need to ask yourself is what your expectations for your job and career are some job expectations are perfectly fair we expect to be treated with respect we expect to work on projects that are interesting and exciting to us we expect to like the people we work with and for finding a job where these expectations are nicely matched in reality isn't always easy but it's more than possible with enough work reach out into your personal network and find which of your friends and colleagues have jobs that fulfill them you'll find a few things in common with most people who like their jobs their employers are flexible and they tend to like and respect their coworkers look into working for organizations that foster these feelings on the other hand if your expectations are unreasonable you may find any job to be disappointing if you're expecting immediate autonomy or the ability to call the shots on major projects you may be disappointed when you find that these things take time to earn ultimately i think that this question is about attitude what can you change in your attitude that will let you find the job that satisfies you  Theory of conduct Social rule Goodness and value theory Economic inequality Ethics Graduate school Infantilism Government of India Act 1935 Mach kernel Social psychology Religion Finnish Civil War Extreme Programming Coercion Objectivist philosophy Polyamory Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Charles Grandison Finney Software engineering Gender role Alex Ferguson Professor The Smoking Room Gender-neutral language Shaggy dog story Strategic management Universal pragmatics Labour economics Hospitality service Microeconomics Honey and Clover Coming of Age (TNG episode) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Reality New York Jets Capitalism George Costanza Baseball Richard Feynman Employment W.
