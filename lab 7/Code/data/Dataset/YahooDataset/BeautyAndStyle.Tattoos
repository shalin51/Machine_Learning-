what does anybody know bout tatto removal how much does it cost how well does it work and anything else methods of tattoo removal there are several excellent methods of tattoo removal available today the method that the physician chooses will depend upon the size of the tattoo and its location as well as the length of time it has been on the skin how the patient heals may also be a factor in the decision excision another popular method of tattoo removal especially when the dyed area is small is by excision the advantage of this method is that the entire tattoo can be removed with larger tattoos however it may be necessary to excise in stages removing the center of it initially and the sides at a later date excision involves an injection of a local anesthetic to numb the area after which the tattoo is removed surgically the edges are then brought together and sutured with this procedure there is minimal bleeding which is easily controlled with electrocautery in some cases involving large tattoos a skin graft taken from another part of the body may be necessary dermabrasion another method of tattoo removal is called dermabrasion in which a small portion of the tattoo is sprayed with a solution that freezes the area the tattoo is then sanded with a rotary abrasive instrument causing the skin to peel because some bleeding is likely to occur a dressing is immediately applied to the area laser in recent times many physicians consider laser surgery one of the best methods of tattoo removal today the q switched nd yag q switched alexandrite and the q switched ruby are among the most frequently used lasers today for the removal of unwanted tattoos they are all employed in a similar manner if necessary a cream to numb the skin can be applied prior to the treatment pulses of light from the laser are directed onto the tattoo breaking up the tattoo pigment over the next several weeks the body's scavenger cells remove the treated pigmented areas more then one treatment is usually necessary to remove all of the tattoo salabrasion salabrasion a procedure which is centuries old is a method still sometimes used today to remove tattoos as with the other methods a local anesthetic is used on and around the tattooed area after which a solution of ordinary tap water dipped in table salt is applied an abrading apparatus such as the one used with dermabrasion or an even simpler device such as a wooden block wrapped in gauze is used to vigorously abrade the area when the area becomes deep red in color a dressing is applied what results can be expected regardless of which method of tattoo removal is used some scarring or color variations are likely to remain healing time varies depending upon the size and depth of the tattoo the proce dure used and the patient's healing process it is important for the patient to discuss with the physician the various procedures how they are performed and the probable results care of the treated area must also be discussed how much does it cost getting a tattoo removed is much more expensive than having one put on laser tattoo removal can range from several hundred dollars up into the thousands of dollars depending upon the size type and location of the tattoo and the number of visits required medical insurance generally doesn't pay for tattoo removal since it is considered aesthetic or cosmetic in nature most amateur tattoos are removed in to treatments scheduled about weeks apart removing a professionally applied tattoo is usually a fading process that requires a series of treatments spaced approximately weeks apart or longer professional tattoos usually require treatments for complete clearing costs range between per session as an average http images google com images

why does the outline on a tattoo hurt the most i know they do this bit first usually but i still dont get why like a few people here have said it's like doing a drawing you can't colour a picture in until you've drawn it i thought the outline hurt the most on all mine but i think it also depends where you get it in the first place how much body fat you have etc i'm pretty skinny and i have one on my shoulder blade which didn't hurt a bit but then when i got the one done on my lower back it hurt a bit for the outline and then as someone else on here said your endorphins kick in and you don't feel it as much they are addictive and believe me is nothing compared to childbirth get one you'll be back for more i promise get yourself some numbing cream from the chemist my friend uses it for everything piercings tattoo etc and doesn't feel a thing wish i'd thought of that for mine but as i said not too bad pain wise  Nine Inch Nails Self-harm Theory of conduct Piccolo Junior Saga Equine conformation Jackass: The Movie Tattoo LSD Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Addiction Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Transactional analysis Swimming Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Shining (film) Drug addiction Vegeta Slayers Humphrey Bogart Professional wrestling holds Rich Mullins Breastfeeding Milton H.

tattoo myth why is it bad to have an even number of tattoos i think it is not about not having an even number of tattoos but specifically not having four so those with four tattoos are encouraged to get another making it five this likely stems from the number being resented by the chinese as the pronunciation of sounds like 'death' and death is regarded as bad luck this is why you can't order four cookies at a chinese bakery either  Tattoo Chinese character Pinyin Hangul Chinglish Standard Mandarin Cantonese (linguistics) Numerology Radical (Chinese character) Luck Chinese language Bulgarian language Japanese name Written Cantonese Girl Scout cookies Kanji Avril Lavigne International Phonetic Alphabet Writing system Chinese New Year Hip hop rivalries Non-native pronunciations of English Fortune cookie Diacritic Korean language Chinese surname Japanese writing system Speech synthesis Swastika Latin alphabet Standard Cantonese Irezumi Chiang Kai-shek Sook Ching massacre Classical Chinese Tears for Fears Japanese calendar Hanja Taiwanese aborigines Languages of Hong Kong Bruce Dickinson Mahjong Waterworld Mandarin (linguistics) Chinese calendar Meme Racism American and British English differences Bagpipes Mara Salvatrucha Middle Chinese Cookie Kuan Yin Dictionary Deluge (mythology) Peanut Nichiren 13 (number) Hiragana Fred Rogers Dog Customs and etiquette of Japan Falun Gong Legal status of Taiwan Asian fetish Romanization Southern Athabascan languages Chinese character classification Angelina Jolie Scarification Tea Katakana Acupuncture Tennessee Williams Taiwanese (linguistics) Bamboo Tattoo You Portuguese language Anti-Semitism People's Republic of China Immigration to the United States Australian words Russian language Reiko Braille Chester Bennington Zhuyin Mao: The Unknown Story Cookie Monster Slovak language Tengwar Old English language Good Charlotte Body modification Amulet Wade-Giles Gaara Death By Stereo Eureka Stockade Chinese name

arizona people tattoo no parent helppp okay so my friend wants a tattoo dedicated to his cousin who recently passed away tomorrow is his birthday and i said i would help him try and get one if you don't live in arizona you probably won't be much help he's and wants to get it without his parents knowing does anyone know of any tattoo parlors that don't need parental consent or do underage tattoos please help me it's not like he's trying to be a badass it's for his cousin that he was really close to if you're a tattoo artist that lives in az and is willing to do it please answer thank you oh don't say anything about underage tatooing or stuff like that i already know ittt thanks okay first of all i think it's great that your friend wants to honor his cousin in that way i'm not going to say anything bad about underage tattooing i am simply going to tell you the facts you can not get a tattoo from a legitimate tattoo artist without parental concent untill you are it is illegal for them to do so and they could face major fines and or jail time for doing it if he gets one done from a person that will do it without concent there's a much bigger chance of something going wrong disease infection scarring personally i think that if your friend really wants to honor his cousin he can wait till he's then he'll really know if he wants it forever too if he's forgotten about it by then or doesn't want it when the time comes no harm done if he still wants it then he'll still be able to get it done that also leaves alot of time to think of and decide design what he wants to get  Tattoo Age of consent Child pornography Friends Abortion debate Good Times Shaggy dog story Scarification Theory of conduct Badly Drawn Kitties Adoption Mothers Against Drunk Driving Britney Spears Social rule Days of our Lives The Rock (entertainer) 2004 Republican National Convention Jon Secada Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Hepatitis C The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Ion Davidov One Piece minor characters Hip hop rivalries Smallville (Season 4) Trailer Park Boys YuYu Hakusho The Life and Times of Juniper Lee R.

is it possible to get a tattoo on the inside of your mouth ex bottom inner lip upper inner lip ex bottom inner lip upper inner lip the skin in front of your teeth if so does this harm you in any way yes it is possible it's also pretty much a waste of money since the inside of your mouth doesn't hold ink well at all a good artist will tell you the pro's and cons but it's a pretty good chance that your tissue is just going to push the color right back out one girl that came into the shop pushed her's out in less the hours no matter how good the artist is it's just not a great place to get one it's not harmful think about how much damage you do to the inside of your mouth when you bite your lip and how fast it heals the tissue that makes up your mouth is constantly and quickly regenerating which is one of the reasons for the push out rate  Tattoo Embouchure Bong Earring Scarification Drill bit Headcrab Tooth Gag (BDSM) Cleft Unreal Urinary incontinence Place of articulation The Legend of Zelda series enemies Equine conformation Internal ballistics Stem cell Traditional animation Body piercing Skin Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Poker jargon Healing Boom Town (Doctor Who) Swimming Professional wrestling holds Stopping power Wound healing phases Autonomic nervous system Menstrual cup Tooth enamel Erogenous zone Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Body modification Oral sex Herpes simplex virus Read my lips: no new taxes Vowel Pain Terminal ballistics Cosmetics Supply-side economics Action potential 2000 Australian Grand Prix Chopsticks Fugu Bladderwort Skateboarding trick Cancer Weight training Charmed GunBound Voiceless palatal-velar fricative Puberty Backstroke Mouthpiece Futari wa Pretty Cure Snake United States dollar Make money fast Naruto jutsu Sperm Whale Face Textile manufacturing Trapping Professional wrestling throws Dental caries Rugby union positions Defense of the Ancients Hangul Tasmanian Devil Energy development Breastfeeding Androgen insensitivity syndrome Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Microeconomics The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Fable (video game) Britney Spears Table tennis Electrophysiology The Suffering (game) Tuatara Dentures Team Fortress Classic Confidence trick Lip balm Vitamin C Horse tack Gaia Online Ulcer Cat Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders The Amazing Race Doom enemies Penis Vegeta Piccolo Junior Saga Kenny McCormick Drawing

tat idieas anyone can send me an image through email only designs not real tats best image gets best answer please include where put the tat any tat pink im a flirt funny and somewhat outgoing please send images to pandaox yahoo com okay the problem with soliciting tattoos through ya is that we don't really know you a tattoo is something sooo personal that it really needs to mean something to you and something you are willing to live with the rest of you life you should not be going for the cool factor because that disappears once you hit about or so grin and you are left explaining what the tattoo means to you once you've decided to get a tattoo i highly suggest waiting at least a year this is where you make a decision about what you want you can take suggestions from people who know you but ultimately it should be something you are willing to explain later on in life once you've picked a tat and a location then shop around for the best tat artist you can find and then go for it  Social rule Internet fraud Vanilla Ninja Tatting Jennifer Lopez Oh My Goddess!

am i doing the right aftercare of my tatoo i just got my first tattoo on the top of my back right below my neck my tattoo artist told me to keep the bandage on for two hours which i did and then wash it with antibacterial soup which i also did he told me to get a fragrance free lotion and apply to it i got aveeno daily moisturizing lotion fragrance free and i've been applying that two times daily even though it's kind of hard for me to reach it has been itching a little bit and it's also a little sore but i haven't bled at all and it's not infected am i applying lotion enough daily and are there any secrets to making it heal faster and stay looking good i got it done on friday the rd and i was told not to put neosporin on it because i might have an allergic reaction which will cause red bumps and when the red bumps go away i will have a spotted tattoo another thing haha how do i know when it's healed twice a day seems about right depending on your skin type what kind of air exposure it gets local humidity temperature etc a good rule of thumb is if the tattoo feels more or less like the uninked skin you're doing fine what you use is semi irrelevant and as long as you're sticking to what the artist recommends use the above as a general guideline you are correct in that neosporin other tribiotics should not be used for reasons you mention vaseline also not as it can pull out the color although i think this may only be a concern earlier within the first week or so everything else seems good don't worry about healing fast worry about healing right as far as staying looking good mostly it's a matter of taking care of your skin stay out of the sun use moisturizer if the skin is getting dry take general care of yourself that kind of thing i read a cnn article recently talking about how smoking ages the skin much like sun damage so if you smoke you may wish to rethink that side note antibacterial soup i know it's a typo but i needed the chuckle and thank you for inadvertently providing one addendum forgot to answer the last bit you know it's healed when the skin over the tattoo looks feels like the surrounding skin this can take up to three months but tends to be pretty close by weeks  Tattoo Body piercing Psoriasis Eczema Skin Urinary incontinence Social rule Diving suit Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Theory of conduct Scabies Stomach cancer Manicure Breastfeeding Radiation therapy Acne Shaving Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Milton H.

i was thinking about getting an inner lip tattoo does it ever fade does it ever fade is it true it hurts bad there because it's all fat and are you at higher risk for getting ink poisoning if you get it there well unfortunately you do get ink loss because tattoos should not be kept wet or soaked because the ink will have a tendancy to be lost sometimes the tattoo artists don't make it deep enough to stick the ink doesn't stay as much as it would on the arm or other body parts the skin on the inner lips is a bit more delicate than skin on the outside body also if you end up getting it stay away from sugar and booze they will suck the ink right out it doesnt last forever anyway though and if you want to keep it looking good get it touched up regularly and someone told me new skin grows over it so it looks like the color fades not sure if that's true or not also the process of an inner lip tattoo takes from minutes  Tattoo Scarification Breastfeeding Ink Hair Prostate cancer Irezumi Memento (film) Erogenous zone Traditional animation Vegeta Cape Feare Psoriasis Urinary incontinence Printmaking Body piercing Drill bit Drawing Earring The Shining (film) Puberty Cosmetics Snake Fugu Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Theory of conduct Avril Lavigne Hiking Kurt Angle The Death Gate Cycle Tofu Skin Body modification The Amber Spyglass Queen (band) Sin City Tokusatsu Dieting Herpes simplex virus Dragon Booster Tanning Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist First aid CMYK color model True Crime: Streets of LA Bleeding Comanche Bladderwort One Tree Hill (TV series) LSD M.C.

i need some ideas for a tattoo design if you're going to say don't get a tattoo don't answer this question because i already have one i'm wanting to get one for my grandpa who passed away in i saw one design that was a heart shaped apple with wings and you could put a banner across it i can't seem to find that design i was wanting an apple like design because his last name was appel any ideas would be great when i got my favourite tattoo i shopped around at lots of tattoo artists because i wanted something special and original don't forget that people that get into doing tattoos are artists they don't just transfer little pre made designs onto your skin a good tattoo artist will want to design you a great tattoo and will feel that it is important to get it right you can just describe what you want and usually in a few days they will have a few designs for you to pick from if they can't be bothered don't let them draw something indelible on your skin my favourite tattoo was inspired from a drawing in a tattoo artist's shop the tattooist had a habit of buying sketch books from local artists to get a range of different ideas and we just modified a design from one of those good luck  Tattoo Don Rosa The Adventures of Pete & Pete Irezumi Social rule Customs and etiquette of Japan Vanilla Ninja The Emancipation of Mimi Avril Lavigne Singlish Memento (film) Body modification Philosophy of language Supply and demand Clothing One Piece minor characters Current teachings of Prem Rawat Surveillance Discordianism Hiberno-English Kurt Cobain Amulet The Ashlee Simpson Show Little Britain Scarification Picts Kender Ontological argument Theory of conduct Extreme Programming IBM PC compatible Art Michelle Branch Leonardo da Vinci Alice's Adventures in Wonderland United Artists Economics Milton H.

where would be the best place for a girl to get a tattoo i mean on her body im not sure where i want it because i dont want a place where it will look bad when i get older to be honest with you thats something that would be up to you it's your body but i can tell you this i recently got a tattoo on my upper back right below that weird neck bone that sticks out anyways i got it there because if i'm out on the beach or something wearing a tank top or a bikini it's cute and visible but if i'm at work even though they don't care that i have a tattoo i can easily hide it with a t shirt or blouse but as everyone has warned it will be with you forever and it might not look the same when you get older so don't get something so detailed if you want it to be small the more detailed it is the bigger your tattoo is going to have to be in order for it not to blob together in the future and anyone who tells you they can do a detailed tattoo in a small size is just wanting to do it for money years from now when it's all blobbed together they're not going to care they got your money years ago  Tattoo Shirt Brassiere One Piece minor characters Bikini Comanche Undergarment Pitaten Earring Sin City Violin Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Characters of Naruto YuYu Hakusho The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Okashina Okashi Avril Lavigne Aerial (dance move) Conker's Bad Fur Day Characters in the Smurfs Vanilla Ninja Pok__mon Snap Namie Amuro Manhunt (video game) Angelina Jolie Debra Marshall Buttocks Double bass Equine conformation Homestar Runner The Legend of Zelda series enemies X-Men: Evolution The Who Sell Out Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Invader Zim Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Swimsuit Sperm Whale RuneScape quests Samurai Deeper Kyo Beachwear Dinosaur One Tree Hill (TV series) Pazyryk Scarification Unreal Tag Bob Jones University The Parting of the Ways Clothing Surveillance Jennifer Lopez Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Pok__mon Live!

when you go to the tatooist can you just bring a photo of someone elses tattoo and tell them thats what you want other than a stencil lol yes you can do that but it should be a clear bright picture and preferrably a close up so the artist is not guessing what it is however why would you want to get the same tat as someone else that is the beauty of getting a tat to have something that not everyone else is going to have be original think outside of your own brain  Tattoo Graffiti Screen-printing The Cure Bible code Jon Secada Photography Printmaking Liquid crystal display television Irezumi Autostereogram Academy Award for Best Picture Mimeograph machine The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Brett Whiteley Stereoscopy Banksy Airbrush 10cc Thomas Sankara PlayStation Portable The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Playing card Academy Award for Original Music Score Surrealist techniques Ghost in the Shell AFI 100 Years series Scarification Comanche Len Lye Mamie Van Doren Tattva Ernie Els Piet Mondrian Sharon Tate Wassily Kandinsky Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Vitreous enamel Thematic Apperception Test The Velvet Underground Ideogram Eric Cartman USA Network Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media Che Guevara Pornography Duplicating machines Columbia Pictures Melissa Manchester LOL (Internet slang) MOSFET Sento Biometrics Dyslexia Tatting Lol Coxhill Charles XIV John of Sweden Chilean coup of 1973 Clear Channel Communications As the World Turns JPEG Zahra Kazemi Lewis Carroll Gisele B__ndchen Mountain Jews Avril Lavigne Embassy Television Namie Amuro Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Carl Gustaf Pilo Magnetic resonance imaging Cabaret Francis Crick The Art of Noise Michelle Wie Foreign relations of Fiji Cour de cassation Cassini-Huygens French Revolution The Damned My Generation XIII (comic) The Price Is Right Charles Graner Eye Lenny Kravitz Kimono Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?

is there tattoo schools or classes is there schools that will teach you at least the basics in tattooing i have never met anyone who learned to tattoo this way but it sounds like a good idea if so does anyone have a list of tatttoo schools classes in california the above are good answers to add to them think of doing tattoo work as somewhat like graduate work you'll need to educate establish yourself as an artist before tattoos come into the mix the portfolio of work you'd present to a potential person you'd apprentice under is best built up during college level art classes it's kind of like how you take a pre med bio undergrad before you attend med school pre law or related before law school etc and so on once you've got the artistic bases covered then think about tattooing it's not something you can just jump into if you want to be respected accepted  Education in the United States Medical school Law school Master's degree New York University No Child Left Behind Act Education Homeschooling Education in the People's Republic of China GED Education in Australia Education in Romania Community college Regent University Juris Doctor Martial art Education in Japan Education in Germany Doctorate Boy Scouts of America College Columbia University Chinese University of Hong Kong Apprenticeship Art Education in Taiwan Education in Portugal Aesthetic Realism Education in France Education in Singapore Social justice Affirmative action Coeducation Air Education and Training Command Macquarie University Creation and evolution in public education Mixed martial arts Grade (education) Graduate school York University Ruth Bader Ginsburg Secondary education in Japan Lawyer Seton Hall University Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints London Metropolitan University Irezumi Florida State University Strategic management College admissions Warren Buffett Education reform Bob Jones University Tai Chi Chuan Giorgio Agamben High school Blended learning Education in Hong Kong Dog agility Rabbi Unreal Sudbury Valley School Advanced Placement Program Drama Chinese martial arts Experiential education School Philosophy of education Professor SAT Religious education Separation of church and state Independent school (UK) Robert Hutchins Theatre Japanese tea ceremony University of California, Los Angeles Johns Hopkins Hospital Swahili language Christian Brothers University Human sexual behavior Copyright law of the United Kingdom Harvard Division of Continuing Education Scarification John Rawls The College of New Jersey University of Szeged University of San Diego Picts United World Colleges Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Good Charlotte Bj__rk Boston University Education in Albania Wayne State University Management information system

does getting a tattoo hurt that bad i was thinking of getting my whole forearm tattooed when i turn which is pretty soon and i was just wondering how much does it really hurt my friends say its not that bad but i want to get other opinions i have tattoos and some areas for me were much more sensitive than others the most painful for me was the back of my calves skin is thinner there like butter as my artist would say wrist area and stomach for the same reason i barely felt my forearm front of calves back or neck being done however we all have different levels of pain tolerance the average person can sit comfortably for about hours before it becomes unbearable the worst for me was the anxiety of getting the first one  Milton H.

what would you call a tattoo that covers your whole stomach on one side is it a full body tattoo i want to know the catagory of a tattoo that starts below the hip and goes up above the breast but only on one side of the body what kind is that like obviously it's not a lower back tattoo but does it have a catagory or something i am not sure if it has a classification as to what it's called just tell the artist what you want and they can draw it out for you also just as fyi some studios charge more for tattoos on certain parts of the body because they are more painful for the client and more difficult for the artist to tattoo like i said just ask your artist and they will be happy to help you out  Tattoo Irezumi Namie Amuro Professional wrestling holds Chester Bennington Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Professional wrestling throws Drew Barrymore Mattress Butterfly stroke Abdomen Body modification Scarification Aerial (dance move) Criminal tattoo Acupuncture Professional wrestling attacks Avril Lavigne Self-harm Equine conformation Breaststroke Angelina Jolie Homunculi of Fullmetal Alchemist Massage Music genre Tattoo You Prostate cancer Human anatomy Picts Backstroke Nine Inch Nails Live At Leeds Brassiere Jackass: The Movie Pop music Brandy (entertainer) Britney Spears Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Hogtie bondage Undergarment M__tley Cr__e Earring Sento Hip fracture Rayden Michelle Branch Dead Like Me Elbow bondage Medical astrology Pazyryk Marvin Gaye Body art Tocopherol Comanche Breastfeeding Corset Breast Horizontal bar Hepatitis C The Wildhearts Badly Drawn Kitties Call girl Traumatic incident reduction Glossary of partner dance terms Johnny Tapia Bj__rk YuYu Hakusho Seppuku Front crawl Ayumi Hamasaki Tightlacing Body painting Good Charlotte Sari Request for Comments Lawyer Brett Whiteley Stomach R.

my mother says i can get a tattoo my mother has a agreed to letting me get a tattoo for my birthday actualy she sudgested it o i was just wondering im and im getting it on the side of my calf i know it might hurt there and all but what i wanna know is will it stretch or anything as i get older bigger and if it does can it be fixed up too look better depending on where you live it may or may not be legal anyway so check the laws before you get set on getting one second you are only likely to grow some more and it's better to wait until you are done growing to get tattoos over muscle masses avoid having to have it fixed wait two or three years to confirm that you really want it and then get it seriously if you wait a little bit your taste and body will change let yourself mature some before you do something permanent time is good when considering tattoos try getting a henna or a piercing if you really want some kind of body modification  Body modification Weight training Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milton H.

why won't some tattoo parlors tattoo directly below the ankle bone i am trying to get a tattoo in the little spot just below the ankle inside above the arch of the foot and the heel i have one on my right ankle that was done about years ago and now want one on my left ankle i have spoken with a few different shops and they all say that it is shop policy not to do a tattoo in this spot on the body something about the color lasting in this spot because of natural exfoliation the tattoo that i want is small and does not have a lot of detail so i am confused as to why they won't do it especially when my other one is still as colorful and bright as the day it was done can anyone offer me any ideas of why they won't do it all said they can do it above the ankle bone which is less than inches away from where i want it or on top of the foot neither location is an option for me thoughts thanks for your help i'm not sure i can offer any new information other than that it is a spot on your body where you go through skin really fast exfoliation tattoo artists are generally a lot less willing to do a tattoo if it is going to look really bad in a few years they like to be able to stand behind their work i'd say your best bet is to either look for a new location for the tattoo if you really want it to last and be crisp and not blurry or try to convince one of the artists that that's really what you want and you don't care if it looks crummy later good luck  Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation Aerial (dance move) Horse Shoe Kurt Angle Customs and etiquette of Japan Volleyball Brian Close Irish dance Avril Lavigne Opportunity rover Foot Fable (video game) Fancy rat Comanche Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Sento Scarification Psoriasis Stereoscopy Anatomical terms of location Achilles' tendon Poker jargon Memento (film) Dragon Booster Billboard Hot 100 Dodge Charger Vanilla Ninja Yosemite National Park Unreal Glossary of partner dance terms Glossary of ballet terms Jessica Lynch Cheating in poker Pterosaur Diving suit Gaia Online Massage Crucifixion Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma San Andreas (state) Basketball Craps Mark Calaway Human anatomy Pain Dominoes The Dalek Invasion of Earth Mid-levels Professional wrestling slang Columbine High School massacre Akatsuki (Naruto) Dallas, Texas High-heeled shoe Physical characteristics of the Buddha The Rock (entertainer) Blackjack Decompression sickness Minor characters in Morrowind The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Body painting Skateboarding trick Body modification Pittsburgh Steelers Irezumi About a Boy Dinosaur Acne Social rule Marching band Good Charlotte Proprioception Shawn Michaels Waterworld Anatomical position Henna The Apprentice 2 Andr__ the Giant Angelina Jolie Crocodilia Hip hop rivalries 613 mitzvot Homunculi of Fullmetal Alchemist Swingout Platypus Flat feet $ale of the Century Brassiere Australian cricket team Chris Jericho Manhunt (video game) Leopard Sunlight Human skin color The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Badly Drawn Kitties Norway national football team 1957 World Series

work wanted how do you train to be a tatoo artist it's a fairly tough path but the best seems to draw a lot build up a good portfolio the bigger more diverse the better hopefully you have talent as an artist and branching out into other areas painting etc doesn't hurt aim for at least a few college level courses in art or a ba mfa if you can manage it this might be concurrent with look for a legitimate artist to apprentice under you'll probably need to hunt around a bit and likely go through an interview like process even when if they take you on you'll get lots of grunt level work at least to start like cleaning work areas handling the register dealing with oddballs who come in the front door etc best of luck to you this is a non trivial way to go about it but it seems like the one most artists prefer and will result in respect from the community definitely do not just buy a machine off of ebay and practice on grapefruit or something equally appalling that would pretty much kill your chances with any legit folks  Professional wrestling slang 2000 Australian Grand Prix Theory of conduct Poker jargon Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Tattoo Social rule Product Lifecycle Management Extreme Programming CPU cache Drew Struzan Microeconomics Piccolo Junior Saga Diving Diversity Halo: Combat Evolved RuneScape quests Art Dog agility Game show CDC 6600 Knife RuneScape Internet fraud Academic art W.

how painful is a tattoo i knowit's gonna hurt loads also i've heard it hurts more in different places so out of the wrist the top of my foot and my back which is more painful and how painful can you compare it to anything there are many factors that influence the amount of pain involved in getting tattooed the size and placement of the tattoo are considerations but also the person doing the tattoo the larger the piece of artwork you want the longer you will spend getting tatttooed of course leading to more pain the placement of the artwork on your body is also a key factor places like the outside of your upper arm calf are much less painful than places like the inside of your upper arm top of feet one factor that is often overlooked by a person looking to get a tattoo is the artist doing the work some tatttooists are very heavy handed but only go over each line once or twice and some are very light handed but go over every line a million times if i ever find one with a light hand that only goes over each line a couple times i'll let ya know the placement of the tattoo on your body will also play a determining factor in how much pain you will be in during the healing process the tattoos on my arms neck were much more easily healed than the tattoos on my feet in my bikini area the tattoos that are subject to clothing shoes rubbing on them are much harder to keep clean and more likely to scab i cannot accurately describe the way it feels to get a tattoo i have experienced a different sensation with just about every one all pain sensations however the best thing i can say is that it starts out like an annoying pain bee sting or sandpaper but will progress with time irritation to a more substantial pain the skin will swell bleed so the longer it takes the more it will feel like you are rubbing sandpaper on a real bad sunburn i have too many tattoos to count and they were all well worth the pain i went through to get them they do not hurt everyday for the rest of your life suck it up and get inked have fun good luck  Tattoo Scarification Diving Professional wrestling holds Weight training Carpal tunnel syndrome Pain Milton H.

piercing cartilage these are the things i have peroxide alchohol cottonballs a thick needle earing stud potato paper towls sharpie my question is how do i mark and now where to put the earing and like if you have a link to a how to plz give it to me and going to a shop is not an option plz and thnx best answer gets points i think you should not use a needle just use an earing because it hurts less but it is recomended to use a needle sterilize your ear and equipment using an autoclave is the only way to have absolutely sterile materials you must know how to set up a sterile field to work in and be able to prevent cross contamination between sterile and non sterile items make sure to not use ice on your ear as it will only harden the surface and make the piercing process hurt more than neccessary take the needle and pop it through the first layer of skin tilt the needle at the angle you want the stud to be at and pop it the rest of the way through use a cotton ball or something else that will be able to stop the needle from going in your head but won't be a nuisance leave the needle in for a moment it should barely break the back surface of your ear farther is fine but not necessary place the jewelry into the hollow back of the needle and follow it through the hole enjoy it takes months to completely heal wash with anti bacterial soap and use sea salt soaks twice a day never use any kind of piercing gun or anything other than a piercing needle the reason for that is that any blunt force on your cartilage can easily break up the cartilage in your ear which will cause it to change or possibly lose its' shape  Earring Tattoo Ear piercing instrument Knife Sterilization (microbiology) Agar plate Intravenous therapy Acupuncture Terminal ballistics Bacteria Menstrual cup Drill bit Welding Bone Opportunity rover Brewery Archery Barbell (piercing) Swimming Eye Cartilage Dairy Wound Sundial Equine conformation Pottery Manicure Sternum Ice core Scapula Wire Violin Shroud of Turin Upholstery Mattress Knitting Lip piercing Tire VHF omnidirectional range 1957 World Series Social rule Prince Albert piercing Naval mine Nuclear weapon design Blood (computer game) Occipital bone Naruto jutsu Thermal power station Autoclave Ear Final Fantasy magic Suture Glacier Acne Dialysis Sphenoid bone Iron Glass Mouse (computing) Tooth enamel Ammolite Ozone depletion Tofu Nine Inch Nails Table tennis Skateboarding trick Ultraviolet Sex toy Electrophysiology Water (molecule) Skin Hepatitis C Sea ice Hygiene Black hole Handloading Soap Play piercing Ozone hole Methamphetamine Laws of cricket Timpani Fast bowling Strap-on dildo Potato Comfrey Neon Genesis Evangelion glossary

is it possible to get a temporary semi permanent tattoo that will last no longer than years i want to get a tattoo down the back of my neck but don't want to stuck with the commitment of a permanent one on the other hand although the henna tattoos look great for about a week they start to wash out afterwards so it's not an option i saw a tattooist who told me there's no such thing as a semipermanent tattoo if i get one done by any of those who claim to be able to do it there's no guarantee of how long it'll last or if it'll even come off at all he also said they come out looking funny 'cos a different type of dye is used i don't know if this is all true but i want to know people's take is on semi permanent tattoos i really want to get one or a couple but like i said i don't want to go permanent for a number of reasons including the possibility that i may not want it in the future plus i hate it when i see older people with tattoos which probably looked great when they were younger and had firmer skin but looks nasty on sagging skin any answers i dont think i believe in semi permenent tattoos ink from a tattoo is injected into your second layer of skin it will stay forever ive never seen temp tattoos except for when i was a kid and got them out of the little cent machines i think anyone claiming that they would have a semi permenent tattoo would be lying you have three layers of skin medically you cant put a tattoo on the top layer of skin thats just painting it on your skin basically if it stays it will start to fade out and peel off basically due to the fact that your top layer regenerates itself and sheds a temp tattoo is basically not real unless youre getting it from a store placing it on your skin holding a damp towel over it for seconds and pulling back the paper slowly i personally think that if you cant handle the comitment of getting one and you want one that will wash off then you shouldnt get one at all but if you seriously cant handle staying with one for the rest of your life but is still dying to get one then here read this http www technologyreview com nanotech even though the headline says semi permanent now scientists at harvard medical school brown university and duke university have engineered safe permanent and easily removable tattoo inks made from tiny microcapsules of natural pigments its permanent just has an easier removal process than the usual laser but still theres this he hopes to bring the first generation of microencapsulated inks to market in the next year youd have to wait awhile and im betting that most artists arent going to be so big on the ink at first so it will take a lot to find a shop that will do that and im guessing it will also cost more and that laser treatment still probably costs thousands like the rest of them  Scarification Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Skin Casting Social rule Henna Sento Manicure Textile manufacturing Floppy disk M16 (rifle) Ben Johnson (athlete) Scar Theory of conduct Menstrual cup Dairy Upholstery Poker jargon Craps Life insurance Prostate cancer Body painting Diving suit Drawing Avril Lavigne Laserdisc Printed circuit board IPod Earring Baldness treatments Memento (film) CPU cache CPU design Hair coloring Unreal Mach kernel Software engineering Customs and etiquette of Japan Heinkel He 112 Massage Tag Body modification Jackass: The Movie Fecal incontinence Make money fast The Death Gate Cycle Hip hop collaborations Nuclear power Wound Electrophysiology Tattoo gun Solar cell GunBound Nanotechnology Photography Aerial (dance move) Naruto jutsu Paint Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Stomach cancer Alcoholics Anonymous Muslim ibn Aqeel Irezumi EastEnders Micro-encapsulation Side Characters (Xenosaga) Insurance Knife Gaia Online Hip hop rivalries Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Keloid Ethernet Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hand grenade The Amber Spyglass Billboard Hot 100 Expert system Flood geology Compact disc Inkjet printer Enterprise content management Spice Girls Vegeta World War Three (Doctor Who) Embedded system Wheel of Fortune Theodicy Blood Simple

where can i find free printable fairy tattoo designs i have surfed through so many websites but i need free online sources have you tried searching for just fairy and not fairy tattoo when you add the word tattoo in there it limits the search area http images search yahoo com search images ylt a geu yyeldgihiatbzxnyoa ei utf p fairy fr tab web fr ks ans when you find an image you like you can take it to a talented tattoo artist they should be able to modify it in whatever way to make it look good on the skin however you should know that most fairys are pretty detailed and complex and the more detail that is in the tattoo the larger it has to be you can't get something super complex that is three inches by three inches you have to be realistic about what is possible and what you'll end up with if you try to fit too much in a small space  World Wide Web Tattoo Opera (web browser) Unicode Irezumi Mozilla Firefox Mozilla Application Suite Google Common Unix Printing System ITunes Amazon.com UTF-8 Bass guitar Python programming language HTTP cookie Base64 Internet Web crawler Gmail Namie Amuro Portable Document Format Game Boy Chess Stereoscopy Website Hash table Mirmo!

does anyone know what the borneo rose means i really really want this tattoo but i want to make sure i know what it means before i permanently stick it to my body any links and or information would be appreciated the following is info from a tattoo message board about the meaning of it check the link and you can decide who's right and wrong what i pasted below sounds most promising a lot of what has been said is wrong i actually come from borneo and i have the bunga teruong on my shoulders i hate to see it bastardised by people who don't understand the meaning or significance of it for starters there is no borneo tribe there are many different tribes some of which practice tattooing and some that don't among many there are the kayan kenyah kelabit murut berawan penan iban etc etc the tribe that are the most prominent at tattooing are the iban this is where the bunga teruong or borneo rose comes from the spirals in the middle are meant to symbolise the life cycle some villages say that it originally came from the spirals on the belly of tadpoles and when you actually go find a tadpole as i have done you can see this pattern the bunga teruong is supposed to guard the wearer from evil spirits some of the other tattoos on different parts of the body are for different purposes they used to tattoo the hands if they were headhunters the bunga teruong should always be done in pairs they can be on the back buttocks shoulders and or chest never should they be done singularly they are supposed to protect both sides of the body from evil just getting one would be silly as to the number of petals whilst they are all from the iban or dayak tribe different villages would have slightly different designs to the guy that said something about the polynesian war i don't know what the hell you're talking about borneo is not in polynesia and we have never had polynesians invade our land in fact polynesians mostly originated from borneo and the surrounding islands and travelled the seas to reach polynesia please don't get this tattoo unless you truly understand the symbolism behind them i and my fellow countrymen get furious when we see silly westerners with these ancestral designs who know nothing about the way we live nor our culture if you truly respect our culture and have some proper reason behind wanting to get the bunga teruong then please do the required research and get it done properly i know there are good westerners out there who take things seriously and respect us but there are many who know nothing and destroy the meaning behind our culture because they respect nothing stop ruining that which you don't own please show us some respect  Tattoo Dayak Polynesia Borneo Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist One Piece minor characters Malay people Iban Theory of conduct Aerial (dance move) Irezumi RuneScape quests Polynesian culture Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Shaggy dog story Social rule Gesture Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an RuneScape gods Volleyball Animism Force (Star Wars) Earring Violin Tai shogi M__ori Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Equine conformation Vegeta Professional wrestling throws The nature of God in Western theology Strap-on dildo Sin City The Death Gate Cycle French Polynesia Hazing Anthropology Milton H.

i recently got a tattoo on my lower leg and i believe it may be infected please help i got my tattoo done last tuesday july it is a compass star on my right calf above my ankle i have followed all of the aftercare instructions that i was given i wash it twice a day morning and night have used johnson's baby lotion on it because i broke out using a differnet lotion on my last tattoo everything was fine for the first few days but i started noticing what looked like cracks in some places i assumed this was just scabs then tonight after i washed it i noticed one spot where it looked like there was no ink and it looked like there was some pus as i was patting it dry i looked at the paper towel and noticed a little bit of blood too it has since been a few hours and there are spots that seem to be raised almost like bubbles and they are weeping a clear fluid it also hurts pretty bad at times needless to say i am totally freaking out any idea about what could be going on here i hope this is a good enough description thanks when you first got your tattoo did you use any a d ointment heres what my aftercare instructions were keep bandage on for at least one hour no longer than two hours do not re bandage always wash hands before touching fresh tattoo after removing bandage wash tattoo gently with anti bacterial soap and cool water for the first three days lightly apply vitamin a d ointment do not use a lot apply three to four times daily as needed when tattoo begins to feel dry after three to four days switch to an unscented hand lotion with a low alcohol content apply the same way you applied the a d ointment continue to use the hand lotion for the next two to three weeks until tattoo has healed your tattoo will go through a flaking stage much like a sunburn and may itch do not pick or scratch during this stage as it will damage your tattoo other things to avoid suntanning fake sunbed tanning and soaking baths swimming hot tubs my suggestion if it is as bad as you say it is is to go to your local hospital and talk to them merely putting an antibacterical healing aid like neosporin on in probably wont help but if you dont feel it necessary to go to the emergency room then i would just try the neosporin to see if it helps at all best of luck  Psoriasis Eczema Manicure Wound Body piercing Sauna Dialysis First aid Menstrual cup Sento Customs and etiquette of Japan First aid kit Sunscreen Textile manufacturing Sunburn Scabies Breastfeeding Fecal incontinence Aloe Common cold Hyperthermia Shaving Conjunctivitis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Casting Social rule EastEnders Knife Snakebite (bite) Earring Fire fighting Medical prescription 2000 Australian Grand Prix Tocopherol Stomach cancer Massage Acne Ron and Fez Certified Nursing Assistant Towel Bleeding Milton H.

what do you think of tatoos i always wanted a tatoo but my family is so anti tatoos i am older now and married and my husband wants a tatoo and thinks i should get one to i have not had children yet and one of my main concerns is that when i get pregnant your body stretches do you think that if your skin stretches it will ruin the tatoo as far as stretching it depends where you put it and remember if you're having kids soon if you have a visible tattoo you won't be able to tell your kids they can't have one without them throwing it in your face i've seen women with tattoos on the back of their neck under their hair when it's down the small of their back shoulder blades those spots won't stretch from giving birth or being pregnant especially if you're family is against tattoos you may want to choose a spot that only your husband can see that'll be a sexy secret for you two just remember to think long and hard about what you get tattooed on your body it really is permanant  Tattoo Professional wrestling holds Amy Dumas Angelina Jolie Irezumi Humphrey Bogart Acne Body modification Aerial (dance move) Timucua EastEnders Comanche Pregnancy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ouroboros Chris Benoit Professional wrestling throws Suplex Rayden Avril Lavigne Leopard Naruto jutsu Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Shawn Michaels Meryl Silverburgh Charmed Earring Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Ninja Scroll Friends Sexual attraction Ayyavazhi mythology Scarification Guinea pig Equine conformation Diving suit Rais massacre Professional wrestling slang Puberty Mystique (comics) Body painting Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fecal incontinence Def Jam Fight for New York 613 mitzvot Depilation Pittsburgh Steelers Side Characters (Xenosaga) Samurai Deeper Kyo Sub-Zero Massage Professional wrestling aerial techniques Abortion debate Piccolo Junior Saga Kurt Angle Eddie Guerrero Mark Calaway Nocte Waterworld Sara Sidle Jackass: The Movie Swingout Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) Hair Dana Scully Marilyn Monroe Married... with Children Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Katharine Hepburn Cheetah Human Car safety The Rock (entertainer) New York Giants Manhunt (video game) Neckbreaker Scapula Kodocha Panthera hybrid Kain (Legacy of Kain) Crazy Horse Body piercing John F.

anyone who has a foot tattoo and a lower back tattoo i generally have a very low pain tolerance but i have one on my lower back and it barely hurt at all so i was wondering what is the pain comparison for the two i have both a lower back and foot tattoo by far the lower back hurt the least the pain with a foot tattoo in my opinion is very different that the lower back with my foot the pain was more of a sore type pain where it hurt to put pressure on it for around days after getting it done either way if you really want a tattoo on your foot i would say go for it just know that for about days you will probably limp a bit but its all worth it in the end  Chester Bennington Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation Breastfeeding Massage Tattoo Mattress Weight training Cape Feare COX-2 inhibitor Decompression sickness Jackass: The Movie Hip fracture Horse tack Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Memento (film) Doom enemies Rayden Motorcycle High-heeled shoe Wal-Mart Back pain Dallas, Texas Diving Chronic pain Embedded system Psoriasis Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Carpal tunnel syndrome Spanking Pain Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sideshow Bob Aerial (dance move) Gout First aid Quebec general election, 2003 Domestic rabbit Pitcher Self-harm Broadband Internet access Earring Dialysis Tide Local anesthesia Smallville (Season 4) Professional wrestling attacks Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Acupuncture Drill bit Sound Scarification LSD Herpes simplex virus Hepatitis C Limp Bizkit Pazyryk Nuclear power phase-out Archery Body modification Customs and etiquette of Japan Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 Ra (board game) Skateboarding trick The Shining (film) Internal ballistics Hurt (song) Chronic fatigue syndrome Stress fracture Sense Vegetarianism Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Cricket Montgomery Burns Hiking Prostate cancer Paintball Nine Inch Nails Inflation Namie Amuro Analgesic Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Milton H.

advice on getting a tattoo for a first timer i am going to get a tattoo either tomorrow or within the next few days i'm young only but i know for sure i will not regret this tattoo the tattoo will be of kanji characters that mean okinawa which is where i have spent the last four years of my life the tattoo will be on my upper left arm and will be fairly decent sized to small my dad said it would probably take about minutes or less to complete the main thing i'm concerned about is the pain and the price the artist said the price will be roughly and that seams kind of cheap considering he charged my friend about to get ashley on his chest but he does look younger than me even though we're both the same age i know this guy is reputable he has like binders full of photos that i looked through so can anyone give me any tips while i'm in the chair or explain to me why the price is quite low this guy did my friend's tattoo and the quality of the work looks pretty good my friend's tattoo was in intricate cursive and mine is going to be pretty simple just normal kanji and the guy is japanese too so i guess maybe thats why he's charging less for me i have no idea why the price is so low i was scammed on my st one for a silver dollar sized tatt it depends on the size and the ink honestly having my ears pierced hurt a lot worse than a tattoo i describe it as a cat scratch you know how it swells after and burns some but it's very relaxing at the same time just sit and close your eyes if you need to and feel the vibration of the needle just when you think it hurts he she will spray some cool water on it to wipe of the extra ink and it feels so good the artist is usually listening to some pretty cool tunes too they are addictive and one reason is because it does feel good in a strange sort of way believe me getting a shot in the ass from a dr hurts a hell of a lot worse  Tattoo Theory of conduct Nine Inch Nails Body modification Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Irezumi Humphrey Bogart Sento Professional wrestling attacks Wood carving Blood on the Tracks Social rule Inflation Fast bowling Unreal Pitaten Scarification Electrophysiology Earring Aerial (dance move) Violin Garfield The Rolling Stones Diving Shogi Kyle Broflovski Professional wrestling holds Great Teacher Onizuka Jackass: The Movie Ranma __ characters Extreme Programming Friends Loudspeaker Blood (computer game) Shaggy dog story EastEnders Earth Girl Arjuna Recurring South Park characters Kanji Characters of Naruto Mattress Kurt Cobain 2000 Australian Grand Prix Universal Century Technology Piccolo Junior Saga Double bass Kodocha The Fairly OddParents Gramophone record Arguments for and against drug prohibition Double Dragon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Avenue Q Upholstery The Adventures of Pete & Pete Norway national football team Menstrual cup Hip hop rivalries Acupuncture Sampling (music) Ecco the Dolphin Daredevil Live At Leeds Bat Lash Aikido Sub-Zero Time Out of Mind Japanese name Angelina Jolie Turbocharger Knife United States dollar Treehouse of Horror V Sin City Electric guitar Body piercing The nature of God in Western theology Solar cell Rich Mullins Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) Hellsing Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Shen Gong Wu Kill Bill Vanilla Ninja Tokusatsu Galaxy Angel Alan Moore Cliff Richard Vowel Ninja Sentai Kaku Ranger

can someone explain how their foot tattoo felt and is now i want a quote tattoo'd from my ankle to my foot someone told me that some artists dont do feet because it can damage a nerve or something is that true what does the process feel like like a needle and also how fast does it fade and about how much are they i have a tattoo on my foot and it felt like being carved into which is basically what is happening anyways i'm a wimp but i didn't cry of course there's pain but its not too bad i've only had my tattoo for a month but i've talked to two tattoo artists and they said that it is more likley to fade so touch ups are recomended and its recomended to not wear shoes for a least two weeks cause if the tattoo is rubbing against your shoe it could cause it to fade more i would put sunscreen on every day if your in the sun a lot to help keep it from fading and my tat was simple to do and just black so it only cost me but it does depend on what your getting and the tat shop artist i've never heard of damaged nerve and i've researched this a lot but it is true that some artists won't do feet tats hope this helps  Tattoo Kurt Angle Shoe Sunscreen Prostate cancer Traumatic brain injury Scarification Namie Amuro Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Shaggy dog story Social rule Vanilla Ninja Fast bowling Irezumi Memento (film) Fable (video game) Blood on the Tracks Stomach cancer Kurt Cobain Diabetic neuropathy Pazyryk Acupuncture Equine conformation Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Contender (television series) Breastfeeding Tattoo You Earring High-heeled shoe Milton H.

what does a tattoo feel like jus wonderin thanks like someone is scratching you over and over again it doesn't really hurt but it isn't pleasant after about ten minutes your endorphins kick in and you barely notice unil the end when they are putting highlights in and they have to tattoo what's already been tattooed or if you get it over bone like your shoulder blade you can occasionally actually feel it grind the bone and that hurts but it's totally worth it  YuYu Hakusho Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Equine conformation Memento (film) Naruto jutsu Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Rayden Kurt Angle Self-harm Ninja Scroll Scarification Piccolo Junior Saga Jackass: The Movie Knife The Death Gate Cycle Professional wrestling slang Canadian football Tenshinhan Swingout Professional wrestling attacks Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Esperanto grammar The Shining (film) Ashlee Simpson True Crime: Streets of LA Angelina Jolie Characters of Naruto Dallas, Texas Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sento American football Shaggy dog story Cape Feare Time Out of Mind Guinea pig Laws of cricket The Curse of Fenric Fist of the North Star Shoulder Tattoo Blood (computer game) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Inside Namie Amuro Nine Inch Nails Poker jargon Vanilla Ninja Non-native pronunciations of English Zero (Mega Man) Earring Bryan Robson Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Scapula Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Vernon Schillinger Mileena Dragon Booster Oh My Goddess!

i am considering getting a tattoo and have a particular tattoo in mind i am thinking of getting a frog holding a heart with my kids names and birthdates inside the heart what do you think can anyone give me an opinion if that is something you think you would want then great however you do realize that to get a heart with names and dates inside of it the heart would have to be big big as in atleast three square inches at minimum which means the frog holding it would have be be much larger unless you want a tiny frog holding a gigantic heart it really is something to think about while your idea may sound feasable when you say it in reality it would probably look odd if you got that at the size that it would need to be and any artist who tells you that they can do it really small is just wrong lettering can't be tiny or it just won't hold up over time good luck on whatever you decide tho  Game show Vegeta Double bass Poker jargon Betting (poker) Marathon (computer game) Saint Seiya Tattoo The Fairly OddParents Treehouse of Horror V Numerology Craps Jon Secada Vanilla Ninja Dead Like Me Infinity Care Bears Phoebe Halliwell Aerial (dance move) My Sassy Girl Rocko's Modern Life Mantra Glossary of graph theory Dinosaur Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Radiohead Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Adjective Professional wrestling aerial techniques Friedrich Schleiermacher Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance The Contender (television series) Ed, Edd n Eddy Memento (film) Sant Thakar Singh House of Leaves Ashlee Simpson Paper size Sonic Adventure Psychokinesis Hey Jude Modernism Intelligent design Jumpstart 3rd Grade Lung The Life and Times of Juniper Lee David Hume W.

if tattoos were artwork hanging in a gallery would you visit it i find that most tattoos are hideous i understand wanting to be 'cool' and 'hip' and 'oh so rebellious' but of tattoos are just plain ugly especially the big ones i do realize tattoos are a kind of art but i just think the prevailing style is rather unappealing so gnarly and busy and dark and generally detracting from the beauty of the human body in my opinion anyway still i know not to judge people who get them to each their own d it depends a lot of tattoo artists are incredibly good artists and do beautiful artwork and prints that don't end up as tattoos some even exhibit their work in galleries a close friend of my boyfriend is a tattoo artist and he's also done some really beautiful pieces of art if i felt they were good as an artist not just a tattooist and enjoyed their work then i would most definately visit their exhibition their are also a lot of people out there that tattoo but are terrible artists the quality ie appearance of the tattoos they do may look good but their art could be horrible a lot of these people work from flash copying designs out of books etc this i feel is the distinction between a 'tattooist' and a 'tattoo artist' a tattoo artist has the ability to take an idea or suggestion draw it up in to a beautiful design and then turn it in to a good quality tattoo on a persons skin i agree that a lot of people have some really ugly tattoos i believe that is because these people didn't do enough research to find a good tattoo artist and because they lack the imagination to make a tattoo their own i'll readily admit i was guilty of just picking a tattoo out of a book and now i regret it but soon i'll be getting it covered up with something beautiful that i've put my thought an imagination in to i feel the human skin is a blank canvas and i feel tattoos and piercings are a way of making it more interesting and of expressing yourself the problem is a lot of people see tattoos and piercings as a fashion accessory rather than a form of expression thats why in so many ways it's started to become uniform and generic for hundreds if not thousands of years tribes from all over the world have used body modification as a way of being seen as more beautiful or to carry some other kind of symbolism women in certain tribes in africa are not seen as beautiful and able to marry unless they have rows of scars cut in to their skin it all depends on your social ideals and how you percieve things like tattoos as to whether you accept them tattoos can be extremely beautiful and a lot of tattoo artist are incredibly talented people often overlooked because tattoos are still general socially unacceptable  Tattoo Art Clothing Theory of conduct Physical attractiveness Irezumi Scarification Abortion debate Human The Emancipation of Mimi Dragon Booster Body modification Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Pablo Picasso W.

what is a reasonable tip for a tattoo is it just like when you go to a restaurant i think it honestly depends on how pleased you are with it i just got my nd tattoo and i loved it so i tipped bucks now that is a big tip i'm not saying you have to tip that much but you should go with how much you feel comfortable giving bucks i think should be the least amount you have to think these people are custom drawing your artwork and they have to deal with you moving while they're tattoing and also getting it perfect for you plus there is always that backup protection that just in case something goes wrong with the tattoo like you have to get it re touched up that's included in the price of your tattoo and you don't want them to mess that part up for sure  Tattoo Tip Theory of conduct Good Charlotte Sento Apa Tani Poker jargon Straight edge Badly Drawn Kitties The Adventures of Pete & Pete Friends Ashlee Simpson Call girl Vanilla Ninja Blood on the Tracks Supply and demand Atayal The Death Gate Cycle Restaurant The nature of God in Western theology MAME Game show Social rule Major League Baseball television contracts New York Knicks Paintball Capitalism Poker Backup Spanking Kingdom of Loathing Waiter The Emancipation of Mimi Namie Amuro Maimonides Diving Microeconomics Whose Line Is It Anyway?

i want to do a tattoo myself on my hand how do i do it and what sort of ink would i use hi there in my opinion the best ink to use would be either indian ink or quill ink the same ink that you would use to write on parchment paper i have done several tattoo's this way on myself others and i have never had a problem with infections or other health related issues some look very nice and professional remember tattoo's were done this way many thousands of years before the west side of the world started using tattoo guns as for applying the tattoo itself make sure that the design is clearly drawn on after you have washed your hands use a latex glove on your other hand that you will use to hold the needle or if someone else is going to do it for you make sure their hands are clean and they are wearing latex gloves the needle that i would use would be either a pleasure piercing needle or a sewing needle as they are both very sharp so the will not damage the skin after the tattoo is finished i would use a vitamin e based skin cream as this will aid the healing hope this helps and good luck with your tattoo  Body piercing Earring Irezumi Clothing Upholstery Scarification Skin Fecal incontinence Prostate cancer Psoriasis Menstrual cup Safe sex Eczema Glove Anal sex Sewing machine Cape Feare Fountain pen Hepatitis C Stomach cancer Comanche Suture Gaia Online Knife Tefillin Play piercing Acupuncture Drawing Strap-on dildo Dialysis Inkjet printer Printmaking Certified Nursing Assistant Sexually-transmitted infection Dragon Booster Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ear piercing instrument Drill bit Methamphetamine Pen and ink Textile manufacturing terminology Label Bookbinding Intravenous therapy Boxing Nail (anatomy) Ink Gramophone record Scabies Diving suit Swimming Scar Tocopherol Gay bathhouse Naruto jutsu BloodRayne Sento United States dollar Dairy Kirby: Canvas Curse Avril Lavigne Sex toy Parchment Ballpoint pen Textile manufacturing HIV Softball Manicure Hazing Terminal ballistics Fisting Kurt Angle Veganism Iron-gall nut ink Applique Mattress Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist AIDS Pneumonia Characters in the Smurfs Acne Paint Arguments for and against drug prohibition Hamster Printing press Sewing Latex allergy 613 mitzvot Vanilla Ninja Circumcision Traumatic brain injury Vinland map Pazyryk The Invisibles Amulet

have young women getting frequently tattooed ruined the art and culture of tattooing i m all for women s equal right to get tattooed this question has nothing to do with whether or not one thinks it is proper or classy trashy to be tattooed in fact i find tattooing on women to be attractive though that s only one aspect of tattooing and i highly respect women like somebody on here who are very smart about and dedicated to tattooing my question is serious not sexist tattooing in western society has had a culture of it s own and we all know that culture is about meaning what does it mean to be tattooed why do people get tattooed my opinion on the right reasons to get tattooed includes the images being tattooed inspire you the images fuel your imagination a more recent thing in the west love of art and taking that art beyond banal canvases of museums along with this there is something deep about the permanence of it and the fact that it is on skin w blood etc to mark affiliation with a group affiliation with a group makes people feel like they are a part of something larger than themselves a memorial along with these comes a sense of permanence permanence reinforces commitment finally i think tattooing has also been resorted to by marginalized disenfranchised people as a type of property if nothing else in this world at least they have their tattoos which will go with them to their death think for example of sailors who were among the first to popularize getting tattooed during long shipping voyages in crap conditions they could use all the inspiration they got and these people really had no property even the clothes on their backs were often in pawn if they went overboard the one thing they would have is their tattoos also what they look at and dream about during long days away from home now why are trendy people getting tattooed nowadays dangerous factor people thinks it makes them wild or dangerous in some way but guess what it used to be much harder to get tattooed you had to travel or interact with certain dangerous people to do so these people were not polite not there to be nice to you or stand for any of your bullcrap it sickens me how encouraging people are on this site towards people asking should i get this tattoo no tattooing is not meant to be as easy to get even if cheaper than starbucks in the current atmosphere of have a nice day convenience tattooing any associations of danger are actually removed to symbolize something this is such a load of b s yes tattoos do symbolize they indeed mean something but there are many different ways of representing or symbolizing the type of signing that trendy people usually do is not the type of signing common to tattoo culture it would take a long and complicated discussion to explain this you either get it or you don t to memorialize this was the one past traditional tattoo culture motivation for tattooing that the trendy people have harped in on and blown all out of proportion i don t know if it s because they see stuff like miami ink where everyone as instructed to them by the show s producers walks in with some story about how blah blah happened and they need this tattoo of blah blah to represent that trendy people seem to feel the need just to make any mark on their bodies to mark that something happened this shooting star is because my grandma died huh anxiousness to be experienced as teens most of us felt anxious about losing our virginity once you had sex you joined the ranks of the non virgin population the experienced population a similar process seems to be at work with tattooing people are anxious to get marked in any way to join this club but here is the thing joining the club isn t meant to be easy there is inconvenience pain stigma permanence inconvenience pain stigma permanence these are the things that the trendy tattoo people are bent on getting around everything questions on yahoo answers for instance are driven towards avoiding these obstacles but they are the very obstacles that give meaning to being tattooed to being in the club in the absense of this meaning tattoos have become meaningless fashion the trendy people try to add meaning symbolism in real tattoo culture someone is inspired by something so much that they want it permanently put on their body in trendy tattooing people decide first that they need to get tattooed to become part of the cool experiened club to attract people sexually to work out their psychological issues of things like isolation and poor self image and then they try to think up a tattoo usually some banal shape or image inspired by commercial logo ing branding and add to it some stated meaning do i need to go any further in explaining how utterly bankrupt this trendy tattoo culture is trendy men and women are equally guilty of lowering the standards of tattoo culture and turning it into cheap branding but women especially seem significant in this process because of the nature of popular women s culture along with women s historical relationship to the art of tattooing they especially have sought to remove the inconvenience can i pay with my credit card what brand of lotion should i buy how many times a day should i rub it in let me just get a little star here on the spot today let me go online and ask pain where does it hurt least what creams can i use to reduce to numb it stigma stop calling it a tramp stamp i got my tattoos for me they are mine why get it in a place where you can t show it off permanence how much does tattoo removal cost and does it really work notice that the vast majority of people asking tattoo questions on this site are women what do you think this means thanks i wish i could change the title of this question a bit it is hard to articulate succintly i don't really like the sound of women ruining it makes it sound like women of course i only mean certain ones as the agents i think a better way to say it is that tattooing has changed towards accomodating this class of trendy people both sexes but especially to accomodate some of the desires of women who are a relatively new clientele for tattooing i read all of what you have written and i agree with most of your major points i do think tattoos have sort of become a trend and i know exactly what you mean by can i pay with a credit card tattoos are a whole lot easier to get now than they were when sailors were getting them i do think it's rediculous that people get tattoos in an effort to show that it symbolizes something when really they just got it to be cool as far as women sort of changing the idea and culture of tattooing i think this is one of your least valid points yes maybe some things have changed since but isn't that what all cultures do maybe it sucks every little meaning behind tattoo culture maybe it's just changing and you don't want to be put into that group of trendy men and women you keep talking about so in order not to be in it because obviously your reasons for getting inked are so much better you criticize it all i have to say is that my entire family has gotten inked except me grandparents included now they got tattoos when they were hard to get i think tattoos are body art i think the history is awesome i think some tattoos are effing rediculous a playboy bunny what the but overall tattooing is available it is growing in popularity more people want them more women want them women generally take better care of themselves why are you freaking out about the fact that someone asked what kind of lotion to use yes i think you have valid points not every one should get a tattoo but your whole deal about women and trendy tattoos sort of taking away from the culture i think your just whining because you don't want the original hardcore tattoo peeps to be thinking that you got your tattoos to be cool and fit in with the growing popularity of it all hell if you want to be original don't get

a question for any tattoo artists does it gross you out to give tattoos to overweight people i am like pounds over weight and i was just wondering if people were like ugh another fatty today when they have to tattoo someone bigger thanks this question isn't to offend anyone i just wanted some opinions a body is a body just like a doctor you're just a person they're working with body mass index is pretty much irrelevant except maybe in really extreme cases where health i'd hazard a guess that personal hygiene still outweighs most all of those cases the artist who works on me is far more troubled by attitude than anything else some artists may vary but i'll bet all of the really good and professional ones are like this  Body mass index Obesity Tattoo Theory of conduct Scarification Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Social rule Dieting Weight Involuntary commitment Capital punishment Sento Body piercing British national identity card Adjustable gastric band Physical examination Political correctness Pound Sexual orientation Binge eating disorder Abortion debate Ron and Fez Asperger syndrome Burial Super Size Me Anorexia nervosa Physical attractiveness Helicopter Bipolar disorder Unreal Sauna Agnosticism Hip hop rivalries Clothing Explosive material Healthy eating Goodness and value theory Mass The nature of God in Western theology Serial killer Britney Spears One Piece minor characters Human height Center of mass Hygiene YuYu Hakusho Extreme Programming Ebola Methamphetamine Atkins Nutritional Approach Public health in mainland China Arguments for and against drug prohibition Legal aspects of transsexualism Mixed martial arts Hepatitis C Mental health The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy John Lott Doctorate Nutrition Childbirth The Holocaust Masturbation Bodybuilding Vanilla Ninja Hypoglycemia Stomach cancer Dragon Booster Terri Schiavo Puberty Card Sharks Roper v.

does anyone know the meaning of ryan phillipe's new tribal tattoo i saw it in intouch weekly back in july it's very cool looking i haven't seen it and i doubt it means anything most people who get them just want something that looks cool or tough or whatever i seriously doubt he has any tribal ancestry in general i am rarely impressed with celebrity tattoos for some reason they insist on getting crappy work done you'd think that since they have the money they'd make the effort to be impressive oh well  Tattoo Vanilla Ninja Irezumi Angelina Jolie Karankawa Comanche H.P.

tattoo artists what are your opinions on sun and moon tattoos do you think it's a way too common played out design or do you think it will always be one of those classic designs that can be improved upon and made to look unique for the person getting it just asking because i never thought i'd give in to what i thought was the most common image but then i loved the design the artist did for me and got it i'd love to hear your opinions thank you i have a couple of moon tattoos and i love them honestly who cares if someone thinks that a particular design is played out if the design means something to you then that makes it special i agree that you should find someone who is excited to do your tattoo there's just something about an artist who is excited to do something that makes the tattoo pop even more i have a couple from an artist that i've gone back to time and time again and every time i see him he's excited about the design because i tell him what i want and allow him creative freedom so he can really create something special for me a couple of the tats i have could be considered played out but they were designed with excitement so i know that they are beautiful and unique if you want a moon i say go for it and work with an artist who is excited to work on you  Irezumi Tattoo Art Aesthetic Realism Strap-on dildo Creativity Martin Sharp W.

do ankle tattoos look good when on both the inside and outer ankle do a lot of people have them also is a sun moon a stupid design for a tattoo or can it be a classic image especially when done by a good artist thanks whether a tattoo looks good or not is generally determined by the talent of the artist the most wonderful tattoo idea can be ruined by a horrible artist and also a crappy tattoo idea can be transformed into something wonderful with the right artist if you want a sun and moon then go for it it's not something that i'd get because i really don't feel a connection to the sun or the moon you definitely must be mindful of the tattoos you get and make sure that you do feel something for them and that they're not just a design that you think is cool or neat good luck with whatever you decide  Tattoo Vanilla Ninja Art Social rule The Apprentice 2 Tokusatsu Irezumi Memento (film) Astrological sign Galactic Civilizations Ra (board game) W.

would you be annoyed if your friend got the exact same tattoo as you i've had my tattoo on my foot for years its one i designed myself although its quite simple it's really personal to me as it represents my grandparents who died within months of each other last month my friend had the exact same tattoo on her wrist am i right to be annoyed i know i can't do anything about it but its still annoyed me she knew what the design stood for we've known each other since we were five and she was a bit support after i'd lost my grandparents h ll yeah u have the right to be annoyed i d be down right p ssed off girl all of my tatt s are symbolic and that is something very personal i never get a tatt off the shelf because of this reason i m confused as to how the tatt shop kept your design that s just not cool i d be b tching at them big time they have no rights to your design of course your tatt is really personal to you people that design their own tatt is because it represents something very important in their life the majority of mine are for my dogs they are my kids they are all symbolic to each one if i saw my tatt on someone i d be headed for the tatt shop fortunately i don t have to worry about that because of the artist that did mine is no longer doing tatt s my next one is in memory of my father and i will walk out of there with my design i definitely think it was disrespectful of your friend to get the same tatt as yours she should of at least had the common courtesy to ask you first since she liked it so much she also should have respected your design and had changes made so it was not identical i m very sorry this has happened to you you paid tribute to your grandparents with your designed tatt is there anything that you can have added to it to make it your original i know it s not fair that you would have to make these changes but at this point it is the best way to keep it original be sure to get your design from the tatt shop this time i d do some checking around with other tatt shops to see what their policy is on keeping tatt s that are not designed by them i look at it as you have all copyrights to your design and the tatt shop owes you best of luck hon p s if i remember i'll ask my bf about the copyright laws his best friend's cousin did mine he also knows other artists that design tatt's and sell them to the shops  Social rule The Fairly OddParents Tattoo Copyright law of the United Kingdom The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Infantilism Copyright Pitaten Hey Arnold!

does anyone have tattoos on their feet foot i am thinking about getting one on the outside of my foot do many tattoo artists do this or allowed is it a state by state thing i am in idaho thanks tattooing on the foot is pretty common however there are a few things to think about usually the shop min on hands feet neck is higher simply for the fact that it's not an easy spot on the body to tattoo and most people don't sit as well you better be able to wear flip flops so some kind of shoe that's going to allow your tattoo to breath and heal for anywhere from weeks to a month or so feet take longer to heal i've heard a few different reasons on this but i know from experiance that it's true no matter the logic behind it some artists really don't like working on feet just like there are some people out there that are totally creeped out by them so are some artists so don't get your heart set on an artist until you find out how foot friendly they are best of luck to you  Tattoo The Death Gate Cycle Paul Is Dead Aerial (dance move) Customs and etiquette of Japan Body piercing Theory of conduct Theodicy Milton H.

is this phrase ok for a lower back tattoo i want to put the phrase wisdom is proved righteous by it's works on my lower back near my hips and i want to have two angels holding up each side of the banner the words will be on does that sound cute the phrase can say whatever you want you're the only one who can okay that but my concern is the length of the phrase do you think it would all fit without having to be done too small and witht he angels holding up the banner it couldn't be too small because then you would lose detail and it wouldn't look right just my opinion maybe think of a shorter phrase or go to different artists and see what they say but personally i think you may run into the problem of the phrase being too long for the type placement you want good luck it sounds sweet  Predestination Equine conformation Editor Vowel Characters of Naruto Quotation mark Password Catch phrase Heinkel He 100 Bulgarian language Native American music Justification (theology) Biblical inerrancy Namie Amuro Internal ballistics Time Out of Mind Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints American and British English differences Buttocks Marvin Gaye Rigging Microphone Charades Customs and etiquette of Japan Slow Train Coming Existence Japanese tea ceremony Alternative hip hop Aerial (dance move) Tattoo Ontological argument Theodicy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pet Sounds Salsa music Chinese character Chester Bennington Selling out Crossword Aramaic language Otaku Fast bowling Tefillin Shaggy dog story Adjective Blonde on Blonde John the Baptist Subjunctive mood Book of Job New Zealand English Professional wrestling throws West Coast hip hop Day-Age Creationism Pyramid (game show) Strap-on dildo Maimonides Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics Adjustable gastric band Hip hop culture Mouse (computing) English grammar Pok__mon Abilities Amidah Shit Names and titles of Jesus Cricket Soul music Soul Glossary of partner dance terms Skinny Puppy Meat Loaf The Pet Sounds Sessions Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Piccolo Junior Saga New York Giants Hip hop music Cryptic crossword Extreme Programming Stuttering Hearing impairment Phrase Slovenian language Batting (cricket) Killian documents Violin Summa Theologiae Theory of conduct Philo DNA__ Undergarment Music history of the United States (1980s to the present) Bowing (social) Singlish Pipe organ Metalanguage Chopsticks Social justice Reservoir Dogs Digital photography

do you ever regret having a tattoo put on of your body ill put it to you this way i have tattoos of them i got all within days one of them is a tattoo of a canadian maple leaf im not canadian i got it because for about a year and a half i was very good friends with this chick that was canadian she was the perfect woman in my eyes looks attitude personality everything was just perfect then she moved to canada before i could ever ask her out about months after she left i went and got a canadian maple leaf tattooed on my wrist the size is inches by inches pretty big piece for a wrist on the opposite side of that one is a celtic shamrock same size both designed using celtic knotwork by me on my lunch break at work the shamrock is for me because i am of irish heritage anyways my whole wrist was swollen for about a week both tatts got infected because i am allergic to tattoo ink yeah all my tats have gotten infected unless i was on the medication to heal one tattoo while getting another one and even when she came back and i finally asked her out just to find out that she had become a different person she was still so damn cool and laid back but she had just changed its hard to describe how but i could just tell that she did some say that the tattoo was a waste because i dont feel the same way about her now than i did before she has since moved back to canada she just felt like she didnt belong here in texas but even after all that even though people tell me the tattoo was a waste or that its equivilant to getting a name tattooed on me or even the fact that i got the tattoo to commemorate someone i wasnt even married or engaged to was just stupid i dont look at it that way i got the tattoo so that i would never forget all the good times i had with her and so that even when i meet someone that i will start a relationship with i can remember that i never have to settle for someone for any reason that at one time there was a perfect woman for me out there and theres still one out there know it sounds weird but this tattoo is the one that no matter what happens i will never regret it all my tattoos mean something to me and i am able to look at them and remember the good times i had and shut out all the present bad times  Kodocha Social rule Body piercing Avril Lavigne Friends Sydney Riot of 1879 Kyle Broflovski Piccolo Junior Saga Shaggy dog story Scarification Toronto Maple Leafs Unreal Order of Canada Stanley Cup Kurt Angle The Ashlee Simpson Show The Death Gate Cycle The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Vanilla Ninja Britney Spears Sento Blood on the Tracks Sexually-transmitted infection Cliff Richard Jon Secada Menstrual cup Badly Drawn Kitties Memento (film) Violin Random Harvest Weight training Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Ice hockey Textile manufacturing Hiberno-English Earring Leon White Chester Bennington Ben Johnson (athlete) Ashlee Simpson The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's) Big Brother UK series 6 Picts Namie Amuro Parsifal Son Goku (Dragon Ball) God Emperor of Dune Teen Girl Squad New York Knicks Good Times John Diefenbaker Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Urinary incontinence Wood Canadian Senate Philip J.

significance of tattoo on ladies lower backs personally i think they are nice i had a friend over the weekend refer to them as 'tramp stamps' i thought that was pretty discriminatory but a funny way of looking at it but there is some truth in it you know when ever a guy sees a lady with one they are not staring specifically at their tattoos lol so what is your opinion of them do they signify these women are tramps just innocent art or seriously i could give a rats azz where the woman gets a tattoo however some women do flat out say yeah its a tramp stamp hehe usually they're playboy model wanna bes or just ditsy as hell when they act like that me personally i too would look at a lower back tattoo as a target its like all these women getting tongue piercings its so common that nobody really believes that they were originally done to women for the pleasure of the man and vice versa anyways the term tramp stamp doesnt mean that a lady is a tramp for getting in put right there like the other million women that get them right there but in this perverted day in age something like that is just a target for the guy to jizz on kind of like a tattoo right above the womans vagina its a target for the guys to jizz on why else would a woman get a tattoo right there to make it look better hell if you have a vagina it looks perfect the way it is its not a christmas tree you have to put a bunch of decorations on to make it look presentable sorry got off track what bothers me about tattoos on womens lower backs is that when you look at them because they are showing very easily because they are wearing painted on hip hugger pants and a skin tight boob showing shirt on they get pizzed off at you for looking wtf thats why when a woman says the whole i wanted a tattoo i could cover up if i needed to bs i laugh because if they really wanted a tattoo they could cover up theyd get it elsewhere like the ankle shoulder or some other bullsh t hidding spot if you get a tattoo dont cover it up and if its a tattoo for you then youd get it in a place where you could see it simply by looking down at it i just dont understand why a woman would get a tattoo there its more like a trend now a days more than anything and the only thing that makes sense out of it all is that a woman gets a tattoo there is so that she can be more sexy and playful in bed hence the term tramp stamp so if your daughter gets one dont trust her if you have one be honest with yourself and everyone else youre not a tramp but you wanted to be a little more exciting for your man if thats not the case then you fell deeply into the biggest tattoo trend since the sailor tattoos congrats  Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Tattoo Undergarment AFI 100 Years series Avenue Q Professional wrestling holds Angelina Jolie Kimono EastEnders The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie SpongeBob SquarePants Nudity Recurring South Park characters Oral sex Cliff Richard Sin City Spice Girls Marilyn Monroe Professional wrestling slang Jon Secada Body piercing Kenny McCormick Strap-on dildo Aerial (dance move) Social rule Hiking The Catcher in the Rye Social aspects of clothing The Ashlee Simpson Show Human Kurt Angle Professional wrestling throws Earring Sinfest Joan Crawford Nine Inch Nails Avril Lavigne Anal sex Comanche Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Human sexual behavior Clothing Barbie Anne Boleyn Bob Jones University The Amber Spyglass One Tree Hill (TV series) Time Out of Mind Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Ren and Stimpy Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Ranma __ characters Great Teacher Onizuka Trousers Memento (film) Violin Lady and the Tramp American Psycho Shaggy dog story Trailer Park Boys Eastern Orthodox Church Undergrads Shorts Jackass: The Movie Hellsing Joke Irezumi Ion Davidov Shawn Michaels Good Charlotte Late Night with Conan O'Brien Political correctness God Emperor of Dune Blood on the Tracks Married... with Children Free will Gaia Online Internet slang Stewie Griffin About a Boy Ashlee Simpson Sex toy Wood carving Britney Spears Moral Politics Frankie Laine

ear stretching hi i'm planning on getting my ears stretched and i was just wondering what's the size gauge that people already have with normal piercings like with guns i know guns are bad but i was little and how do they stretch the hole with the long tapers through your piercing and then put the tunnel on the end and you're done around what would the price be all i want are small tunnels as in the next size up from the normal ear piering sized hole and what about my old earrings if i dont stretch my ears too much will i still be able to wear them gah i'm so excited thanks to all the people who actually contributed and atually answered instead of telling me not to do it or it looks gross oh and btw i am a girl and i do like stretched ears deal with it standard piercing gauge is g stretching is done using a sterilized taper that goes from one gauge to the next www safepiercing org price will vary depending on the quality of the jewelry used and the shop you go to the shop i used to work at would stretch you for free with a jewelry purchase to get a good idea of what good quality jewelry is going to cost check out www bmeshop com remember you want to use either surgical steel lvm or autoclavable acrylic even though it's a fresh piercing any other porous materials wood bone stone certain acrylic clay etc can actually cause infections and trust me i've seen people with it and it's disgusting however i have to burst your bubble tunnels aren't usually found in anything smaller then a or guage most people can skip sizes when they're going from a to say an but it might still take you a few different stretches to get the look that you want at those in between stages use the most inexpensive jewelry you can or you just waste your money because you really can't wear old jewelry again unless your down sizing which is possible and depends on each person's skin i always used to suggest using acrylic retainers because they're only about bucks a pop and you can keep them around in case you loose a piece of jewelry later so you don't loose size  Earring Body piercing Ear piercing instrument Tattoo Drill bit Violin Diamond Bong Shotgun Prince Albert piercing Gramophone record Wood Mattress Strap-on dildo Upholstery Clothing Knife Floppy disk Plastic Brewery Table saw Barbell (piercing) Handloading Microeconomics Seismic retrofit Shen Gong Wu Firearm Poker jargon Dialysis Screw Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Menstrual cup Piercing migration Spark plug Domestic rabbit Stomach cancer Hearing aid Gaia Online Menstrual cycle Urinary incontinence Welding M16 (rifle) Shell (projectile) Tongue piercing Airsoft Intraocular lens Diving suit Katana Rolling-element bearing Lighting Knitting Terminal ballistics Textile manufacturing Comanche Textile manufacturing terminology Penis Pottery Navel piercing Technology in the Stargate universe Tutankhamun O scale Rail tracks Hand grenade Body modification Temporal bone Diamond cut Paintball Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Malignant melanoma Traumatic brain injury Puberty The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Cat Solar cell Capitalism Wood carving Guitar Ear Empire Burlesque Explosive material Vampire Items in the Metroid series Labor theory of value View camera The Inside Commodity markets Jennifer Lopez Illegal drug trade Ammolite Cremation

tattoo prices yea i really want to get tattoos later in life like in a few years after high school price ranges of a decent good tattoo lets say lettering on my forearms tattoo prices are going to depend on so many different factors that there is no way that your going to get a very accurate answer with out talking to the tattoo artist that you want to actually do the ink size of the letters type of font and size of the saying would be things you need to start getting a price tag on your tattoo if your over pop into a shop with a good idea of what you want and ask for a quote if your not but still are curious and want to get an idea you can call a few shops to get a ballpark price but be prepared to be very exact with what you want over the phone also don't be surprised if the shop just tells you to come in a lot of shops have a policy about quoting over the phone and won't do it  Tattoo About a Boy Supply and demand Typeface Best Buy Social rule The Adventures of Pete & Pete Insurance Microeconomics Economics Killian documents Theory of conduct Good Charlotte Scarification Friends Phoneme Screenplay Euro Little Britain The Apprentice 2 Jennifer Lopez Customs and etiquette of Japan Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Fable (video game) CPU cache Game show HTML element Taxi Driver Digital photography Avril Lavigne Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Unreal Short message service Mutual fund UK telephone numbering plan Britney Spears Tesco Inflation The Ashlee Simpson Show Web design Avenue Q Amy Dumas Electronic commerce International Phonetic Alphabet Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Vanilla Ninja Criminal tattoo Ra (board game) Paintball Fast bowling Socrates Jackass: The Movie Oz (TV series) RuneScape weapons Donald Rumsfeld Smallville (Season 4) Capitalism House of Leaves Angels in America Prices of production Determinism Michelle Branch Password Irezumi Capital accumulation Memento (film) Shaggy dog story Ann Coulter Thomas Carlyle Dial M for Murder Detroit Tigers Retailer Extreme Programming PNG Rose (Doctor Who) Wheel of Fortune Mark Calaway Garfield Species Irna Phillips Saint Peter Namie Amuro Cape Feare The Catcher in the Rye Tattoo You Urban sprawl PE ratio Mattress Bicycle lighting Brandy (entertainer) Shawn Michaels Milton H.

longboard skateboards does anybody ride and if so what is a good brand and it is better than traditional skateboarding sector is one of the oldest companies still making them they utlize a fiberflex system that renders the board practically unbreakable i could fold a foot one so nose met tail traditional long boards are made with a board so there is no flex and carving takes a lot of skill the fiberflex allows for higher speeds and better control you just have to get used to the up and down motion of the board traditional skateboarding street is complicated and takes a large amount of coordination park skating vert is even harder long boarding is easier and can act as a mode of transportation on campus or short distance  Skateboard Skateboarding trick Skateboarding Snowboarding Aggressive skating Motorcycle Windsurfing Kitesurfing Knife Equine conformation Bicycle Ski Hard disk Roller skating Monopoly (game) Kayak Bicycle lighting Golf club (equipment) Spacecraft propulsion World Industries Redundant array of independent disks Drill bit Car handling Indian Railways Street luge Stunt BMX Fixed-wing aircraft External ballistics Bubble Bobble Milton Keynes Rodney Mullen Golf Tribes 2 Milwaukee, Wisconsin CPU design Anatomical terms of location Diving Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Traumatic brain injury Fast bowling Transport for London Dog agility Violin Poker jargon LOVE Park Grand Forks, North Dakota Baroque chess Powell Peralta Passenger car Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Bicycle helmet Skate punk Pump It Up Tony Hawk's Underground Paragliding Tony Hawk Compiler optimization Floppy disk Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory X Games Nike, Inc.

do tattoos hurt how long is the healing time can i still play sports wk after please any advise would be great i'm debating on the decision i am thinking of getting it around my hip area or now my shoulder so any advise you can give would be fantastic thanks the pain varies with location and tolerance both tattoos on my shoulders had a dull sting and hurt more as the guy worked towards the backs of my arms lower back and feet are painful from what i'm told wherever the skin is thin or bones are involved it will hurt more of course tolerance is a factor too my friend at college has a half sleeve from his elbow to shoulder and he says it didn't hurt at all not sure if i believe that but that's not important now as far as healing time it's subjective location may affect that both of mine took a week or two to heal as long as you keep on using vaseline or lotion on it it should heal up in no time as far as sports it should be ok again location may affect performance but i don't think you'll have a problem hope this helps and have fun  Diving Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation Aerial (dance move) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Professional wrestling attacks Swimming Decompression sickness Pain Hip fracture Stomach cancer Tattoo Boxing Prostate cancer Massage Swingout Carpal tunnel syndrome Scoliosis Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Archery Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tai Chi Chuan Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Iliotibial band syndrome Orthopedic surgery Breastfeeding The Shining (film) Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Backstroke Professional wrestling aerial techniques Earring Stress fracture Guinea pig Osteoarthritis Kodocha Childbirth Fibromyalgia Repetitive strain injury Chester Bennington Alexander Technique Softball Shoulder Puberty Weight training Hip hop rivalries Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Leon White Replacement joint Psoriasis Sesshomaru Swimsuit Recumbent bicycle Doom enemies Sauna Sandy Koufax Punch (strike) Rod Stewart Minor Harry Potter Beasts Local anesthesia Reflexology Casualty lifting Chiropractic Diving suit Ninja Scroll Professional wrestling throws Chair Motorcycle Trish Stratus Blood on the Tracks Arm Osteopathy Humerus Meat Loaf Fancy rat Volleyball Nine Inch Nails The Death Gate Cycle Radiation therapy Straitjacket Alcoholics Anonymous George Michael Human anatomy Dyspareunia Herpes simplex virus Kurt Cobain Brassiere Suplex Side Characters (Xenosaga) Internal ballistics Shaggy dog story Angelina Jolie Dualism (philosophy of mind) Healing Factor The Invisibles Characters of Naruto Eczema The Venture Bros.

tattoo based on personality i'm working on a tattoo design for a close friend of mine he wants something that has personal meaning to him while we've run past the idea of doing his name i was thinking perhaps something to reflect his personality on the outside he seems like a real tough guy and he is tough but while he might seem mean to people who don't know him well enough he's actually really chill and laid back confident and always up for a good time he's also really sweet and caring and always there for you in a bind i was thinking some kind of animal to repersent this but perhaps you guys have better ideas i feel really embarrassed posting this here as i know he'll probably read this but i wanted some ideas because i've hit a road block an animal is a good idea a tiger or dragon maybe dragons represent strength and also symbolise protection it is a beautiful creature graceful mysterious and has excellent lines and textures that you can work with in your design think scales flaming eyes the long curvy shape of it's body i would run this idea past him if i were you otherwise ask him to be a little more specific good luck with your art  Dragon Booster Piccolo Junior Saga Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Tattoo Xiaolin Showdown YuYu Hakusho Social rule Monster Rancher monsters Shen Gong Wu Wood carving Humphrey Bogart Alignment (role-playing games) Predestination Characters of Naruto Team Fortress Classic Time Out of Mind Charmed Kender Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)

tatto removal how does it work does it work well how much does cost does it leave a scar http bmeink com remove html theres some pictures price though thousand atleast im guessing it depends on the colors mainly the laser has to match the wave lengths of the color which is extremely hard to do if the artist mixed colors to make their own its not a one treatment thing its going in over and over until its right black though thats the easiest color to get rid of so hopefully you have an all black tattoo  Tattoo Color Scarification Digital photography Scar Keloid CMYK color model Laserdisc Welding Laser hair removal Common Unix Printing System HTML Apple II family Coherence (physics) Gamut Space elevator Internet IPod CPU cache Fast bowling Drawing Nonlinear optics Bong Penis Laser applications Red-black tree Pottery Plasma display Extreme Programming Volleyball Negima Iron Plastic Modelocking Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis JavaScript Stereoscopy Uniform Resource Locator Arguments for and against drug prohibition Password cracking HyperCard Diamond enhancement Technicolor Bulk vending Inertial confinement fusion Wiki Color theory Normal distribution Dispersion (optics) HyperText Transfer Protocol Color blindness Black Mask (comics) Chess strategy and tactics Photography Atari 8-bit family Fischer Random Chess Thulium IP (complexity) Gravitational radiation Synthesizer Unicode and HTML Diamond E-mail spam Lighting Laser Laser printer Cross site scripting Cosmetics Mixed-breed dog Cascading Style Sheets Wassily Kandinsky Laser engraving Beretta 92F/FS Pump It Up Acne Dragon Booster Polarization Cheating in Counter-Strike Optical fiber Compiler optimization Isotope separation Epilepsy Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Glossary of graph theory Yu-Gi-Oh!

is it appropriate for a leg tattoo to be visible at an event such as a graduation party shower or wedding i've seen people at work office job leaving theirs visible however mine is bigger if that matters it normally doesn't bother me but i was just wondering if there was a certain standard nowadays thanks advice coming from girls who have visible tattoos would really help well i have tattoos one on each outer side on my lower leg above the ankle i don't cover those two up the others are strategically placed so i guess it would depend on how large the tat is i have seen females with tat's on their legs that are too large as in the whole outer lower leg since i cannot see your tat i guess you should ask a family member if you should cover it or wear pants vs a skirt dress if you tat is tasteful then don't worry about concealing it most females today have tattoos so i think it would be acceptable to reveal it i recently went to a wedding and i wore a dress no panty hose in fact i receive many compliments about my tat's i hope this helps  Undergarment Trousers Skirt and dress Tattoo Pantyhose Sento Avenue Q Black tie Suit (clothes) Stocking Bob Jones University Belly dance Kimono Social aspects of clothing Trailer Park Boys Kilt Culture of the United States Brassiere Aerial (dance move) Neutrino Combine (Half-Life 2) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Avril Lavigne Buttocks Buckingham Palace The Apprentice 2 Cowboy Heavy metal fashion Comanche Clothing Amy Dumas Hijab Figure skating Strap-on dildo Angelina Jolie One Piece minor characters Diving Eric Cartman Sauna Customs and etiquette of Japan The Marriage of Figaro Shorts Jeans Social rule __cole Polytechnique EastEnders Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Sin City Swimsuit Jackass: The Movie Gender role Mariachi Dead Like Me Vanilla Ninja Shirt Jon Secada God Emperor of Dune Great Teacher Onizuka The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Marilyn Monroe Questionable Content Professional wrestling holds Piccolo Junior Saga Trish Stratus Negima Nudity Lie Lawyer Politics of Hong Kong Professional wrestling slang Bicycle Equine conformation Jam (TV series) Canadian Armed Forces Diving suit Academia High-heeled shoe Leggings Fruits Basket We Belong Together Electrophysiology Laserdisc Culture of Fiji Sniper Geology of the Moon Characters in the Smurfs Waterworld Kurt Angle Kenny McCormick Paul Is Dead Kim Possible Breeches role Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Order of the Garter The Dalek Invasion of Earth Kodocha Cross-dressing Gurkha Contingent Phil Hendrie
