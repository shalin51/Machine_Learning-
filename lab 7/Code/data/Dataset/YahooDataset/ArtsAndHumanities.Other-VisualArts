how much would you pay for a custom commissioned sculpture such as a life sized bust my husband is an experienced sculpter with many years experience in special effects for the movie industry he no longer does special effects but does sculpting as a hobby in his spare time he would like to know if people are willing to pay for commissioned sculptures and if so how much i'm a professional portrait painter and i tell people my price for a portrait is regular people think for a minute and either say okay i think we could do that because they accept my price or they say it's a bit steep and we either haggle or not but i'll tell you some rich people are the cheapest s o b's imaginable lol i personally would pay anywhere from to for a bust of myself if i was totally thinking i was all that lol when people ask me why i'm so expensive i tell them because i'm a specialist because i have to pay my rent or mortgage just like everybody else because i have to charge for my materials and extensive time to do a good job you wouldn't think twice if your toilet was backed up to pay a plumber anything he asks to fix your toilet he just steps inside your door and he's charged you right then well look up plumbers in the yellow pages and there are to pages of plumbers depending on the city but look up portrait painters or sculptors in the yellow pages how many hundreds are there there aren't hundreds there usually aren't even one hundred they are more specialists than plumbers shouldn't they charge accordingly if you'd like some suggestions you may find some private citizens who want a sculpture bust done of themselves but if i were your husband i'd send my biz card and brochure along with a personal letter offering my sculpting expertise to places like cooperstown and sport halls of fame every year there are a couple of sports legends hanging up their gear and a bust of them could be commissioned by committee also ceo's and presidents of top companies special committees have a budget for special gifts hope this helps  Sculpture National Kidney Foundation Singapore Plame affair Wal-Mart Insurance Wood carving Make money fast Jacques Saly Dot-com Euro Amedeo Modigliani Gian Lorenzo Bernini Microeconomics Citigroup Price discrimination Money FairTax Taxation in the United States Bicycle Screenplay United Kingdom corporation tax Paintball Amway Health insurance Autograph Life insurance Hillary Rodham Clinton Baseball Hall of Fame Vehicle registration plate Public transport New York University Supply and demand Marathon (sport) Jam (TV series) Sears Holdings Corporation ITunes Music Store Artemisia Gentileschi Keynesian economics Food and Drug Administration Electronic commerce Lincoln Memorial Bulk vending Sin City Andrew W.

why does abstract art sell for as much as figurative art this has always puzzled me why does abstract art sell for as much as or more than figurative art whenever i go into an art gallery or art auction i'm always blown away by the price tag put on the abstract art there much of the work is very simple so much so that someone just starting out with art could have created it as an illustrator i've had to spend literally thousands of hours practicing to get my skills where they are today i find it disheartening to see abstract pieces selling for as much or more than pieces which obviously have years of effort and dedication behind them i feel it cheapens the artist's efforts to consider their work as equal is that wrong why is abstract art not cheaper interesting question i think part of the blame lies with the consumers of the art itself abstract art is seen as much more fashionable than figurative more traditional style painting so the yuppies are willing to pay much more even the academies traditionally a sort of mecca for all aspiring artists have become omewhat dated over the years also just because there is obviously years of dedication behind some of these figurative works it doesn't necessarily mean that there is little effort in abstract works just that it is less obvious i have to say however that some of the stuff nowadays is tripe to put it politely many of the winners of the turner prize are so worthless it's unbelievable  Wassily Kandinsky Labor theory of value Art Modernism Auction J.

do colors look the same to everyone does orange look the same to me as everyone else no and maybe after working as a 'colorist ' artist and designer i would say not we see colors via rods and cones in our eyes the rods color vision come in three types receptive to red green and blue every person has rgb cones that are triggered by boundaries of slightly different wavelengths so that everyone perceives the precise colors slightly differently giving each one a slightly different band width and intensity an extreme and solid example is colour blindness this informs us clearly that some people can have radically different perception of colors except that in most cases the differences are much smaller our life experiences and upbringing affects the clarity with which we see colours as no two people have the same experiences all people do view colours slightly differently for both genetic and historical reasons i know this is true as my son calls his green shirt his gray shirt and he is not color blind read http www humantruth info subjectivism html http www visualexpert com faq part cfaqpart html p  Color Color blindness RGB color model Color vision Eye CIE 1931 color space Retina Color theory Color space HSV color space Visual perception CMYK color model Synaesthesia Light Cascading Style Sheets Light-emitting diode Primary color Blindness Gamut Eye color Atari 8-bit family HTML element Horse HSL color space Stage lighting Web colors Television Color constancy Pottery Pixel Uniform Resource Locator Stereoscopy Color depth Philosophy of perception Green Subject (philosophy) Glass Autostereogram Rainbow Color Graphics Adapter Color temperature Resistor Monochromat Black (people) PNG Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Night vision Saturation (color theory) Georges-Pierre Seurat Nintendo Entertainment System Antenna (radio) S__CAM Dragon Booster Asperger syndrome Purple Species Cat Audiophile HTML HyperText Transfer Protocol Cognitive science World Wide Web White (people) Lighting Dog Sunglasses Dichromat Political colour Hair color Parallax Direct realism Blue Rayleigh scattering Geologic time scale Character encodings in HTML XML Camouflage Speed of light Transcontinental nation Human variability Dyslexia Grey Colours, standards and guidons Bicycle lighting Sensation Migration Period Diamond Lab color space Visual cortex Crayola Website Ebook Loudspeaker Abdullah __calan Color photography Visual system Psychosis False-color

how to make wheatpaste graffiti i see wheatpaste graffiti all over the internet and i wanted to be the first in my town to make one and paste it near city hall so how do you make then stencil and wheatpaste also what are good techniques in doing stencil graffiti ok so for real really here it goes so basically you need to aquire some flour either it be the traditional wheat flower or just plain old white flour it dont matter none really as long as you have flour white flour is ideal cause its cleaner looking wheat flour is a little more dirty looking then you need a plentiful source fo water a tap typically now heres how to mix it so you have some flour pour that shit into a bowl a glass one not that it matters but to give you some sorta reference so once you have what looks liek a decent amount of flour in there what you think will be good enough for the size of paper you wanna put up you need to slowly mix stir water around in there i say slowly because you wanna pour just enough in to get rid of all the chucky flour bits you will notice these whe nyou are actually doing it basically these chunky bits are compressed balls of untouch flour and they are gunna crack open in you final glue paste and thats no good so make sure you pop em' all basically you want a nice even mixture before it goes in the cookin' pot so stir it around until you get that now hurs hoe ta kook it so you go t your glass bowl filled with a nice even mixture of water and flour right right good so now get out a metal pot like one you would boil instant noodles or soup or hot dogs in and fill it up with water the more water you put in this put the thinner the glue with be but hte more you wil have and of course vice versa the less water you put in the thicker it will be the lesss you will have the science is comparable to watering down alcohol d so let that boil when its started to bubble then you can pour in the mixture and then you have to stir and stir good and stir for a long time you also at this point in time turn the burner on your stove down to simmer mode oh and by the way we are using the stove to coo kthis shit just so you know the consistency of th eglue when its done should be creamy a creamy glue like substance the colour of semen some people like to add sugar or corn starch after its done cooking thats up to you it supposed to make it stickier just a side note dont get yuorself down if this shit doesn't work on the first go it takes many times to perfect your own recipe or it could be just a bad batch at times i also suggest googling this topic as you will then discover many wasy to make it cause im still leanign the best way my self now timez for applicationz so you have a bottle of wheat paste oh i forgot when its done cookign you gotta put into some sort of container like a coffee pot or an empty paint can some thign with a lid that can hold near boiling temerature glue also let it cool before you apply it so your standing at a wall with your container of home brewed glue you should have brought with you an old paint brush or roller your image and some balls applications methods varry alot but depending on the surface you either want to first rub the paste on the paper it self and press it flat to the wall or you can rub the paste on the wall first and then press the paper flat on to that or if your a real keener you can rub it on both but thats onlyif your keen then once its on the wall you have to spread from the centre out more glue over the image thus deleting any air bubbles that may or may not exist under the paper then well then your done put the lid back on your container of paste put your brush in a plastic safeway bag so it dont gun an dry up on you and move to teh next spot you may now feel liek you accomplished sticking it to the man' congrats  Bread Coffee Plastic Japanese tea ceremony Casting Beer Ramen Drill bit Textile manufacturing German cuisine Soup Glass Flour Korean cuisine Ice cream Cuisine of Singapore Cantonese cuisine Idli Paint Yerba mate Russian cuisine Potato Jewish cuisine Bengali cuisine Wheatpaste Turkish coffee Cookware and bakeware Soap bubble Pancake Rum Food preservation Cajun cuisine Seismic retrofit Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of Malaysia Toilet Dumpling Dim sum Mattress Gas metal arc welding Breakfast Welding Sake Ammonia Cuisine of the Philippines Halva Explosive material Roux Peruvian cuisine Agar plate Campfire Pizza Comanche Risotto Gumbo Soldering Kitchen Poker jargon Tortilla Carnivorous plant Internal ballistics Beverage can stove Pasta Electrophysiology Fondue Surrealist techniques Acetic acid Glacier Solar power Printed circuit board Homebrewing Cuisine of Laos Mouse (computing) Phase (matter) Genericized trademark Shit Cuisine of Brazil Strap-on dildo Printmaking Fujian tea ceremony Wine Wok Fire extinguisher Steel Wine making

what size portfolio case after a few years in the graphic design field i'm in the process of updating upgrading my portfolio question is what size portfolio case do i use right now i have an x case since graduating from college now it has been advised that i get a smaller one but how much smaller considering i have a few posters and magazine ad campaigns ads per campaign what would be the ideal size i use a profolio that fits my x pages it's small enough to carry around and is not bulky at all any of my projects that are too big to fit posters t shirt designs etc i potograph or scan and show representations of them printed in x this size works perfect because that's the size most people are used to seeing and it makes your portfolio easy to pass around if you are in a panel interview and gives each interviewer more of a chance to have a personal experience viewing your portfolio  U.S. Electoral College Requirements analysis Widescreen Apple Macintosh IBM PC compatible Billboard (advertising) Drew Struzan Killian documents Floppy disk Graphic design Graphics Windows Vista Laptop Chartered Financial Analyst William Eggleston Manga Windows 2000 Firearm Product Lifecycle Management Single Transferable Vote CPU cache Opera (web browser) Sorting algorithm Winning Streak El Lissitzky Compact disc Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma USB flash drive F-16 Fighting Falcon Krag-J__rgensen M4 Sherman Digital photography M16 (rifle) Model (abstract) Equine conformation Government of Australia Appeal Anamorphic widescreen Statistical survey Redundant array of independent disks Spyware Performance poetry Advertising Apple IIGS Cascading Style Sheets Portable Document Format Super Size Me Cessna T-37 Plame affair RISC Cathode ray tube Circuit design Enterprise content management Stereoscopy Second Battle of the Atlantic Galileo spacecraft Atari 8-bit family Federalist No. 10 Tank The Price Is Right Privatization Yearbook Nintendo GameCube Quicksort Windows Server 2003 Undergarment DragonFly BSD IMac General Dynamics F-111 Linked list IPod Super Mario 128 Election File Allocation Table Flag of Hong Kong UTF-8 Species Extreme Programming Logo programming language Graduate school Experiential education Advertising agency Sudoku View camera Royal Assent Computer Astrophysics Data System Charles Haughey Campaign finance reform Hustler Magazine v.

how to reproduce a painting i am painting a commissioned illustration in the future i think i may want to reproduce it for sale what should i do with it before i turn the original over to the new owners this is not about who has the rights to it this is just about the physical method to reproduce it in the future what kind of company do i take it to lithograph thanks no body does lithographs anymore the new printing is done with large format digital printers colors one at a time on canvas or watercolor paper depending on the medium the art work was originally done on these are called gicless and are printed out in far better reproductive quality than ever before dpi in archival inks you want a x transparency made or get a digital scan done on a cruse scanner which is a large flat bet not a drum scanner it will cost you between for x scan this is what professional artist do and a square foot to print the art even if you have a transparency approx cost it has to be scanned to be reproduced and you will not get the accuracy of a cruse scan you can use a expensive digital camera with a high dpi rating and good lighting for a digital file also you are looking for a company that makes gicless like que imaging in houston texas or harvest productions in la the great thing about gicless is you can order one and take orders off of it and only worry about more if you sell it  Digital photography Image scanner Dots per inch Photography Konica Minolta Pixel Digital camera Traditional animation Television Drawing Inkjet printer Color Fax Computer printer Optical character recognition Dot matrix printer Digital rights management 2D computer graphics M.C.

is it illegal to draw something that's copyrighted and distribute sell it say i draw an anime character and distribute sell it to my friends and or other people would that be considered illegal because i didn't get the permission of the owner of the copyrighted character if that is illegal why can people draw copyrighted characters and sell them at anime conventions i'm confused yes it's absolutely illegal all of it it's only legal to distribute copyrighted material if you're not making a profit on any of it such as a literary piece that has been distributed for educational purposes anything that's been created if you created it an idea song picture illustration software poem or movie and you took the trouble to have it copyrighted and protected for you to sell exclusively and someone else copied your idea i think you would take legal action especially if they profited off your idea technically the people selling stuff at conventions that you see as apparently not having permission from the owner of these characters are engaging in illegal activity and if you purchase those items you are supporting them similar to purchasing a pirated dvd  Copyright Intellectual property Copyright infringement of software Copyright infringement Warez Digital rights management SCO v.

anyone out there with an art career i'm thinking of many different careers i want to work in a museum maybe as an art curator or maybe in an art gallery or even an art critic i just want to know if there is anyone out there who has one of these careers or something similar and maybe tell me a little something about it just be aware that the kind of work you are speaking of is not artistic but falls under management if you wish to pursue this career path management courses in college would be advisable just because you will be working in the arts do not make the mistake of thinking that you will be an artist or of the arts artists are creative types you will be seen as a bureaucrat and although you may meet artists and handle their shows and such they will always see you as an outsider a bureaucrat and never the twain shall meet if however you are interested in being an artist then the career path you have asked about might still work for you but you will probably not have enough time during your day to exercise any creativity as to being an art critic well it brings to mind a variation on an old saying those who cannot do criticize in short most critics love to tell others what they did wrong but rarely if ever do they have the stripes or the talent to do anything creative themselves  Art Scientology beliefs and practices Auguste Rodin Franz Boas Georgia O'Keeffe A Course In Miracles Bureaucracy Time Out of Mind Anthroposophy Curator Electronic Arts Outsider Art Rudolf Steiner Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood Copyleft Max Stirner C__line Dion Martin Sharp Leadership Surrealism Jiddu Krishnamurti Brian Eno University of Massachusetts Amherst One Tree Hill (TV series) Unconscious mind Stanton Macdonald-Wright Richard Hamilton (artist) Tony Bennett The Emancipation of Mimi Drew Struzan John Ruskin Delta Goodrem Yoko Ono Consensus decision-making Raphael Kitsch Children of Dune Reaction to Darwin's theory Modernism Madonna (entertainer) Social rule Carl Jung Past teachings of Prem Rawat Bloomsbury Group Objectivist philosophy Michael J.

is buying heat transfer paper to put pictures on t shirts any good what i mean is will heat transfer images last alot of washes if so how many approx i know you would have to iron the tshirt inside out inorder not to destroy the print what are the pitfalls what are the pros do you know i personally don't like it they rarely last more then a few washes and most brands are difficult to apply evenly since most household irons tend not to produce even heat on a flat surface my suggestion is to take a course on how to do silkscreening from home which some colleges offer you can probably find a guide on line somewhere your options are a bit more limited but at least it's more permanent and lasts longer  Screen-printing Drill bit Casting Tire Upholstery Gas metal arc welding Opportunity rover Sento Ironing Laserdisc Brewery Glass Tattoo Loudspeaker Drawing Sword making Social rule Japanese tea ceremony Etching Cookware and bakeware Magnet Stereoscopy Friction Movie projector Solar power Printed circuit board Iron Thermoregulation Printmaking Konica Minolta Compact disc Wok Anchor Education in the United States Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Snowball Earth American and British English differences Strap-on dildo Lionel Corporation Carnivorous plant Fluorescent lamp Central processing unit Security (finance) Internal ballistics Annuity Sulfuric acid Redundant array of independent disks Wind power Animal Crossing Cast iron Textile manufacturing Stove Topps Customs and etiquette of Japan Acne GIF Boat building Label Japanese toilet Table tennis Energy development Furnace Spark plug Bicycle lighting Digital photography Mattress Photography Cascading Style Sheets Rugby union positions Toilet Menstrual cup Privatization Nuclear fallout Basketball Spacecraft propulsion Inertial confinement fusion Money Nintendo 64 Computer printer Carbon nanotube Pentagram Single Transferable Vote Screw Equine conformation Fermi paradox Enterprise content management Hiberno-English Life insurance United States Postal Service TRS-80 Traditional animation Collecting fossils Economic inequality Fusion power IPod Panoramic photography GED Rail transport

how are prices determined for modern art i know that art is a matter of taste how are the prices set for paintings by contemporary artists that is little more than a colorful mess on a canvas to my untrained eye anyway i just don't get it prices can be in the tens of thousands for something that just doesn't seem to justify the sale price i don't know much about art admittedly so please enlighten me the value of the art was in the composition and the expression the painterly value the visual beauty of the colors and how they compliment one another the geometry etc basically set aside the idea that a painting needs to illustrate something and ask yourself is it pleasing to look at and maybe what is the artist trying to illustrate in abstract terms yes i think a lot of artists will just slap some paint on a medium call it art and sell it as the same because they can and classical training or some profound claim as to what is being portrayed is really what is being sold like that guy who covers a hotel room with cheese it's not profound it's not art it's just stupid but as long as someone is willing to pay for it then it's an art of some kind and maybe the artist is a con artist  Piet Mondrian Western art history Modernism Wassily Kandinsky Academic art Drawing Japanese art El Lissitzky Impressionism Rococo Labor theory of value Helen Frankenthaler Supply and demand Transformation problem Color Buddhist art Art forgery Graphics Neoclassicism Georges-Pierre Seurat Degenerate art Modern art Frans Hals Baroque Microeconomics Andrea Mantegna Visual arts of the United States Abstract art Photography European classical music Stanton Macdonald-Wright Diego Vel__zquez Outsider Art Symmetry Live 8 Comics Cubism Pablo Picasso Copyleft Francis Bacon (painter) Martial art Kitsch Time Out of Mind Michel Henry Music genre Normal distribution Modern dance Renaissance Lisp programming language Economics Richard Payne Knight Law of value Electronic Arts Mannerism Philosophy of language Painting Prices of production Abstraction Drew Struzan Action painting Australian Aboriginal art Chinese art Abstract expressionism Rendering (computer graphics) Romanticism Postmodernism French literature of the 19th century Gerhard Richter Surrealism Expressionism Christina Aguilera Graphic design Tensor Miguel de Cervantes Georgia O'Keeffe Nicolas Poussin Art of the United Kingdom National Gallery, London David Hume Artemisia Gentileschi American comic book Grammy Award Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Model (abstract) Paint National Kidney Foundation Singapore Mathematics Tokusatsu Max Beckmann Ocean's Twelve Online music store Modernism (music) Eug__ne Delacroix Janet Jackson Guy Davenport

bachelor's in fine arts what kind of jobs are available for me right after college would i make much as a art director in any kind of art occupation honey if you are pursuing an art career it is imperative that you stop thinking about what kind of job you can get with a bfa or a ba with an art major you need to focus on your art build a portfolio and a strong one at that if you need money get a job as a barista or give art lessons to kids or be a museum guard do whatever is neccessary but please do not fool yourself you did not go into art because of the money or because you thought you were going to get a show at gagosian as soon as you turned your tassel but because you love art if art is your passion your raison'detre make it the primary focus of your life obviously artists need money like everyone but find a way to make it that doesnt corrupt your studio practice i know this doesn't exactly answer your question but i know how hard it is to be a young artist and wanted to plea with you to think about your art practice first too many young artists give up because art isnt their priority ps start thinking aboujt an mfa  Emerson College Academia Theory of conduct Honey and Clover Art Education in the United States The Sims 2: University The Ashlee Simpson Show German grammar EastEnders Ocean's Twelve Master's degree Cliff Richard Enron Corporation A Course In Miracles Kodocha W.

which is more easier crochet or knitting in general i would say crocheting is easier in knitting if you drop a stitch it can run and mess everything up while if you drop the loop in crocheting you just pick it up if you are trying to decide what to take up it depends more on what you want to make something knit tends to be thinner and more comfortable so if you want to make a sweater knitting is probably better it is easier to shape things when crocheting so if you want to make stuffed animals crocheting is better  Textile manufacturing Crochet Textile manufacturing terminology Knot Lace-making Mattress Yarn Textile Undergarment Aran sweater Sewing machine Tatting Arts and crafts Velcro Highway 61 Revisited Leprosy Social rule Aran Islands Kippah William-Adolphe Bouguereau gallery Halting problem Cloth M__bius strip Lilo & Stitch Traditional animation Felt Chair Leather Stocking Strap-on dildo Equine conformation 2000 Australian Grand Prix Teddy bear Soap bubble Chopsticks Compiler optimization Shoelaces Carpet Spinning (textiles) Garfield Transportation Security Administration Parachute Suture Anorexia nervosa Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Derivative Vivian Stanshall T-shirt Repouss__ and chasing Anchor Punt (boat) Fair Isle Bicycle frame __mile Durkheim Welding Pancake Pantyhose The Adventures of Pete & Pete Windsurfing Cashmere wool Menstrual cup Wood Make money fast Shaggy dog story Bicycle Guitar pick Kayak L4 microkernel family Warrant Officer Brainfuck Placeholder name Kimono Pottery Hey Jude Blood (computer game) Compiler Domesticated turkey Knife Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Sin City Cardigan (sweater) Mess dress Sailing The Cider House Rules Casting Weezer Magic (illusion) Swarm Mr. Bean Energy development Glass Quake III Arena Lock picking Renormalization Twelve Swords of Power Combine (Half-Life 2) Dog training

does anyone know the value of a stromberg carlson tv set does anyone know the value of a stromberg carlson tv set im not an antique specialist im not sure of the year i looked but didn't see it listed it has three knobs on each side of the screen the screen itself is ovalized and it has a pullout record player it is in relativley good condition but it has just been sitting around collecting dust we plan on selling it at a garage sale so if anyone could give me a rough estimate or even info on the model im talking about it would be apprechiated thanks i am a long time television set collector and historian in order to know the value i would need the model number of the set which is usually stamped somewhere on the back of the tv stromberg carlson is a collectible set not all old tvs are in general collectors seek early sets pre war and immediate post war they prefer tvs with small screens and tabletop sets are sought after more than larger console sets there are exceptions of course one being early color consoles ' ' ' and sets with unusual cabinet design stromberg carlson sets can range from to more or less but that is just a rough guide there are many factors which determine value condition is always important sets do not have to work to be valuable coincidentally ebay auction number running now involves the sale of a stromberg carlson set you can watch that auction and see how it does antique tvs are sold regularly on ebay if you use ebay you have to decide if the sale will be for local pickup only or if you will hire a trucking company and ship it nationwide shipping a heavy console can cost more than the set is worth so most people try to sell their sets locally you will get the least amount of money via the garage sale method try ebay first they can give you exposure to all the tv collectors remember that you can protect your 'investment' and not sell too inexpensively by setting a reserve price in the auction good luck to you  Philatelic investment Ra (board game) Nintendo Atari 8-bit family Microeconomics Coin collecting Online auction business model Ford Motor Company Gramophone record $ale of the Century Management information system Atari 2600 Internet fraud Laserdisc Monopoly (game) Tax Electronic commerce Topps Television Dodge Charger Insurance Live 8 ITV Postage stamps and postal history of the United States Stamp collecting Autograph Computer and video games Leica Network effect Pickup truck Book collecting Google Mutual fund City of Heroes Gran Turismo (game) American Motors Slide rule Donald Trump Xbox IPod Neopets Xbox 360 Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 O scale Handheld game console MMORPG Commodore International Bond Nintendo GameCube Dot-com Cable television Timpani E85 Video game crash of 1983 Arbitrage Hot Wheels Life insurance Economy of Russia Wayne Corporation United States dollar coin Diamond Public policy Game Boy Extreme Programming Teletext Sears Holdings Corporation Bulk vending Advance fee fraud Law of value Hyperinflation Airline Inflation Nintendo DS Sinclair Research Ltd Regional lockout Surveillance Capital accumulation Amazon.com Bass guitar Sega Dreamcast Nuclear power Poker jargon Sega Ford Falcon The Smashing Pumpkins Labor theory of value Digital television EverQuest Banknote Commodore 64

any advice for selling paintings i work full time in an office environment however i spend whatever free time i have painting and now the winter will be starting i will have more time i do still life mainly however dabble in landscape i wanted to make some money our of my pictures and was wondering if there was anything i should know even tax wise etc advice anyone could give me to help me on my way i have sold two paintings to close friends so i know that they have some value although they are biased thank you work out how much time you spent doing the picture and times that by the amount you want to earn per hour then double it to cover the time you spent drawing tools wear and tear and time spent shopping for the materials now add the cost of materials to the picture ok so say i was selling a by canvas x in acrylics that took about hours work to finish x x now it used up about in acrylic paint and in clear archival spray varnish there were p worth of copper eyes and thread to hang it on and the canvas cost thus my material costs would be so i would add this to the and round up a bit to make of course if the picture was really good or more detailed than usual it would be reflected in the price having taken longer to complete the few i don't want to sell because i have an exhibition coming up and need work i add on an additional to the price but i also ask buyers if they would consider letting me use the work in my next exhibition for which you invite them to the varnishing party this is a good way to calculate price and you can see that the more expensive materials do very little to the final price so its always better to use the best materials you can buy of course is your starting price as soon as you get to exhibition spaces they will add a commission to this price thus you raise your price of all your work so you are not selling the stuff cheaper than the gallery i currently add to this price because that is the highest commission i have been charged however i do not exhibit too often and most rural galleries charge up to some london galleries can charge commission thus my painting is now if i were up to commission then it would be and should i ever get to cork st it would be a massive but fame eludes me lol avoid e bay you get no feed back like you would in a real gallery and only idiots buy art from a photograph the best place to start is a local restaurant you can offer to decorate the walls and if anything is sold allow the owner to take for taking the money have paintings ready to replace the sold pictures and offer to deliver the work in person so you can meet the new owners you need to invite them to your next exhibition which will have a party before hand they will be your best advert and printing invitations for them and their friends will ensure willing fans to your next event with a couple of good restaurant shows under your belt start contacting the local arts centres to arrange exhibitions you need about thirty pictures to do this and its worth having a few to replace sales with the arts centres will want to interview you and plan about six months ahead so when you have your first date go out and get somewhere to move the work onto in a neighbouring region art selling is about networking you need to get the next exhibition ready and start again keep all the good contacts in a little blue book and invite them to every new exhibition  Christo and Jeanne-Claude Microeconomics Francis Bacon (painter) Tax Mortgage Inflation MMORPG Futures contract Poker jargon Capitalism Advertising Supply and demand $ale of the Century Hyperinflation Wheel of Fortune Wal-Mart Drill bit Price discrimination Paint Life insurance Grace Cossington Smith Insurance UK Singles Chart Henri Cartier-Bresson Mid-levels ITV Paintball Vincent van Gogh Tire Oxford English Dictionary Japanese tea ceremony Andrea Mantegna Gross domestic product Georgia O'Keeffe Taxation in the United States Gmail Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus London Congestion Charge Brett Whiteley The Amazing Race Solar cell The Apprentice 2 Alex Ferguson Satchel Paige Bulk vending Digital photography CPU design Mattress Laserdisc Warren Buffett L.

artists how do you keep yourself motivated to work hard at your art all my life i wanted to paint and be a famous artist or at least a self supporting artist who could make a living at it last winter worked my butt off so hard to get ready for an important arts festival i had anxiety attacks and heart palpitation it might sound twisted but i was proud of myself for that the actual event was not outwardly successful though because i didn't sell a damn thing except some bracelets but i learned a lot from other artists and i'm really happy with what i'm working on right now i just don't understand why i seem to be dithering so much and can't seem to concentrate for more than half an hour at a stretch even though i have another arts festival coming up fast and not a lot of free time to get ready because i have to work full time in a store during the tourist season to make ends meet i wonder if other artists go through times when you feel kind of blase about it and how you pull yourself out of that last winter was a let down because i usually sell a few paintings every year and lots of prints hi and i hear you first put your stuff aside get out your favorite things the things that are forever that calm you make you smile and feel safe once you've got 'you' back head out to a bookstore or a gallery or a library and start flipping through great works of art or tear out photos from magazines or just colors that make you feel great just take a break get back to 'your place' and let everything go there's a book by julia cameron that you might want to read called 'the artist's way' as well as her silly and wonderful journal workbook she endorses writing in longhand pages every morning to unlock the blocks it's incredible the blocks just transport from your head to the page just remember that you're in charge not the block that you are amazing you have so much to give you can do this you know you can i wish you so much good luck  Jon Secada Blood on the Tracks The Ashlee Simpson Show Carl Barks Buddy Guy Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story The McGuire Sisters The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Current teachings of Prem Rawat Pitaten Queen (band) K' John Peel Milton H.

what is your favorite artistic medium paint watercolor clay photography etc the past few years i've gotten much better at painting and started off in acrylic i'm finally moving into oil painting which is somewhat of a harder medium for me because you can't really draw it out because oil paint is sometimes rather opaque but it goes on smoother is easily blended etc it's a challenge for me but one i definitely enjoy  Paint Acrylic paint Pastel Painting Traditional animation Georgia O'Keeffe Portrait miniature Drawing Polymethyl methacrylate Drew Struzan Jan van Goyen Plastic E.

do you despise minced whitefish editing i am drawing an analogy between tv programme editing and fish products on the one hand you get lovely long interesting substantial chunks that you can feast your eyes and metaphorically your teeth on and on the other you get just a mass of shredded little tiny bits of minced whitefish none of which last even as long as a full second and instead of giving you a visual area to explore at your leasure while you listen to the commentary you're battered by a blizzard of tiny cuts that make you feel like youve gone ten rounds with mike tyson after just a couple of minutes of the programme for the second time in two days ive had to turn the t v off because i cant stand being visually abused or visually raped by an intrusive editor is the minced whitefish editing style only suitable for the low attention span retard audience that watches mtv and should programmers sack talentless editors who just try to conceal their lack of talent behnd qikstyle yes i cannot stand that it is hard to watch they are trying to make it dynamic i suppose but are just not succeeding in other words their talent is still in hiding and they may not need to be hired by the hotshot companies until it comes out of its box a very interesting and true analogy  Visual Basic Have I Got News For You Drill bit Kylie Minogue Mike Tyson Boxing Extreme Programming Euphemism Sound effect BASIC programming language IBM PC compatible Time Out of Mind PNG Gospel of Thomas Milton H.

what is the role of visual communication in architecture i don't know if i fully understand your question but i will take a stab at it i guess my answer will be no worse for lack of details i think that in order to be appealing the work of an architect should visually communicate what was intended from the person having it built if i go to an architect to have my dream house designed but i really don't have an idea of what it should look like other than what i know it shouldn't look like the architect should be able to design a structure that is both what i want as well as what i don't want otherwise what is the point or you can ask yourself what do you think of when you see the sydney opera house that is one of the most recognized structures on earth for what it attempts to visually communicate to anyone who looks at it when i look at it i think of tall sailing ships with their masts of sails and when you look at its location i can't help but think the architect that designed it intended for it to visually communicate its connection with the sea to anyone who looks at it gone are the days when an architect simply built a box for people to either live or work in i think the demand for architects to visually engage the people for which they design is higher now than ever before and the sydney opera house is a perfect example in my opinion  Sydney Opera House Architect Theory of conduct Gothic Revival architecture Rigging Biblical inerrancy World's tallest structures Wardenclyffe Tower Naval architecture CPU cache Freedom Tower Le Corbusier Intelligent design Palladian architecture StarCraft Episode VI Theodicy Object-oriented programming Radio masts and towers Aphasia Tudorbethan architecture Plame affair Skyscraper Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Frank Lloyd Wright Irish Houses of Parliament Ludwig Mies van der Rohe Sailing Sail-plan Architecture timeline The Matrix Reloaded United States Capitol The Fountainhead Parliament House, Canberra Stalinist architecture Battle of Trafalgar Giles Gilbert Scott Frank Gehry Louis Sullivan Sydney Harbour Bridge Classical order Manifold Sydney Francis Petre Sailing ship Art Gothic architecture Dundas Square New Urbanism Robert Lawson (architect) McKim, Mead, and White Harry Seidler God Emperor of Dune Firefly (television series) Oscar Niemeyer Evangelicalism Ship Discordianism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Philip Johnson Extreme Programming A Course In Miracles Paul W.
