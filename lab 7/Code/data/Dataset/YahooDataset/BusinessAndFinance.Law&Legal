i am having trouble with my police oral boards any suggestions thank you troubles include quick thinking for senario type questions ok this is pulling from my th grade study skills but it works record yourself asking questions on a tape or mp player or you can write questions down on a card so you don't know what to expect and record yourself explaining the scenerio that way you can get a good idea of how your voice comes across and you'll get some experience thinking on your feet don't just think of the conversation in your head actually say the words your brain actually processes both differently and it reinforces the learning  Milton H.

are there any lawyers that i can talk to on thursday i got suspened for something i didnt do and wasnt aware of the problem theres word around that on monday when i got back from my suspension that they are going to fire me i know i didnt do anything and they dont have any grounds of firing me can something be done if i do get fired on monday you are more than likely in an employee at will state meaning you can be fired for anything as long as it doesn't violate any state or federal laws you say you didn't do it do what when they brought you into the office to suspend you did they discuss there investigative methods and how they determined it was you who did it unless you are the minority where you work only female or latina chances of pursuing anything is zilch the bigger issue here is collecting unemployment again since you do not mention what the suspension was over it is very difficult to say if you can even collect if you are being accused of theft it means they had grounds to terminate you and they can fight your claim on these grounds not to collect you can collect unemployment if you were terminated without cause if there is cause insubordination violence theft excessive lateness or absences etc your employer can request a protest form with anyone of these grounds and you can be very much denied by the department of labor unemployment insurance board unfortunately there is nothing you can do based on the little information you have offered  Plame affair Unemployment Treaty Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Capitalism Inflation Microeconomics Insurance Divorce Civil rights Article One of the United States Constitution Supreme Court of the United States Life insurance 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Wal-Mart Annuity Anarcho-capitalism Lawyer 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Tom DeLay Classified information Social Security (United States) Mediation American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Labour economics Trade union American individualist anarchism Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Article Two of the United States Constitution Democracy NAACP Minimum wage Human rights in the United States Bill Clinton Plame affair timeline Judicial review Iran's nuclear program Child support 1992 Los Angeles riots Ernst Z__ndel Israeli Arab Able Danger Capital punishment New Deal Michael D.

non compete can't work same profession for two years what in georgia if you are fired or if you quit and you have signed a very restrictive non compete clause agreement can you really not work in your chosen field in the city you live i can see the company not wanting you to take their business clients or take trade secrets but to not even let you take another job in your same career is this really legal before the agreement is signed what can be done to work with the employer to lighten up the other answer is right on but i might add one more thing state laws vary from state to state but one common theme among non competes is that they can't be so restrictive so as to keep someone from making a living so even though it is a legal and binding agreement often employers push the terms to be borderline legal and sometimes overboard in hopes they don't get challenged if you are in a specific niche industry in which your skills are not easily transferable then you might have a chance however employers also know that when it comes down to it it often becomes a game of who has the deepest pockets which is usually the employer some of the areas besides a niche industrustry that are often successfully challenged by employees are geographic region i e within a mile radius might be reasonable but not an entire state the timeframe of years could be restrictive in some get a referral to a good attorney and suck up the consult fee if it's something that you really might want or need to challenge at some point whatever you do don't get some crackpot attorney who dabbles in employment law good luck  Intellectual property Paralegal Contract Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Lawyer Plame affair Trademark Article One of the United States Constitution Copyright Poker jargon Attorney at Law Mediation Software patent debate Treaty Public domain Australian constitutional law Same-sex marriage in the United States Exploitation Apple Computer Free trade Arbitration World Chess Championship Same-sex marriage in Canada Digital rights management Trade union Trade secret Notary public Legal research Abortion in the United States Trust (Law) USA Stanley Cup Immigration to the United States Government of Australia International Criminal Court United States Postal Service Non-disclosure agreement Quizbowl Patent attorney Juris Doctor Volleyball Software license Guild Copyleft Unlawful combatant Education in Portugal Patent Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Construction Karl Rove Life insurance Same-sex marriage Supreme Court of the United States Game programmer Probation officer Alex Ferguson Charter of the French Language Separation of church and state Offshoring Kyoto Protocol Spam (electronic) Pretty Good Privacy Professional wrestling match types Royal Assent The Amazing Race Privatization Airline Assignment (law) Charter school Barrister Minimum wage Microsoft California government and politics Ty Cobb Tort reform Strategic management Polyamory National Football League Expert system Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Classified information Apprenticeship North American Free Trade Agreement Breastfeeding Appeal Judicial review Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Leasing Marriage Domain Name System Copyright law of the United Kingdom Amateur radio Mental retardation Ultima Online Team Fortress Classic Publishing DVD Inheritance (computer science)

can a employer legally deduct your lunch break from your pay my employer deducts our lunch break from our pay so instead of getting paid for hours per day we get paid for is this legal and if not whom do i need to contact i've never heard of this before my state is north carolina thanks remember the saying there's no such thing as a free lunch i'm sorry to say that's your answer there are rules that your employer has to follow that say when they have to give you a break but there's nothing in the rule book that says you have to get paid for that break for example when i worked for an insurance company back in the mid 's we worked an hour day with a minute lunch break each day now our salary was based on a hour week so our lunch breaks were unpaid then when i worked for the federal government one of their agencies we were paid for a hour week but we actually worked an hour day or a hour week again our minute lunch breaks were unpaid the key is are you paid a yearly salary or are you paid an hourly wage if you're paid a yearly salary it really doesn't matter if you get paid for lunch or not since you get a salary since you get paid by the hour you have to look at it the other way your boss is deducting that half hour's pay because you didn't work it right in actuality it should never have been recorded in the first place since you did not work it your time worked should have been recorded as hours not correct okay bear with me one more minute please does your employer by their putting hours down first does it give you an advantage or does it disadvantage you here's what i'm trying to say a by their putting down you worked hours is more money going into your fica account b by their putting down you worked hours is more money going toward federal or state or local income taxes c by their putting down you worked hours instead of is more money being taken out for anything else understand what i'm getting at if you boss if putting down instead of it may in fact provide an advantage to you or it may in fact be a disadvantage to you ken noto  Taxation in the United States Microeconomics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Life insurance Unemployment benefit Gross domestic product Minimum wage Annuity 401(k) Wal-Mart Child support Insurance Compensation of employees National Insurance Flat tax Progressive tax Productive and unproductive labour Student loan Blackjack FairTax Health insurance Surplus value Air traffic controller Anarchism and capitalism Day care Working time Payroll Salary Publicly funded medicine Reaganomics National Football League School choice Surplus labour Supply-side economics Trade union Income trust Economic inequality Labour economics Labor theory of value Salary cap Labor-power Education in the United States New Deal Tax protester Class struggle Ken Jennings United States Postal Service Education in Romania George W.

my question posted earlier about the old bag retiring i want to advise everyone who was ugly to me the entire situation so that maybe you would understand where i am comming from this woman is very mean with regards to talking trash about other co worker lots of stuff thats not true she makes me do alot of her work for her and at the same time taking the credit for it when the boss is not going to be there she intentionally comes in hr sometimes hrs late now before you start judging me you should have all the facts thank you i just read both of your posts and as an hr director consultant trainer i'm going to offer you some constructive feedback and you can choose to get upset or you can choose to take it for what it's meant to be help keep in mind that it's your choice first and foremost it's also your choice in how you deal with this person how you refer to this person how you control your own emotions etc you can't blame the old lady for your own bad attitude you may be legitimately frustrated but it's still your choice in how you deal with it you are very defensive to everyone who judged you and didn't have all of the facts yet you are the one who posted a question asking for advice and failed to provide all of the facts to begin with at the same time being very derogatory in reference to someone's age it's attitudes like that in which we can't read your mind but you poorly choose your words are why people like me are brought in to clean up your mistakes in a harassment situation whether you care to admit it or not or whether you realize it or not that is exactly what you are creating if you are referring to this person in such a manner in the workplace as one poster stated you don't have mandatory retirement however there is age discrimination and protection for older workers and you could legitimately place yourself and your company in a position to get sued please take that very seriously so when you carelessly throw out comments like you did in your original post and that's not judging you you were careless in your writing and you don't back up your statements with fact vs emotion then people are going to respond as they did i'm not going to make assumptions about your work environment but the other thing i will caution you on is that in addition to age disrimination harassment lawsuits there are also what are called constructive discharge lawsuits in which someone quits because the work environment is so hostile that any reasonable person in a similar situation would be forced to quit you may think i'm referencing that as an option for you but i'm not when i say that i'm talking about your asking how you can get rid of the other person even if someone is treating you poorly you treating the other person poorly in return won't help the situation and could as one other poster responded cost you your job another thing to keep in mind is if this person is established and gets away with this stuff your boss may be aware of it and accept it in exchange for the loyalty blackmail whatever you won't know the reasons there may be nothing you can do about the situation and you might need to look for another job if it bothers you that badly i say this from experience i've been the employee co worker and even as the hr director in organizations that had that same kind of person and there was nothing i could do about it sometimes you just have to suck it up however i will suggest that there are some resources that may help you in dealing with the situation a little more effectively if you want to continue working there you have got to make the decision though to be the bigger person in this situation and remove the name calling age references etc from your vocabulary there are two books that are easy to read and considered some of the best resources for dealing with interpersonal work relationships they are written by a group of business professionals and there are training seminars all over the country using their material they also have a website in which they have an email newsletter in which people submit their questions to the author and get professional feedback vs yahoo answers feedback and you could possibly get some great help by seeking them out but again you will have to rephrase your question with facts basic respect to get any respectable answers if you are open to reading the books the books themselves could possibly give you the tools you need to learn how to approach your boss about this person or perhaps how to approach this person directly or even how to adjust your behavior so as not to let this person get to you so much the books are crucial conversations and crucial confrontations and the website is www vitalsmarts com the premise behind these books is that if people knew how to properly have crucial conversations especially in business how much more successful we could be as people but also the companies themselves that benefit a classic example is with enron worldcom arthur anderson assuming you are familiar with their downfall people in those companies knew there were things wrong but no one knew how to effectively speak up and have those conversations that could have possibly saved those companies more than you asked for or wanted i'm sure but hopefully you can take it for what it's worth as an attempt to help you figure out a solution to dealing with this situation  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Alexander Technique Ethics Theodicy Scientology beliefs and practices God Emperor of Dune

does it really matter if i get my paralegal certificate from an aba approved school or is it all the same if i get it online i know a person doesn't have to have a certificate but i know it helps therefore i am wondering if it is worth the extra bucks and commute time to go through an aba approved paralegal program or if getting the certificate is just as good if it was done online at some random school i work for one of the biggest law firms in the detroit area and i can tell you unequivocally that a certification from an aba approved program carries much more weight than a certification from a non aba approved program btw online degrees are at the bottom of the list they're literally not worth the paper they're printed on aba accreditation means the program has been reviewed by a panel of lawyers and the program has met with their approval as to the skill set a paralegal specialist requires in order to be a useful part of a law office so if an applicant comes in and has an aba approved paralegal program on their education record they know there is a basic set of skills this person already has that will not have to be taught or re taught and that saves the firm time and money by contrast a person who comes in with any other type of paralegal certification may have those basic skills but then again he she may not law firms don't like to take chances on people like that so the person from the aba approved program wins every time  Paralegal Juris Doctor Lawyer Certification Education in Portugal No Child Left Behind Act City and Guilds of London Institute Law firm College admissions Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Nurse Education in Australia A-level Software engineering Graduate school Librarian Education in Malaysia Barrister Information Technology Infrastructure Library School counselor San Antonio Spurs UCAS Boy Scouts of America Education in Hong Kong GED Homeschooling Harriet Miers Law School Admissions Test Type certificate Apprenticeship Copyright law of the United Kingdom Education in the People's Republic of China Notary public Motion picture rating system Architect Law of the People's Republic of China Linked list Church of Christ Education in the United States Attorney at Law Physician James Hahn John Edwards Appeal OpenDocument Kaplan Wheel of Fortune Poker jargon AmigaOS Economic inequality Teacher Education University of Houston Ethical challenges to autism treatment Constitution of Ireland Winning Streak Associate's degree Community college Literacy Pilot certification in the United States IB Diploma Programme High school Grade (education) Japanese tea ceremony Accountancy Censorship in Australia Profession Tai Chi Chuan Tripartite System Sheepshead Trusted computing Supreme Court of the United States School accreditation ISO 9000 Organic certification Money Patent H-1B visa Athletic trainer Classified information Hacker Indiana Pacers Bailiff Legal aspects of transsexualism Trademark Bumiputra Identity theft Public domain Pinball Dublin City University University of Hawaii at Manoa Caldwell College Legal system of Hong Kong New Hampshire Supreme Court Act of Parliament Coalition Provisional Authority

legality of a labor issue my fiance works for a company that only hires employees as contractors as of this week they have started fining any one who doesn't show up for work per day or per missed job on the route they would have gotten had they shown up which ever is more is this legal we live ohio since labor laws may differ from state to state thanks if you can help this is illegal to the point of being hilarious if your fiance is truly an independent contractor ic he has a contract to provide services to the company does that contract specify any sort of penalty for non performance if not the company is out of bounds to attempt to assess one since the company appears to be attempting to institute disciplinary action against an ic that makes them a co employer your fiance could theoretically sue under the basis that he is actually a bona fide employee of the company and thus is entitled to all of the beneifts of an employee group health coverage profit sharing regular pay increases and so on how are the fines being assessed are ics supposed to write a check to reimburse the company see paragraphs above or is it being withheld from their check without a specific written agreement docking a billing invoice for an ic or a paycheck for an employee is generally not legal btw if he is being paid as an employee payroll taxes deducted receiving a w rather than a at year end etc he really is not an ic if the company is just calling him an ic in order to avoid paying benefits etc that's also illegal pretty much this is a black hole of illegal activity you can report these folks to the dept of labor at www dol gov where you can also find more info about wage and hour law the irs are the folks who govern ics look on www irs gov under the factor test for ics to see if your fiance meets the requirements also if the company for which he contracts is public they should have a hotline to report corporate malfeasance and financial wrongdoing required for most public companies under the sarbanes oxley act thanks for this amazing example of corporate stupidity i'm truly in awe  Taxation in the United States Wal-Mart FairTax Social Security (United States) Tax Insurance Trade union United Kingdom corporation tax Microeconomics Minimum wage Contract Publicly funded medicine Life insurance Flat tax Affirmative action 401(k) Civil rights United States labor law Child support Corporation Unemployment benefit Sarbanes-Oxley Act Unemployment Accountancy Payroll Health insurance United States Postal Service Lloyd's of London ITV Annuity Church of Scientology Apprenticeship Copyright Article One of the United States Constitution Credit card Corporate governance H-1B visa 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Labor theory of value Compensation of employees Arbitration Enron Corporation Workers' compensation Domestic partnerships in California Tax protester Financial audit Salary cap Business ethics George W.

is my boss obligated to pay me the entire two weeks if he lets me go early after i had resigned week before i gave my current boss my two weeks notice resignation about two weeks ago he decided that on wednesday of the last week i was supposed to be there that he was going to let me go i am salary so not only did he not pay me for thursday and friday but on wednesday since i got let go at am he only paid me for four hours of the day does anybody know if any of these two situations were handled incorrectly or maybe even illegaly by my boss should i waste my time with hiring an attorney i feel i am owed money at least for the day since i was salary there is no obligation for a company to pay an employee through a notice period the notice period is a professional courtesy only most employers these days are at will which means that the employment relationship can ben ended by either the employerr or the emploeyr at any time for any reason with or without notice as a salaried exempt employee you are paid for full days that you work and are exempt from overtime your boss was correct to pay you only through wednesday however he failed to pay you for the entire day he is not obligated to pay you past your termination date so i disagree with the other poster who indicated that you must be paid the remainder of the week or pay period you cannot be salaried and also be paid by the hour it's all day or it's wrong if you hire an attorney they won't be able to get you very much except the loss that you sustained hours' pay and they will take of that most attorneys won't waste their time you could file a complaint with the dol www dol gov but those take a long time to get resolved or you could simply write a letter to your boss indicating that you know you were paid improperly for your last day of work because you are paid on a salary basis and asking for the additional four hours of pay what's the worst he can do say no good luck  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Wal-Mart Salary cap Contract Fasting Working time Salary Tax National Football League Killian documents Video game developer Unemployment Great Depression Daylight saving time Hebrew calendar Saturday Night Live 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression George W.

consequences of false reference my daughter was given a false reference from her care home employer just after she had worked her notice and just as she was about to start work at a different care home which was closer to her home subject to a satisfactory reference from her former employer the reference was false untrue and was understandably unacceptable to the new employer and has resulted in her now being out of work and unable to even claim jsa i understand from a previous post that it is possible to sue who should she sue the care home or the manager who wrote the reference how and where does she commence proceedings thanks in advance for any replies uk she needs to find an employment solicitor in her local area i'm not familiar with uk law in the us it is indeed possible to sue an employer for providing a false reference if nothing else it would appear that she has a claim for slander if she is able to prove that the accusations made against her are untrue again in the us she would sue the care home and the manager would be a named party to the suit the manager could have personal liability in addition to the care home sorry i can't be of more assistance good luck  Slander and libel Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tort Appeal Lawsuit Divorce SCO-Linux controversies Sovereign immunity Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 16 Domestic partnerships in California Silvio Berlusconi Evidence (law) Insurance First Amendment to the United States Constitution Estoppel Workers' compensation Stump v.

when to start a family after law school i'm thinking about going to law school after i graduate i will gradutate from college in may i'll be barely then would go directly to law school graduate from there when i'm around i'm conflicted about when i would start a family if i did this i plan on getting married after college and would likely not start a family until after law school i know that the first few years after law school are tough however i'm not planning on being a big time lawyer or even a trial lawyer i'm interested in the behind the scenes research area would likely work at a business or small firm near where i live so even though it would still be tough it won't be quite as cut throat as what i've been hearing major firms in nyc are like lol do you think it is possible to have a family a few years after law school my question is mainly for lawyers or people with direct experience not second hand info about someone who did something and it was hard there are many people who have families while their in law school and soon thereafter some people are professionals who decide to go back and get their degree but already have a husband and kids others are like you and want to get married young so yes of course you could have a family i don't see you having a family after law school any different than you having a family as an accountant at a major firm or as any businessperson trying to make it it will require lots of work and if your spouse works too it will require a nanny or daycare but it can work you just have to make sure not to neglect your child ren because they are living extensions of yourself and while your job can be replaced they can't good luck  Lawyer Law firm Juris Doctor Law school Divorce Attorney at Law Paralegal EastEnders No Child Left Behind Act Graduate school Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus John Edwards Law & Order Hillary Rodham Clinton Architect Bernard Williams W.

lawyers especially i'm thinking of entering the law field as a career i'm going to be a junior in high school this year so it's time to seriously consider colleges and careers i would really like to be a lawyer it seems so exciting and i'm really interested in law but there's some things that worry me a lot about that my friend's dad is a lawyer and he has to work serious overtime and go on tons of business trips and i would want time for my family in the future i also kind of a tv vision of the job in my head and i know that's not completely accurate so my question is what's the job really like if you are a lawyer do you like your job what do you like and dislike about it what do you do on an average day thanks in advance i am a lawyer and have my own employment law firm in the suburbs of chicago www lawyer employees com i wanted to be a lawyer since th grade but because of family finances i did not go to law school until i already had a career i love my job my business and especially my profession because i own the firm i make my own hours yes there have been hour weeks but there have been hour weeks also that is one good thing about being a lawyer you can find a firm or go to a corporation that has limited ot once you get that license and experience you can find that perfect fit as a lawyer who represents employees i do what is commonly called transactional work that means a short time with the client i appear at hearings in administrative agencies like the eeoc obtaining unemployment benefits and before federal courts representing government employees each day is different which is something that i enjoy sometimes it is like what you see on tv with all the rushing around and going in front of strict judges but most time it is not as a lawyer you are on the job even in social events your profession makes a difference you get asked legal questions by friends and family and are expected to come up with a quick answer negatives are that the salary is no where near what you see on tv latest aba research says average salary for lawyers is if that sounds like alot it isn't that is what my law school charges per year the other negaitve is that your profession is always being made fun of and ridiculed because the profession like all professions has a few bad apples in it it becomes very frustrating when you know that your practice is ethical to have your profession run down especially by family i agree with the other poster about finding a job in a law firm to test the waters remember there are places other that law firms that employ lawyers most coporations have lawyers in their human resources department to keep hiring and firing legal corporations may have general counsels in house counsels compliance counsels for companies that must comply with certain laws like insurance companies do and senior or executive managment who are attorneys but do not practice law many business consider a law degree as a great asset look at www abanet org that is the american bar assoc website they have a section for those thinking about becoming a lawyer if you are blessed with the calling to become a lawyer then go for it if at all possible go into law school right after college good luck  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Juris Doctor Attorney at Law Barrister Law firm Law school Microeconomics Corporate governance Harriet Miers Karl Rove Graduate school Wal-Mart Education in the United States Unemployment Michael D.

i was convicted of a misdemeanor of battery in florida can an employer not hire me because of that i live in illinois and cannot find a job because of a domestic violence charge in florida over years ago i know i have to state that on my application but i've applied for over jobs and have not even had a bite if i don't put this down and they do a background check then i'm going to look like a liar what can i do the answer to this question is unfortunately yes an employer can make the existence of a prior misdemeanor conviction a grounds for refusing you an offer of employment unless your state has a statute that prohibits such refusal on such grounds furthermore knowingly falsifying any information on an employment application is always grounds for termination when such falsehood is discovered what you have to do is find an employer who does not ask this question or who does not care that you were convicted of domestic violence you may also seek executive clemency from the governor of florida and have your conviction expunged but you have to deserve that clemency and each state governor has his own rules about to whom to grant such clemency pardon amnesty etc and why to grant it  Pardon Plame affair Capital punishment in the United States Appeal Article Two of the United States Constitution Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Same-sex marriage in the United States Alberto Gonzales Judicial review Lawrence v.

law career question what is the difference between a paralegal and a lawyer and what is the difference in pay thanks job description paralegal busy lawyers often find that there is not enough time to do all of the research and preparation required for each case to help overcome this problem lawyers often employ the services of paralegals paralegals assist lawyers they do the preparatory research for hearings trials closings and corporate meetings they look up anything relevant to the cases on which they work they prepare legal documents and they might even assist lawyers during trials perhaps preparing legal arguments however unlike lawyers they are not permitted to appear in court alone they are also not permitted to set legal fees or give legal advice the lawyers for whom they work assume all responsibility for their work paralegals duties vary depending on the type of employer for example paralegals working for civil litigators spend most of their time drafting and filing documents in the field of family law they might draft pleadings and motions and calculate child support those working for a corporation s legal department will assist in the preparation of financial reports employee contracts and employee benefit plans often a paralegal specializes in only one area of the law such as labor law bankruptcy or real estate job description lawyer if you are interested in justice enjoy arguing about important issues or feel that you would like to help people learn about their rights then you might consider becoming a lawyer most of us are familiar with tv shows like law and order that dramatize the lives of lawyers but that s only part of the picture in fact most lawyers spend a lot more time reading writing and researching than they do in court there are also many types of lawyers some work for the government and prosecute people accused of crimes others defend people accused of crimes both of these types of lawyers are known as criminal lawyers other lawyers focus on business related matters like taxation commercial transactions and the incorporation of new companies generally called corporate lawyers their work involves fewer court appearances and more negotiations and careful reading of contracts some lawyers specialize in litigation of non criminal matters such as wrongful dismissal suits and negligence actions lawyers living in small towns may practice in all of these areas whatever their specialty lawyers share many of the same basic duties one of their main tasks is advising clients of their legal rights responsibilities and potential problems they also represent clients in negotiations and in front of courts and tribunals researching rules regulations and previous cases is another major part of their job much of their time is spent preparing legal documents like contracts and wills it s their job to make sure that the wording is clear and covers all eventualities so that conflict won t arise in the future in all these situations lawyers are responsible for interpreting the law and applying it to specific situations they use their knowledge of the law to help their clients and ensure that the legal system works properly wages these are from my area it's different in everyone but you can see the big difference occupation paralegals and legal assistants entry wage hourly annual median wage h a experienced wage h a occupation lawyers entry wage h a median wage h a experienced wage h a good luck hope this helps  Law firm Trade union Tort reform Microeconomics Slander and libel Insurance Government of France Tax Scots law Legal system of Hong Kong Due process Corporation Jury Intellectual property Supreme Court of the United States Estoppel Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Adversarial system Australian constitutional law Civil rights Jury trial Constitution of Ireland Cour de cassation Minimum wage Corporate governance Corporate personhood Economic inequality Judicial functions of the House of Lords International law Government of India SCO-Linux controversies Probation officer Public domain Ethics Same-sex marriage in Canada Capitalism Keynesian economics Fathers' rights 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Trademark Theory of conduct Treaty Legal research Enron Corporation Leasing Democracy Unemployment Equal Protection Clause Trust (Law) USA Taxation in the United States First Amendment to the United States Constitution Judicial review Administrative law of the United States Tom DeLay Life insurance International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict Negligence Medical malpractice Article One of the United States Constitution Free trade American Civil Liberties Union John Edwards Tax protester Inflation Construction Copyright Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 7 Enterprise content management SCO v.

what is considered good cause to quit a job and receive unemployment i work for a major bank involved in the mortgage business i am in a sales position paid by commission only no salary just a draw against comission each month our industry is in turmoil with wall street pulling all our capital funding effectively my company has cut of their products the products left to sell are minimal as many remaining products aren't even useful in my area due to property values orange county ca our pay contract was altered earlier in the year so our pay adjusts quarterly depending on how the market is doing now the market is gone i suggest there will be a major cut i cannot make any money in this environment can i quit and go back to school while collecting unemployment i imagine i'll get fired anyway soon due to lack of production but it's really out of my hands a week before this market disruption they tried to make me sign a forward agreement on my production which i refused now it's impossible to hit the quota contact your state's employment office to find out what applies to you in your situation and or consult an attorney who specializes in such unemployment insurance matters in the meantime here is some possibly useful information that can help you better discuss your situation with your attorney http ask yahoo com html federal unemployment insurance is administered by individual states and territories the rules including eligibility how much money you get and how long you receive it all vary according to the aarp you're usually not eligible for unemployment benefits if you quit your job but if you show good cause for leaving you might receive benefits the problem is that states define that term differently most states consider good cause something the employer has done to cause you to quit your job but some states say that leaving for personal reasons like being a caregiver for someone who is ill is sufficient enough to receive benefits if you quit due to a workplace situation then before applying for unemployment benefits you must show that you have asked your employer to correct the situation also it's important to show that the situation would cause any reasonable person to quit because benefit eligibility depends on where you are it's best to contact your state's employment office to find out what applies to you in your situation unemployment benefits good cause quit if you quit your job you are usually not eligible for unemployment benefits but you may be eligible if you quit for good cause there are big differences in how the states interpret good cause in a few states you may still be eligible for unemployment benefits if you quit your job for a personal reason such as caring for a family member who is ill in most states good cause must be something that the employer does to justify your quitting your job when you apply for unemployment benefits based on one of those reasons you must show that you have asked your employer to correct the situation you must also show that the situation would cause any reasonable person to quit http www larcc org pamphlets benefits work rights uc when quitting htm you may quit for good cause attributable to your employer attributable to your employer means you quit because of problems related to your job these reasons may include unsafe working conditions a job which is damaging to your health with medical proof the job must either cause your illness or make your medical condition worse a change in working conditions that is harmful to you for example you may be asked to work longer hours take a reduction in pay or have to do very different job duties your employer broke your original contract for example your employer did not give you a pay increase that was promised in your contract in addition before quitting you must talk with your employer about why you want to quit you must give the employer a chance to work out the problems unless you can show it would have been useless to have done so for example you may have told the employer about the problem many times and the employer did nothing about it explore all other alternatives to quitting such as taking a leave of absence you must show that quitting was the only reasonable thing to do you may also quit for certain other reasons and still get benefits you quit to care for a seriously ill spouse child or parent who is living with you as documented by a licensed doctor however you may be eligible only as long as you are available for some employment for example you are available to work during different hours or you are again able to work because you now have care for the family member during working hours you cannot collect benefits if you are not available to work you quit because you lost your transportation other than your own car to get to and from work and there is no other reasonable way to get to work you quit to protect yourself or a child living with you from domestic violence you may be asked to show that you tried to keep your job the department of labor dol calls this making reasonable efforts to hold onto your job reasonable efforts could include asking for a transfer or leave of absence before you quit the dol will look at each case individually you quit a job within days of starting the job because it turned out to be unsuitable reasons a job may be unsuitable include a commute that was too long or where the job put at risk your health safety or morals which usually means you had to travel between a m and a m if you wait until after days to quit you will be found to have agreed to the unsuitable condition and be unable to get unemployment compensation exceptions are sometimes found even if more than days have passed depending on the circumstances for example you may have good cause for quitting if you made repeated complaints about a workplace situation or if the employer promised to fix the situation but still failed to do so in addition you must be able to explain why the job is unsuitable you must be able to explain how the conditions of the job caused you problems you must tell your employer about the problem and try to work out the problem before quitting unless it would have been useless to have done so you may quit and still get unemployment compensation if you leave part time work to accept full time work

is it a wise career move for lawyer to leave trial practice for an in house counsel job that pays higher now ive been a lawyer for and a half years ive been doing trial work from the start of my career days ago a big company called me and offered me a job as an in house lawyer no trial work just consultation and paper work it pays higher than my salary as a trial lawyer in my current law firm headed by my dad should i accept the offer and leave trial work indefinetly ya know what they say just because its bigger doesn't mean its better i'm not saying that you shouldn't take the offer but you should consider all of the different circumstances that surrounds the job more money yes more work hows the hours compared to what you have now and never forget what comes with big companies interoffice drama and its very impersonal but in all you've got to look at it this way are you going to be happy pushing papers behind the scene instead of being in a court room fighting for a case your still fairly new at being an attorney and still have got loads to learn and who better to teach you that your dad maybe after you get a few years under your belt you can move on to something else besides if they want you now they'll want you later because you'll have more experience i would speak to your dad about what he thinks you should do he's gonna know the law world better than you and he'll only be looking out for your best interest good luck  Lawyer Attorney at Law Law firm Plame affair Court system of Canada Paralegal Appeal Divorce Barrister Leo Frank Economic inequality Karl Rove Graduate school Michael D.

i want to know my future my name is shilpa rathi my date of birth is i have finished my b com in the year then i searched for a job but i didn' got any job then i started my mba finance correspondent from symbiosis then also i searched the job but in vail then in the year i got married then i got the job but my sister in law said no then we moved to gurgaon after year then i became pregnant now i have a month old baby girl i want to do a job after year leaving her in a creche i have a fear will i get a job without any experience iam eager to do a job plz help me i think your problem lies in not using effective job hunting techniques there are multiple ways to gather information and to learn about industries and available jobs you can use the internet and search company home pages and job sites network with friends family and colleagues conduct research and contact companies directly answer classified ads in newspapers professional journals and trade papers attend job fairs and open houses contact the placement office of your school work with support groups canvass community and civic associations use an employment agency look in the yellow pages and cold call check state employment and service centers call employment hot lines in specific companies career development specialists have found through experience that directly contacting targeted companies and networking are the job search methods that give the best results the overwhelming majority of jobs to percent of them are found this way they work because they lead to jobs that are often not advertised widely jobs that few people know about you also need to know why employers are rejecting you take a look at the following checklist and see if there is something you lack or might be doing wrong there are many reasons an interview doesn't result in a job offer the interviewer may think that the applicant lacked the skills to perform the job was unable to answer questions clearly and concisely didn't project and successful profile and lacked poise or confidence was overly aggressive personality wouldn't fit with team was unprepared and asked few if any meaningful questions lack of research about the company was unable to explain unfavorable factors in a resume such as employment gaps or lack of degree had unrealistic expectations about salary was more interested in salary benefits than the job almost all interviewing problems could be avoided by taking the time to prepare and practice before the interview remember it is not necessarily the candidate who is the most qualified who gets the job it's the applicant who convinces the employer that she he can do the job and become a dynamic part of the company team the formula to success is part skills and part personality so make a good impression peace and every blessing  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Advertising Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Economic inequality GED Computer virus Social rule Friends Extreme Programming Software engineering Milton H.

unlawful deduction of wage my daughter has been working at a local childrens' day nursery for mths each month always seems to be a struggle for her employers to pay the staff salary it's often late or paid in installments my daughters salary was not paid into her account on monday when it was due approaching her employer yesterday she was told that she had no money and didn't know if or when she would be able to pay her and the rest of the staff that she may have to give them all notice but as yet has not done so what concerns us more is this person owned three nurseries and one has recently become insolvent leaving a lot of angry unpaid parents and staff we are worried that my daughter may end up losing her whole months pay does anyone have any advice they could offer us that could help my daughter recover her wage fairly quickly thanks a contract of employment most people think is just a thing that employees have to follow but it is in fact applicable to both sides sumarrising what both sides agree to fulfill even if she did not sign her name on a line there is still a contract in force one of the standard terms of employment is that the employer will pay wages in a timely manner the fact that the employer has not had bills paid is not the fault of the employees so the employees cannot be held liable small claims court is possibly a latter resort but your daughter needs to tell the employer that they want money or none of the staff will work the employees are legally entitled to get paid  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Insurance Article One of the United States Constitution Wal-Mart Apprenticeship Life insurance Anarchism and capitalism National Kidney Foundation Singapore Contract Taxation in the United States Child support Civil rights Health insurance Credit card Microeconomics Employment Unlawful combatant Plame affair Appeal Surplus value Social Security (United States) Employment in Hong Kong Education in the People's Republic of China Student loan Salary cap Tax 2005 trial of Michael Jackson LiveJournal National Insurance Affirmative action Flat tax Divorce Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Compensation of employees Unemployment Day care Deflation (economics) Labour economics Minimum wage Annuity Satchel Paige Stock Conscription Economic inequality Salary Law firm Karl Rove Unemployment benefit Surplus labour Working time Payroll Capitalism SCO-Linux controversies Neighbours Tennessee State Constitution National Football League Progressive tax National Minimum Wage Act 1998 Bruce Johnson Efficiency wages Corporation Gross domestic product Wang Mang 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Operation Market Garden George W.

why do all big law firms hire associates before they receive bar exam results i keep telling myself once i get that degree more opportunities will open up when that didn't happen i went to law school and believed that more awaited me after getting a law degree that didn't open up many job propects either so i took the bar and thought well i have to pass the bar to get any law firm's attention now i've done that and got licensed i was only able to interview with one firm a solo practicioner he wouldn't talk to me until i passed the bar when i passed he said let's wait until you get sworn in when i got sworn in he offered me a year what an insult i feel that my efforts were fruitless i'm wondering how some associates at major law firms are able to start work there unlicensed well this is pretty simple first the numbers you hear about the big firms are limited to a very few graduates or sometimes they stay on the average a few years because of the number of billable hours they impose on them they take only the top students from the top schools or top students with special backgrounds accountants engineers specialists where they can bill them at high rates because they already know something they bill the associates so high they make a big profit on them there is no problem with taking bar first since they know they will pass sooner or later from their background and can bill them from the start if no client contact now for the real world most attorneys don't make much money the profession is so overcrowded the lower end cuts fees to the extent there is no profit you can only make money working where you get big billable hours because someone has clients or if you can bring in clients and have someone else do the work there was a study in illinois a few years ago that showed the median half attorneys over half under salary for attorneys was sorry if you want my advice take the job you can get and learn how to practice develop a specialty then work like crazy to develop some good clients i don't mean cheapo divorces or that kind of thing get small corporations or a niche that no one wants for instance i knew an attorney that made a fortune representing cemeteries only person i knew that did it and he cornered market i was one of the top in the country in my specialty there is room at the top and can make big money but competition is viscous and have to work like a dog and claw your way to the top i would be happy to discuss with you  Lawyer Paralegal Attorney at Law Law firm Barrister Juris Doctor Graduate school McKinsey & Company Plame affair Education in Portugal MMORPG Insurance Shaggy dog story Microeconomics Physician Law school Education in the United States Knots Landing Education in the People's Republic of China Software patent debate Corporate governance Social rule Milton H.

what do i do if a company in another state cheats me out of my wages i answered an employment ad for a company that provides workers to companies that have labor unions that are on strike scabs i live in arizona the scab company is in massachusetts the job site is in painted post n y they hired me over the phone for per hr and flew me to a hotel in ny when i got there i had to do some paperwork one of the papers was a vaguely written agreement that if the job should end for any reason prior to the end of my day committment that i would be liable for the airfare to ny as well as the bus trip ticket home they said that was to recoup transportation costs in case i quit or got fired for cause i agreed to it days into the job the supervisor at the jobsite told my boss at the scab company that he did not like my work for an unspecified reason and that i was not to return to the jobsite my scab company supervisor told me that i was terminated and i was given a bus ticket home several days later i recieved my final paycheck in the mail for they had taken all my money and used it to cover transportation costs i did not break any rules and was not even told why they let me go they just did not like me i feel that contract would not be enforceable under those conditions and i dont know who i should file a complaint to someone please help thanx in advance for your thorough answers i would contact the labor board in mass to see if this was legal these conditions should have been disclosed before they spent all that money flying you in i hope you learned your lesson that working as a scab is not smart the company knew it would probably settle the contract before the time was up and they got a bunch of labor really cheap  Trade union Wal-Mart Airline Public transport Transport Workers Union of America Microeconomics Eight hour day Octopus card International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Arbitration Graduate school Public domain Capitalism Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Minimum wage Northwest Airlines Outsourcing Termination of employment Railway Labor Act Free trade Karl Rove Surplus value Taft-Hartley Act Insurance Tom DeLay Unemployment Industrial Workers of the World Offshoring Construction Exploitation The Amazing Race Employment Vivian Solon Anarchism and capitalism Space Shuttle program Harry Bridges Elections in the United States Article One of the United States Constitution Apprenticeship Call centre Labor-power Teamsters Smallpox Immigration to the United States 1934 West Coast Longshore Strike Social Security (United States) FairTax History of the United States (1865-1918) Spam (electronic) United States labor law Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport Workers' compensation New Deal 2004-05 NHL lockout Wage slavery Rosa Parks Principal-agent problem Health insurance Jeopardy!

what are the different types of lawyers and what do they do my parents were both patent lawyers if i wanted to go into law but not tread in their footsteps completely what are some other options this is going to take some carpal tunnel types of legal practice the practice of law takes several forms the ways in which lawyers apply their expertise can be broadly categorized into the following practice types private practice involves working alone or with partners in a law firm to provide legal services to clients individuals or corporations some lawyers specialize in one or more practice areas while others engage in general practice public interest law serves low income individuals marginalized groups and social causes practitioners may work for advocacy groups legal aid clinics and other organizations with the goal of advancing an interest of the public government counsel governments hire lawyers for legal advice and representation lawyers directly employed by the government may work for ministries government agencies and crown corporations corporate counsel corporations can employ lawyers as in house counsel an in house counsel works for a single company to advise on legal matters related to its business activities practice areas specializations the law impacts our lives in numerous ways so naturally the legal profession covers many fields some lawyers practice in all areas of the law while others choose to specialize here are some areas of specialization in legal practice administrative law branch of public law dealing with the relationship between individuals and

of expression security and democratic governance corporate and commercial law deals with the formation and maintenance of businesses corporate and commercial lawyers handle contracts liability mergers

other areas in addition to the practice areas list above there are many other fields of specialization in the legal profession antitrust law entertainment law health law municipal law sports law etc
