hey sculptors is bronze sculpture an amiable profession fiscally i've looked into sculpture plenty of times and have made some pretty good amateur stuff at least i got in a publication once my concern always comes back to the extreme expense of getting something bronzed not to mention the amount of time it takes making a bronze from a to z by the time the thing gets sold are you really making anything worthy of a living half a living thanks for your opinion hi again thanks to all of you for great responses i don't find any response better than the rest i'll leave it to the voting population no you could get a job in a foundry though but a lot of foundries struggle as well and it will be a tough job if you have a daytime job don't quit until you sold enough pieces to give you an impression you can make a living of it it really depends how many comissions you get and not many get enough to make a living if you get a comission you would add the price for getting it cast in bronze into the total price if you work as a freelance sculptor you don't really get to do what you like you have to do what other people like  Henry Moore Auguste Rodin Social rule Steel Norway national football team 2000 Australian Grand Prix Theory of conduct Time Out of Mind Illegal drug trade Jacob Epstein Sampling (music) Microeconomics Aladdin (1992 film) Inflation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hey Jude Plastic Labor theory of value RuneScape quests Art forgery Digital photography RuneScape weapons Plaster The Apprentice 2 Wood carving Bronze sculpture Miniature figure Empire Burlesque EastEnders Glossary of sculpting terms Buffalo Bills Supply and demand The Kiss (Rodin sculpture) Sand casting Gross domestic product Capital accumulation 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand Atomism Jacques Saly Mid-levels Iron Michelangelo Tax Art in Ancient Greece Plame affair Social Security (United States) Mattress National Kidney Foundation Singapore Jack Charlton It's Walky!

how do you make concrete furniture how would i make a concrete couch for my back yard or any kind of mold for that matter what do artist use to make things like that then put tile on them as mosaics i guess you would just built the form out of stuff i am hoping to figure this out thanks for the help hi you could probably use hypertufa there are numerous recipes for it and it can be made to simulate old mossy stone the main component of it is portland cement and then an organic component like sifted peat moss or sawdust a strengthening component like loose fiberglass or plastic and perlite vermiculite or sand items made with this can withstand temperatures down to f and you can shape it pretty easily and carve into it for a few hours while it's curing you can do a search for this term on yahoo and find a lot of links with recipes for making it if you do want to make a real concrete item with mosaic elements you might check out the wetcanvas sculpture channel there are many threads and articles with photos and steps that would help you with this process there are also items here that have been made with hypertufa in a nutshell a form is made with some material and chicken wire is formed over that and a concrete mixture is added over the top and mosiac elements are added in either during the process or afterward and grouted in hope this helps and i hope your project goes well wetcanvas is a wonderful artist community website and basic membership is completely free there are currently more than worldwide members and many artistic channels for just about any type of artwork you can think of  Plastic Concrete Houseplant Pottery Plaster Portland cement Seismic retrofit Explosive material Boat building Building material Pavement (material) Drill bit Textile manufacturing Fiberglass Steel Legal research Vermicompost Masonry Stucco Opportunity rover Polymer clay Hydroponics Knife Sampling (music) Algorithm Geodesic dome Panama Canal Locks Reinforced concrete Printed circuit board Ceramics Bread The Apprentice 2 Guitar Information Services Procurement Library Carbon fiber Hamster Silicon Asbestos Brewery Natural building Transistor Roof Sewage treatment Architecture of the California missions Aggregate (composite) Metallurgy Recipe Polystyrene Glossary of sculpting terms Radio controlled airplane Rococo Japanese tea ceremony Sculpture The Star Wars Holiday Special Dam Loudspeaker BBC Dice Mortar (masonry) Futari wa Pretty Cure Iron Basement Sand casting Visual Basic XML Strap-on dildo Die (manufacturing) Cerebellum Woodworking PHP Fuselage Photography Product Lifecycle Management Culture of Korea Java programming language Spark plug Open Directory Project Repouss__ and chasing Cuisine of Denmark Rigging Ice cream Homebuilt aircraft Poker jargon Microeconomics Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Knitting Mid-levels Injection moulding Titanium Fancy rat Tokusatsu Gas metal arc welding Lightning

is this a sculpture or an installation i had sculpted a life size human figure with wire and placed it sitting on a chair and table the figure in a sleeping position with its head lying on a book on the table and i had connected some nails from the head to the book with wire the figure chair and table are not connected by any glue or stuff and the book is a real one cuz i'm using mixed media and if wanna exhibit it'll require some time to place the objects like a person sitting down with the head and hands on the table sleeping so the whole piece consists of a wire human table chair and a real book can anyone tell me if mine's a mixed media sculpture or mixed media installation your piece is a mixed media sculpture why because although it is made up of a variety of materials the sculpted figure the ready mades the wire the book table nails they form together a single unit a dimensional object or form if the elements which make up your sculpture had been spread out in space perhaps distributed on the floor the walls or even the ceiling so that their total effect would have been to change the way that we the viewers experience a particular space then one would have been looking at a mixed media installation  Sculpture Drawing Manifold Mattress Casting Glossary of sculpting terms Henry Moore Stairway Chair Lighting Drill bit Maxwell's equations Textile manufacturing Human position Seismic retrofit Wood carving Harp Fire fighting Fan (implement) Nail (anatomy) Basement Professional wrestling match types Stucco Rococo Mixed martial arts Hash table Upholstery Tesla coil Color Grace Cossington Smith Cyberspace Solar cell Antenna (radio) Explosive material Cello Traditional animation Volleyball Transformer Naval mine Screw Mosaic Violin Out-of-body experience Wire Annuity Lorentz group Wallpaper group Solar system Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ethernet Radio controlled airplane Sand art and play Art in Ancient Greece Table tennis Yoko Ono Lathe HTML element Perl Barbed wire Sundial Doctor (Doctor Who) Spark plug Dog agility Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Compact disc Japanese tea ceremony Art Alexander Calder The Three Graces Timber framing Windows XP Graphics St. Peter's Basilica Air-raid shelter Floppy disk Electrophysiology Polarization Hamster Double bass Eastern Orthodox Church Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Lie group Yoga Sutras of Patanjali CIE 1931 color space Welding Ice hotel Baroque Carpet Langmuir probe Diamond cut M__bius strip Rachel Whiteread President (game) Temporal bone Bookbinding Digital circuit
