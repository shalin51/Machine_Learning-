job interview round i got called back for a second interview for marketing coordinator at this point i'd like to be sure i am interviewing them as well to ensure that this job is really a fit for me they mentioned at the first interview that they previously had other people in this position within the last year and that turnover is common as with any large corporation is it okay to ask why these former employees left what they disliked about the position or do you think that is something i should stay away from i think knowing how others felt about the position gives me insight as to how i will feel about it and if i am confident enough to do the job well i also agree that the questions you mentioned are inappropriate for an interview ideally you want the interviewer to feel that you want this position over all others in the marketplace make them feel comfortable that you are certain this is the right job for you they don't want to be re conducting this same job search in a month's time however i do know of people who have asked why the person before them left but they did so in a way that sounded less intrusive something like is this a position with opportunity for advancement i was curious if the person who previously held this position moved up in the company since turnover is common you may casually ask them why this is the case just be careful not to push anyone's limits  Social rule Plame affair The Apprentice 2 Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Milton H.

scared of sales i need to know how i can overcome my actual fear of performing sales i have been employed as a manager in a corporate environment for several years however i have worked for someone else i have no marketing skills i have some college course work completed at the same time there are several example of successful entrepreneurs that do not have college education i really want to know from serious individuals how i overcome this barrier in addition i have never had the ambition to become an entrepreneur another situation i am afraid of however it appears that if i want to enjoy the rest of my life without fear of being broke this is the way i have come to the realization that all successful entrepreneurs have had to conduct sales to some degree real advice only thank you i have been in sales now for six months and it can be scary at first the best way to get over this fear is just to do it for example when you are telemarketing you probably look at the phone and think i just don't want to call well when you break it down logically what are you scared of fear of the unknown fear of rejection being hung up on not knowing what to say all of this dosen't really matter you have to know that they are not rejecting you personally they just do not want what you are currently selling and after being in sales you will see that you will find alot of these people compared to people actually wanting your product and it might even shock you at first when they want to meet now if you are planning to cold call by going door to door realize that they probably do not want to see you most businesses have the no soliciting sign on the door walk past that bad boy and if they call you out on it say you didn't see it your goal on a cold call is to set an appointment for the future it would be pretty rare if your contact would actually want to meet face to face on a cold call this just shows respect for the client couple more things believe in what you sell if you don't how will a prospect last thing if you are scared of calls just pick up the phone and dial who cares if they get pissed move on to the next person and you will eventually find that person if none of this works sales might not be your thing good luck and always remember smile and dial  Telemarketing Shaggy dog story Jon Secada Humphrey Bogart Plame affair Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.

what are good sites to search for startup jobs when you say startup jobs i don't know if you mean a job from home or if you are really looking for a job with a start up company if it's the latter i would look at sites like craigslist or even in the job section of your local paper many new companies don't yet have the big budgets to go on huge employee searches so they rely on the cheapest methods possible this would be the paper and free places like craigslist if you're looking for an at home job i'd be cautious as many of these companies are scams keep in mind that legitimate employers never ask you to send them money to get a job with them never so when they say small investment or need for any reason stay away from them good luck in your search  Craigslist Confidence trick Software patent debate Dot-com Outsourcing Internet fraud Spam (electronic) Computer virus Insurance Labour economics Bank fraud Search engine Free trade MapleStory Craps Hurricane Katrina disaster relief Freeters Web traffic 401(k) Great Depression Charles Ponzi Mail-order bride Inflation Kazaa Offshoring Sweatshop Mail fraud MMORPG Economy of India Privatization Matrix scheme Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Customs and etiquette of Japan Lottery Search engine optimization Venture capital Don Rosa Capitalism E-mail spam Paragliding Reaganomics Sing Tao Daily Legal research Annuity Newcastle United F.C.

loan officer or insurance sales which is harder right now i am working as a loan officer but i have the opportunity to cross over into insurance mortgages are pretty easy because if you call enough people eventually you find some that want or that you can convince they need to refinance but i feel some of the things that are acceptable to do are immoral and i don't want to compromise my intergrity which is harder to sell which demands more hours and which has more income potential are there immoral aspects of the insurance business i just don't like selling people at a higher interest rate than they qualify for so i can get money back from a bank while they pay more but my company pressures me to i'd go in to a different job altogether what kind of degree do you have i only say this because i've worked in an insurance office before and there's calling lots of calling do you want to switch your life over to us from xx you can save it's not a savings of they're spending just as much it's just at your office instead of someone else's if you'll still be at the bank and you're supposed to get mortgage insurance or home insurance they're more than likely getting it with their mortgage payment or through an outside office if you have a mathematics degree you could be an actuary they make figures they don't call anybody they do figures calculations on computers it's not bad work good luck to you  Mortgage Insurance Life insurance Primerica Financial Services Annuity Money Bond Bank Savings and loan association Debt Unemployment benefit Taxation in the United States Personal finance Unemployment Federal National Mortgage Association Deflation (economics) Tax Predatory lending Mutual fund Interest Economy of Russia Financial markets Great Depression Health insurance Finance 401(k) Derivative (finance) Capital accumulation Supply-side economics Government National Mortgage Association Financial services New Deal Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Security (finance) Monopoly (game) Real estate bubble Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Actuarial notation Gross domestic product Usury Inflation Mortgage-backed security Toronto-Dominion Bank Charles Ponzi Call centre Interest rate Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Collateralized mortgage obligation Student loan Annual percentage rate Subsidy Blackjack Economy of the United States Savings and Loan crisis Irish Life and Permanent Gold standard Commodity markets Theory of conduct Consumer finance Credit card Leeds United F.C.

jobs for what are some good paying jobs for a year old here's a short list of jobs which you can create to generate income learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties birthday celebrations etc seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples a starter calligraphy kit usually runs around and anyone can easily pick up this skill the going rate is usually per hand addressed item become a poser who assists wedding photographers in setting and arranging various individuals in group and single photographic positions posers carry around a sketch book of various sitting and standing poses which consists of onion skin overlays of various wedding pictures bound in albums again contact local wedding photographers and wedding planners accordingly the hourly pay is around per hour and you are often invited to attend all dining activities seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting weed removal plant tree trimming light brush clearance you will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools again do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved a door to door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between to per hour offer policing removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process again a door to door solicitation of neighbors is in order you can charge between to per hour acquire a set of window cleaning tools a bucket liquid window cleaner sponge squeegee handle with an extension and a small step ladder and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services however be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story charge per window panel become a proxy stand in for neighbors to allow delivery of goods and packages to your home apartment acquire the authority to sign any receipt of incoming packages as an accepting neighbor charge per each package handled by you consider becoming a restaurant cafe customer liaison by using your cell phone at restaurants cafes to coordinate with the hostess to keep track of waiting customers whenever there's a very long period of time to activate a waiting list you want to offer the restaurant your services so that customers do not have to stand around for any lengthy period of time and when their name assigned number comes up you can call the upcoming customer's cell phone to tell them that they can return to the restaurant and be served the call back fee is usually around cents on a per head basis for example a couple would be charged while children under would not be charged placement of a plaque which outlines your fee schedule near the hostess station is sufficient to garner attention of prospective customers who will value your services since they can do other activities outside of the restaurant often beyond the range of any inhouse paging system you realize that everyone has a cellphone and why not take advantage of the connectivity to make the diner's experience worthwhile the restaurant will also appreciate the added service you are providing as a customer liaison why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing convalescent assisted living care centers and hospitals it involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves the starting rate is per hour the only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding a posting of your services by a business card or flyer on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers the paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time good luck  Spam (electronic) United States

i am a high school student and i am interested in becoming an independent sales rep where do i go from here i am only in high school but i already know that i would like to do some thing that involves sales i like the fact that an independent sales rep can pretty much pick his own hours and time that he works this job seems like a good option for me but i do not know much about it what can i do in high school to prepare for a job in sales and for anyone who is already a sales rep any info on the job itself would be perfect thanks first this is a good thing that already a this young age you are open minded some people will past their entire life without knowing what is it they want to do been an independant rep can be hard at time if you work in a company that pays only commision on your personnal effort because eveyone try to destroy the other ones in order to get the best commission possible there is other way and these are a lot more profitable working along with people that want the best possible result for you is not common in traditionnal business this is why i hated the corporate world until i discovered the company i'm presently affiliate with the latest technologies are ours to market and we all help each other because that way everyone have success the key is we only take people whom are serious about having a great life and are willing to learn and stay on the side of integrity anyhow if you want to start learning you can communicate with me via my portal http brigittevallee acnrep com  Internet fraud Unemployment Electronic commerce Microeconomics Extreme Programming United Kingdom corporation tax Supply and demand Investment bank W.

how do you find a job in marketing not personal selling i'm a marketing student and i want to go into my field but there is a lot of prymid companies claiming to be marketing firms you are smart to recognize that it took me years to get our career placement center to post jobs for our students that would not be pyramid schemes right now i'm a marketing professor who works closely with our students on placement with a lot of success here are a couple of suggestions if you haven't yet graduated there are a couple of things you can should do one is to do at least one and possibly more internships many entry level jobs these days require from one to three years of related work experience and the only way to get this is through internships another possibility would be informational interviews if your school's career center will work with you on this they can set up an appointment for you with an alumnus working in the field you ask them a lot of questions about what what they do without expectation of anyone hiring you but you gain information which will help you on the job market and also make it clearer to you what you want to do the last question can be can you recommend someone else in the field that i should talk to i know of someone who did this and people were so impressed with her interest that she ended up getting job offers in a really bad job market now as you get ready to graduate or if you have graduated since you are not interested in personal selling the types of jobs you might want to look at would be those called marketing coordinator marketing assistant and marketing analyst marketing assistant is a little confusing because while some of these jobs have you do actual marketing some are actually secretarial jobs for the marketing department so you need to read the job ad carefully to make sure it is what you want some marketing coordinator and marketing analyst jobs are entry level while others can require as much as ten or more years of experience so again you need to read further but it is a good starting place if you are interested in advertising appropriate directions for a marketing student would be assistant account manager or assistant traffic manager pr firms also hire marketing students fairly regularly so where to look do check your college's career center they do this for a living and should have some possibilities for you also ask your professors if they have any connections sometimes alumni will contact us wanting to hire a new graduate network as much as you can join clubs and go to events recommended by your professors if you can possibly afford it also while some people will tell you that only personal contacts matter a lot of my students have gotten jobs through job ads since i don't know where you are located i can't tell you which sources are good in your area but i go through every couple of days and pull job and internship listings from sites like monstertrak com entertainmentcareers net showbizjobs com teamworkonline com indeed com careerbuilder com hotjobs com monster com along with the search engine on my linkedin network i've been finding tons of jobs in really good companies in this area lately i'm not sure what it would be like in other parts of the country make sure your resume is in good shape and know how to put together a meaningful cover letter so that you are ready and make sure you have your resume readily available in case an opportunity arises good luck  Plame affair Professor Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Corporate governance Karl Rove Intern Software engineering Education in Germany Management Paralegal Web traffic Management information system Theory of conduct Killian documents Microeconomics Lawyer Walt Disney World College Program Internet fraud Wal-Mart Academia Social network Scientology beliefs and practices Annuity Kasparov versus The World Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Search engine optimization Outsourcing Social rule Unemployment Avenue Q Jeff Gannon Spyware Password Michael D.

work issues how to cope please read on recently ive been having some issues at work and i'm not sure how to handle them as in best course of action theres so much to say but i'll keep it to the basics of whats most important i suppose i'm fairly new so i havent much say in the matter but basically theres no proper training procedures being followed for myself and another member of the staff as dictated by policy a prerequisite for the job not just because we want to know some of my guys staff have been written up for things they by all means shouldnt have as its total crap one of my guys had his f t status pushed to p t without his consent and i dont think thats allowed i'm being held responisble for 'mistakes' on things that i was never trained properly to do that are part of my job and for which i shouldve been trained before being given the position i'm expected to do my job without being instructed on this particular companys procedre or being rushed through it wait for details i've worked in this 'field' a long time but as you well know every company's poilicies and procedures are different i havent been trained properly in their procedures yet my boss will say 'oh i told you twice' when in fact he didnt somethings he told me once in a quick run through but i wasnt trained i feel as though its making me out to be a fool and i dont care for that i'm completely competent to do my job and i keep asking for the required training courses i should have had when i started and hes saying theres no time for me to do it wait for details also i'm learning what i can from they staff thats been there but for most of them i'm either on the same level or i'm over them in position how am i supposed to resolve customer issues and help my staff if i havent been trained in how to by company procedure handle the inquirys issues i'm growing increasingly irritated with the whole situation and i am not sure what to do every time i ask to finish my training my boss tells me there isnt the time yet every other person that has the same position as me has gone through their required courses and most have been there a while so they know the job well enough wait for details sorry i don't appreciate made to look like a fool and one of my guys suggested by observation that perhaps my boss has a bit of an attitude towards women i dont know this to be fact there are other women on our staff though not many and i dont know thier input feelings on it i'm trying to take into consideration that my boss hasnt ever worked in this industry before so maybe thats why he's the way he is but i think im just making excuses also i vehemently disagree with my guys being written up for no reason they are excellent employess and always do their best for me yet i've no control over what my boss does theres more but im not getting into it i'm in conflict over this i dont know what should i do how should i handle this any suggestions adonis thank you the reason why you have been hired is bec as youve said you are in the 'field or industry' for quite some time so you wre hired bec of your competency level at some point new hires are expected to fend for themselves and have the initiative to learn the system or the ropes of the new company here your ability to adapt is really tested including your flexiblity initiative and ability to perfom tasks under pressure unfortunately dear from what ive read so far you have been focusing on your demands and complains although i agree that your boss should have trained you well you still need to have initiative in learning based on my experience it is sometimes annoying for new hires to expect attention when the old ones have work to do i think it will really work well for you to train yourself on basic compnay procedures etc bec in this day and age people will really hire a person with teammanship and flexibility maybe the best way is to put yourself in your colleague's and boss' shoes and try to see how they would perceive you if they learn of how you actually feel  Scientology beliefs and practices Theory of conduct Second language acquisition Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act
