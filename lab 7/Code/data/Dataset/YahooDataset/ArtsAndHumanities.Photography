dont you find it annoying that people that people take black and white pictures with regular digital cameras and say its art and its photography and when they have no experience in photography that really annoys me it is annoying every fine artist i know has spent years perfecting the way they use their medium to produce their art then people pick up a camera use no technique and call their mistakes art yes it is annoying and perhaps dishonest on their part it is also annoying that others support this lie  Photography Digital camera Photograph Fine art photography Digital photography Digital art Cinematography Stereoscopy Art Black-and-white Photographic film Panavision Medium format Zone system Color Panoramic photography Paparazzi Surveillance Film Photojournalism Gamut Traditional animation Closed-circuit television Henri Cartier-Bresson Graphic design Digital camera back Impressionism Fine art Leica Charge-coupled device High-definition television Camera Digital cinema Transparency (photography) Drawing Macro photography Secret photography Social rule 35 mm film View camera Shutter speed Instant camera Holography Technicolor Anamorphic widescreen Alfred Stieglitz Video Television Contax Visual arts Magic (illusion) African American art George Lucas Cardcaptor Sakura Cinematographer Robert Frank Public Broadcasting Service Pinhole camera Motion picture terminology Bullet time Yearbook Academy Honorary Award Collage Graphics Savannah College of Art and Design History of film Canon EOS Movie camera 3D computer graphics Grayscale Pornography BBC One Moir__ pattern Modern art William Eggleston Secure Digital card Automatic number plate recognition Image Slit-scan photography Digital image editing Aesthetic Realism Single-lens reflex camera Documentary photography Digital cinematography Jennifer Lopez Dave McKean MTV2 Canon T90 Film crew Bondage (BDSM) Raw image format Graffiti Group f/64 Lewis Carroll Time-lapse Film editing Slayers Bluetooth Stop motion Street photography

how do i download pictures off of my digital camera onto my computer what do i need to download pictures onto my computer this is for br anne the only book i have for my computer only tells how to hook up the computer itself nothing on how to download pictures from a camera not even with my printer either hopefully you have the cable that comes with your digital camera plug that into the digital camera then plug the other end which is called a usb plug into a usb port on your pc make sure the camera is turned off before doing this windows xp will detect the camera when you turn it on after it is plugged in and will then automatically give you the option on what you want to do with those photos as far as copying them all or just a select few  Universal Serial Bus IPod Digital photography Secure Digital card Digital camera FireWire Bluetooth Windows XP Xbox Closed-circuit television Musical Instrument Digital Interface D-subminiature PlayStation Portable Floppy disk Xbox 360 Mouse (computing) High-definition television USB mass storage device class Copy protection XD-Picture Card Multifunction printer Photography Sound card Memory Stick ITunes Windows Vista Nintendo Revolution DVD Common Unix Printing System Pixel Modem Atari ST Digital audio player Game Boy Television Telephone exchange IMac Computer forensics Personal computer ACCESS.bus Parallel port Apple Computer Commodore 64 AlphaSmart Atari 8-bit family Memory card Dongle Digital rights management Hard disk Apple Macintosh Embedded system Dot matrix printer Sony Rootkit Computer Computer hardware Computer printer Microsoft Windows Danger Hiptop Digital Visual Interface RS-232 Image PlayStation 2 IPhoto History of Microsoft Windows Konica Minolta N-Gage Archos MicroATX Online music store Warez SCART Serial ATA Nintendo DS Barcode reader Screenshot IPod shuffle Cheating in Counter-Strike Sharp Zaurus IPod photo Mandriva Linux Digital cinematography Serial port Adapter CompactFlash Road-rule enforcement camera Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Enigma machine Read-only memory Iriver Stereoscopy Wi-Fi Yearbook Nintendo 64 AmigaOS Film Power Mac G4 Cube

how does he do it omg i know technology doesn't make a better artist but what camera what software package is this guy using is it a combination of programs how flikr user just http www flickr com photos n first the guy knows what he is doing in terms of composition lighting and exposure my guess for several of the photos since it is the easiest approach and the one that i would have used is that it is what is called a 'duo tone' done in photoshop easy is a very relative term here the process starts with converting the image to gray scale most likely using channels from the appearance then you select the colors for the duo tone photoshop has instructions and a process for creating duotones in many of the others it seems he is also working with the color channels independently for anyone interested you can look up online the various ways working independently with channels can be used creatively vance  Adobe Photoshop Drawing RGB color model Photography Apple Macintosh PNG Traditional animation Digital image editing Ajax (programming) Common Unix Printing System Stereoscopy Commodore 64 Screenshot Unified Modeling Language Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis B3ta 2D computer graphics Mouse (computing) Software engineering Cinematography Blog SonicStage Butterfly Raw image format Digital photography World Wide Web Bryce Flickr Spyware Photographic film Copyleft Uniform Resource Locator Digital art Camera Compiler optimization Color Game programmer ASCII art Computer virus Anaglyph image Nintendo Entertainment System Computer software Goatse.cx PlayStation Portable IPod Computer-supported collaboration Computer Linux DragonFly BSD System/36 Geographic information system Rendering (computer graphics) Musical Instrument Digital Interface Database ImageMagick HyperCard Machine vision Finale notation program Graphic design XML Windows Vista Programming language AmigaOS Explosive material Atari 8-bit family CPU design Synthesizer Visual Basic Thread (computer science) PostScript Extreme Programming Graphics Speech synthesis Nintendo DS Wiki Adobe Illustrator Konica Minolta Charge-coupled device Apple II family CPU cache Xbox 360 Adobe Systems Computer program Apple Computer Software agent DVD 3D computer graphics Object-oriented programming Motion capture Free software Mac OS X TeX MOS Technology 6502 Art Read-only memory Internet phenomenon Deep Impact (space mission) PC Engine

a standard answer to the stupid b w and one colour question this question is about one in ten really its not even a photography question please join with me and use the standard answer below if a few of us do it it might get these time watsers to go ask in graphic arts or a computer section the answer is go ask in grafic arts im being precious i know but like other pros i know photoshop wont do anything for peoples photographic skills in fact it just keeps them swimming in the sea of retarded automatic image making how many times do we get a link to a professional image with lighting and good exposure and the question how do i do this the answer is study lighting and photography but the photoshopers give a long winded method to try and get the result which is impossible tell me how does that help people comments thanks will you join me in the answer go ask in graphic arts or is it the right thing to do so it wont happen a helene thanks for honouring us with your answer me i think the images look stupid and ametuer why do they do it no idea thats right they have no other ideas a thanks cabbie you on to it thanks evan i see your points but sort of disagree to me photohop is down time alot of my work i dont know what the final product will be and dont care as long as they pay i had one client insist i do the graphic work told him no he insisted so i charged him my normal rate and got a student to do the work at a nice profit i charge an hour for my skill experience and results why would i want an hour to do stuff that bores me to tears all our bizzos are different of course for me photoshop is a theif of time my work on trannie dont need any work because i spent hours setting up my light i earn well because im skilled lights etc thats where i charge the big photoshop is the theif of time and income for me id rather spend hours in the field than days in photoshop pays the same half a day making art or days in photoshop easy choise they are different skills to me i might retouch a little no more needed i hire a student it works me that selective desaturation look was the coolest thing ever the first hundred or so times it was used i would say that effects of that type can absolutely be the purview of a photographer or a graphic artist though the line between is becoming increasingly blurry of course photographers can remain pure shot makers leaving the digital dirty work to graphic artists and they will be less and less competitive against the photographers that are skilled in lighting composition exposure and digital wizardry sure some top photographers may not need those skills to survive but they will be farther and farther between as clients of all kinds expect design elements in their products why would i want to entrust my artistic efforts to a graphic artist that may not share my vision anyway  Photography Adobe Photoshop Stereoscopy Digital photography Graphic design View camera Software engineering Drawing Macro photography Graphics Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Game programmer Computer graphics Scientology beliefs and practices Color Cinematography Depth of field Konica Minolta Jennifer Lopez Theory of conduct Microeconomics The Apprentice 2 Traditional animation Art Labor theory of value Education in the People's Republic of China Holography Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Martial art Socrates Ethics Call centre IBM PC compatible Film Digital camera Economic inequality Wheel of Fortune B3ta Copyleft Cheating in Counter-Strike Requirements analysis Color blindness Parachuting Photographic film Progressive tax Speed of light Database Quizbowl Labour economics CPU cache Modem Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Windows Vista Science Explosive material Digital circuit Economics Floppy disk Panoramic photography Scientific method Crop circle Transformation problem Good Times Mojave people Rendering (computer graphics) Plame affair Social rule Billboard Hot 100 Solar cell PNG Screenshot Pinball Windows 2000 3D computer graphics Extreme Programming Computer Luminiferous aether PlayStation Portable Graduate school Prices of production Time Out of Mind RISC Little Britain Geographic information system Welding Autostereogram Enterprise content management Education Seventh Sea (collectible card game)

glass photo what a difference a day makes i shot a quick example of how someone could take a suitable photo for ebay last night i didn't want to move stuff around and so i got a fair result i decided that i couldn't let it stand and say just take my word for it so i moved some stuff out of my way to gain the lighting angle that i prefer and recommended to our asker lit from behind http www flickr com photos samfeinstein lit from the front http www flickr com photos samfeinstein in fact once you are on the first photo just click on the other cream pitcher in my photostream and you can swap quickly as i said under the photo it's not quite catalog material yet but it's an improvement it's just a point and shoot camera too like anyone might already own the only special equipment needed is a tripod since you would be using the self timer and a light weight point and shoot camera you don't even need to spend and up on a tripod just a tripod would be fine antoni you should see my rolled horizon it's just a jacket turned inside out so the lining shows and it's hanging on top of a box thanks though ebay photography has taught me a lot of quick and dirty tricks thanks teef here i'm thinking that anyone could set up and take this shot and you say something nice terisu check me out http www flickr com photos samfeinstein if you ever need to shot a ring again goes to show the old adage it's not the camera so much as the photographer that is a really really nice effect i suspect that a magazine on a budget would be quire prepared to use that shot personally i prefer the realism of some sort of shadowing rather than a complete white box approach i also suspect that some of the nice highlights in your shot could not have been achieved with a white box solution well done thanks for sharing  Photography View camera War of the Worlds (2005 film) Butterfly Volleyball Stereoscopy Macro photography Mouse (computing) Parallax Street photography Wrigley Field Photographic film Futurama (TV series - season 5) Skateboarding trick Henri Cartier-Bresson Black hole Konica Minolta Diablo II: Lord of Destruction M16 (rifle) Roxette Drawing London Fast bowling Dragon Booster Canon T90 Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February GunBound Cliff Richard Second Battle of the Atlantic The Contender (television series) Screw Surveillance B-47 Stratojet Amateur astronomy Cascading Style Sheets Kasparov versus The World STS-61 Coffee Sundial Warez Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Live 8 Snooker Mojave people Flickr Leica Characters in the Smurfs Shen Gong Wu Care Bears Machine gun StarCraft: Uprising IMAX Camera Combat Mission (computer game series) Shadow the Hedgehog (video game) Blood on the Tracks The Inside GunZ The Duel The Apprentice 2 Beatles for Sale Topps Armored Core Professional wrestling throws Tripod (photography) Ty Cobb November (film) Softball Film Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Mozilla Firefox Depth of field Whose Line Is It Anyway?

what would be the best camera to buy for someone who want to make photography their hobby cost is no problem also im going to invest a lot of time in this new hobby thank you you didn't specify whether you wanted to work in digital photography or film so i'll give you my preferences for both personally as a hobby i find film to be much much more enjoyable especially if you do your own developing and printing if this is what you're going for i would suggest buying a nikon or canon with a metal frame go to a good camera shop and see what they've got the older the better as technology advances so do technological problems never once have i had a problem with my older cameras plus they're easy to use and virtually indestructable my first camera was a nikon nikkormat i've bought new cameras for more money and the nikkormat is still my absolute favorite it'a reliable easy and extremely hard wearing i've dropped it on cement accidentally without even a scratch as for digital i admit that it's not my area of knowledge however my digital photo buddies are nuts for nikon's digital cameras particularly the d their pictures come out pretty amazing i must say since you have the money to spare i would reccomend buying a camera in person and not trying to save money by buying one off ebay or anything cameras are delicate one scratch on a lens can ruin all your pictures go in person and see what you're getting also small local camera shops often know more about their cameras than anywhere else and they're willing to work with you and give you reccomendations the extra cost is well worth it good luck  Digital single-lens reflex cameras Nikon Corporation Konica Minolta View camera Camera Photography Stereoscopy Technicolor Advanced Photo System Anamorphic widescreen Nikon FE Gramophone record Leica Movie projector Digital cinema Nikon FM2 Single-lens reflex camera Nikon FE2 Nikon FA Photographic lens Macro photography Canon EOS Digital camera back Canon T90 Traditional animation Rangefinder camera Amateur astronomy Panavision Mouse (computing) Nikon D70 Cinematography Pornography Computer Surveillance Panoramic photography Eastman Kodak Binoculars Camcorder Copy protection Philatelic investment Photograph Photographic film IBM PC compatible Film Digital video 35 mm film Time Out of Mind Laserdisc Hyperinflation Photojournalism Money Bullet time Electronic commerce Point and shoot camera Closed-circuit television Energy development Charge-coupled device Shutter speed Disposable camera Bulk vending Pentax Advance fee fraud Cinerama Canon Inc.

what is the best digital camera for taking pics in low light i e at a club taking pics of a band on stage i've bought a couple of digital cameras in the past ranging from but there's always either a problem with the auto focus delay or the low light delay pics coming out blurry etc any advice as to what i should look for in a camera where my main focus no pun intended will be taking pictures of bands playing in clubs where the lighting is mixed if you can get a digital slr with a fast lens your problems are solved if you can't spend upwards of though look into the fujifilm f series the current model that looks best to me is the f fd it has a reputation for good low light performance switch to a center weighted or better spot meter reading for the best exposure of the performers you'll have to forget about white balance and it probably won't matter anyway just leave it on auto wb and hope for the best low light performance you could tell us what type of camera p s dslr you are considering and we can recommend some models over others for low light performance you can't simply look at the iso available on a camera because you have no way of knowing simply by seeing a number like iso or iso if the camera is any good at that speed you only know that the camera functions in low light conditions but not how well it functions the same goes for image stabilization etc image stablization vibration reduction shake reduction lets you use longer exposures to let in more light while offsetting the tendancy for camera shake to blur the picture during longer exposures but this might be offset by digital noise or excessive noise reduction in the image processor that goes along with the extended shutter speeds there are two things to look for though as a general rule although not always you can expect better low light performance from a larger sensor in p s cameras this means that you should look for a sensor that is approx or a which is twice as big as the more commonly used sensor slr sensors are huge by comparison though the second thing to look for is a wide aperture on the lens aperture numbers work backwards so an f lens is wider than an f smaller numbers are generally better for low light the only real way to tell is to read reviews on the cameras that you are interested in you didn't mention your price range but most digital slr's are much better than most point and shoot cameras among the point and shoot cameras the fuji f series has probably got the best reputation for low light performance these would be specifically the f f f fd and f fd morey will have more to say about this if he sees this question the f fd is at b h photo for and they have the f fd for i don't see the f or f listed any longer but perhaps you can find them in stores they would be under if you can find one fujifilm f fd review http www dpreview com reviews fujifilmf fd fujifilm f fd preview http www dpreview com news fujifilmfinepixf fd asp  Konica Minolta Canon T90 View camera Stereoscopy Aperture Macro photography Nikon Corporation Camera Photographic film Depth of field Panoramic photography Canon EOS Computer Contax Exposure (photography) Film speed Canon EF lens mount Mouse (computing) Movie projector Photographic lens Shutter speed Point and shoot camera Camcorder Eye Oscilloscope Medium format CPU design Sensor Digital camera back Wind turbine F-number Bluetooth Canon PowerShot G IMAX Lighting Canon EOS-20D Automatic number plate recognition Charge-coupled device Canon EOS-300D Amateur astronomy Astronomical seeing Rangefinder camera Secure Digital card MP3 Motion capture Galileo spacecraft CPU cache Eyepiece Jet engine B-47 Stratojet Federal Standard 1037C Transformer E85 Antenna (radio) Panavision Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft Advanced Photo System Weight training Enlarger Telescope Full frame digital SLR Armored Core ISO 9000 Binoculars Explosive material Radar Computer vision Hard disk Rendering (computer graphics) Electrophysiology DVD Digital Musical Instrument Digital Interface Optical coherence tomography Film Gamut STS-62 C programming language Strategic management

any photgraphy hints i just started in a journalist class and i am the photographer for the school newspaper and i dont really feel like my teacher is expecting to much and doesnt really think that i can come up with some really good shots so i wanted to impress him and prove him wronge i love photography and want to persue it outside of school to so i was looking for some hints and tips so getting a really great shot hi ash if photography really gets ahold of you you'll probably find it won't let go for the rest of your life if you are using the schools camera make arrangements to use it outside of whatever they consider the normal times if you have your own cool you're good to go i'm going to assume digital here get a good basic book on photography to get the basics down exposure metering how to read the histogram and using the camera's controls shutter iso aperture the public library can be a good resource and the 'for dummies' series would be good here a very good book is essential skills 'location photography' by mark galer published by focal press you might have to order that one from amazon a school photographer generally shoots school events including sports and candids on or near campus for sports you'll want to use the 'motor' drive on the camera and shoot through the action by that i mean you'll press the shutter just before the peak action and release it just after you'll also be doing what is known as panning which is where you follow the subject with the camera while shooting the books should explain how this is done why this is done and how you can use it creatively it's a learned skill and will need to be practiced for candids well there are lots of ways to do those you will be looking for images that actually say something besides this person was here doing that or talking to that person here is where the internet can really help you look up the works of various photojournalists online and see what went into the impact of their images a suggested list is w eugene smith he heavily influenced my style margaret bourke white robert cappa henri cartier bresson and there are many others good resources are the associated press photo archives and the time magazine archives you can use google images and search for images coming from those and many other news organizations what's important is not the images themselves but how the photographer captured it so that it makes a statement you won't be able to copy their images but you can start putting together the elements they used to create impact into your own shooting lighting composition and the moment start taking pictures and give yourself assignments it doesn't matter what the assignments are they could be anything but they need a theme and it should be something that people can react to this will help you become sensitive to the 'moment' and recognize it take lots of pictures and i mean lots a to per assignment you give yourself is very reasonable you want to do two things with your pictures for the ones that work you want to study them to find out why they work the ones that don't work are even more valuable those are the ones you will really learn from you won't remember this none of us do but you learned to walk by falling on your butt and then figuring out what to try next and going for it it's exactly the same here keep a notebook of all your shots date time camera settings and what the goals of the shots were photojournalism involves a lot of luck what makes for good to great pictures is when luck presents you with an opportunity and you have prepared yourself to take advantage of it also there is something else you need to be aware of and that is the shooting ratio that is the number of images you take to the number of images that are really worth considering for an experienced photog that ratio maybe ten 'bad' images to each good one this is for shooting under all and very differing conditions a sports photographer who really knows the sport they are covering probably get get to three bad shots for every good one the point is that you can't get great or even good shots even most of the time in this type of photography beginners beat themselves up over this and they shouldn't the great photos you see are the successfull ones picked from all the less successfull ones taken and it may be thousands secret nobody cares about the bad pictures try an approach something like i have outlined here and you just may surprise your teacher and yourself repeat secret take lots of pictures best to you vance  Street

my pictures came out with a yellowish tint i've got a decent digital camera mega pixels but for some reason a couple photos i took came out looking yellowish the photos are really nice but totally ruined by the ugly yellow tint i don't understand why because other pictures i took in the same area with the same amount of lighting don't look like that i have a fujifilm fine pix a camera i was indoors in a cafeteria at an elementary school the cafeteria has large windows that go from the floor almost to the ceiling the windows were behind me when i took the photo that came out yellowish would that cause an issue it was relatively sunny summer day everything white in the photo looks yellow there is a man wearing a white shirt but it looks light yellow everyone's teeth the whites of our eyes etc all look yellow the camera probably saw the parts of the photo lit by sunlight as 'white' and set the white balance for daylight which would make the parts of the photos lit by any tungsten light yellowish you can change the white balance or just do a color correction to make the shirts white again here are a couple tutorials on color correction to help you do that http graphicssoft about com od photoshoptutorialscolorcor photoshop color correction tutorials for correcting color and tone htm http www computer darkroom com tutorials tutorial htm  Color temperature Light-emitting diode Digital photography PNG Pixel Digital image editing RGB color model Photography Sunglasses Stereoscopy Blue Grace Cossington Smith Color theory Raw image format Enlarger Rendering (computer graphics) Adobe Photoshop Color Camera Gamut Bryce Warez NTSC Sun Color blindness Sunlight ImageMagick Technicolor Digital camera Photographic film Grayscale Daylight saving time Anamorphic widescreen Television Sundial Contact lens Black-and-white Apollo 8 IPod Digital cinema Camouflage Light Computer printer Wi-Fi Liquid crystal display GIMP Computer animation Glasses Surveillance Color space High-definition television Goatse.cx Columbine High School massacre Drawing Anaglyph image Zone system Black Diamond Black Mesa Research Facility Autostereogram Oscilloscope Solar power ATI Technologies Primary color Super 8 mm film Photograph Diamond enhancement Digital camera back 2D computer graphics Filter (photography) Pixel art Volleyball Cliff Richard Collectibles in Bionicle Charge-coupled device Dither Computer vision Albedo JPEG Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Cloud Tungsten Handheld Red Digital Digital cinematography Raster graphics GIF Domain Name System High dynamic range imaging Uniform Resource Locator Chrysoberyl White Glass View camera Darkroom Spyware Eye Leica

blown highlights when a highlight is blown all detail lost it is my understanding that the detail that was there is lost forever my girlfriend however insists that she can bring the detail back from a blown highlight by pulling curves in ps personally it's my opinion that she thinks she can because she can make the highlight look normal can i get a ruling on this is it possible to retrieve details in a blown highlight fhoto my question was not how to avoid blown highlights this i know this disagreement actually arose while i was helping a more inexperienced photographer interpret histograms and blinkies blown on the histogram anything above contains no additional information however some things that are apparently blown just below can be salvaged using curves shadow highlight which uses a totally different algorithm or a variety of other techniques further images that were shot in raw can sometimes have their highlights salvaged due to the increased dynamic range that is captured recorded just past the edges of the histogram and can be pulled back in during raw conversion other than that as the other answerers stated you can clone or burn but in that case you are disguising the blown highlights not recovering them so if its truly blown beyond even the increased dynamic range of the raw file if applicable then no it can't be recovered  Digital photography PNG Histogram Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Digital image editing Bob and George Megatron Autism Public-key cryptography Plame affair XML Expert system Linked list Classical music era Obi-Wan Kenobi Vegeta Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Windows Vista Scientology beliefs and practices Radix sort Memento (film) Professional wrestling match types Cognitive science Sin City Link (Legend of Zelda) Virtual memory Internal ballistics Automatic number plate recognition Dynamical system Logic Boba Fett Drill bit Wind power Artificial neural network Geographic information system Handloading Audio data compression Abduction Phenomenon Dither Glen Jacobs Curve Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Supply and demand Philosophy of language Algebraic geometry Database Second language acquisition Super Nintendo Entertainment System Holography Shawn Michaels Gravity Bubble Bobble Computer forensics Knife Labour economics Darth Vader The Invisibles MP3 Transformation problem Windows XP Transmission Control Protocol John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Day of the Daleks Items in the Metroid series Panoramic photography Black hole Stone Cold Steve Austin Fractal Microeconomics Digital cinema Datatype Land use forecasting Princess Zelda C programming language A Course In Miracles Aikido 9/11 conspiracy theories Rendering (computer graphics) Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 IBM PC compatible The Death Gate Cycle Piccolo Junior Saga Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Computer vision Drawing Humpback Whale Comet Normal distribution Password Raw image format Karl Rove OpenDocument Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Redundant array of independent disks Syphon Filter Planetary orbit Teller-Ulam design

how do i get into the modeling world i really want to b a model i am and want to b a model abercrombie that's probably a long shot right now but if u have any tips about what i can do thanx in advance p s i dont want to b a runway model just a model in ads and stuff like that i think that's called editorial modeling but idk p you can start modeling at but make sure that continuing your education is more important because good looks do not last forever plus make sure your parents are involved with your decisions modeling is not as easy as you think and you have to have the looks and the determination to stay in this field if you live near any major city there might be a modeling agency there but a lot of the big agencies are in la nyc chicago and atlanta because most of the major clothes designers and advertisers are in those areas also you don't have to have an agent or agency most of the time they think about themselves first not you if another model will get them more money they will send her to that shoot not all are bad but some are so you have to be care full what you do why don't you look at this website and look over some of the portfolios in there models and photographers get some professional images shot to start then find a couple of photographers in your area that you like their style of work and then contact a couple of them and see if they would be interested in doing a tfp time for prints or tfcd time for cd in other words you supply your time as a model he she as a photographer and you get images in return you will have to sign a model release so that you and he she can use the images in your case since you are under you be required to have a parent sign for you http www asmp org commerce legal relea if you do join as a model do not just go with the beginners portfolio but maybe at least silver level and update regularly http www onemodelplace com take a look at this one and read their faq it will give you many answers http www fordmodels com main cfm hope this helps kevin  Photography World Wide Web Domain Name System Common Unix Printing System Modelling agency Independent Media Center Advertising Open access Digital photography Plame affair Photojournalism Snooker HyperText Transfer Protocol Gmail Web crawler Craps The New York Times Legal research HTTP cookie Objective-C Undergarment Nike, Inc.

where can i find out how to electronically modify an sx alpha to use film as described in this post http lansingphoto blogspot com cameras i love polaroid sx html pop the nd filter off of the sensor to the right of the lens once you've done this you'll get correct exposures with film to load into the camera you can either slide the film pack in with an index card under it and then slide the index card out once the film pack is seated take a pair of diagonal cutters and snip the four small bumps off the front bottom of the film pack the sx is probably my favorite polaroid design ever and i converted one of mine using the above method it works great far better than the polaroids which came from the factory set up for film by the way for a less permanant alteration you can tape a stop nd filter over the lens this has the disadvantage of making the viewfinder darker though so it's an option i generally won't use  Photography View camera Digital photography SX-70 Digital single-lens reflex cameras Digital camera Floppy disk Macro photography Camera Single-lens reflex camera Leica Contax Photographic film Movie projector Canon EOS Common Unix Printing System Stereoscopy Large format Medium format Enlarger Photographic lens Canon T90 Oscilloscope Film speed Instant camera Windows XP HyperText Transfer Protocol Konica Minolta Cinematography Depth of field Sunglasses Parallax Raw image format Manual transmission Glasses Filter (optics) Shutter (photography) Sega Saturn Mars Exploration Rover Pinhole camera Sound effect Camcorder Hash table Color temperature Digital cinematography Windows 2000 Card game Eye TRS-80 Aberration in optical systems Exposure (photography) Anamorphic widescreen IPod Instant film Twin-lens reflex camera Panavision Printed circuit board Nintendo Revolution Television Bass guitar Slide rule Digital camera back Film Synthesizer Blackjack RGB color model Holga camera Panoramic photography Clementine mission David Hockney Gramophone record IBM 700/7000 series Point and shoot camera Charge-coupled device Poker jargon Cross site scripting Anaglyph image Polarization Traffic light Nintendo GameCube X86 assembly language Naval mine Telescope Galileo spacecraft IMAX Digital Solar eclipse Zoom lens Bluetooth Motion picture terminology Python programming language Starsiege: Tribes Electric motor Violin Sensor Bicycle lighting PlayStation Portable Sewage treatment Timeline of invention F-number

what is the difference between a linear and circular polarizing lens filter which one would be better for outdoor shooting they both do the same thing they just go about it in different ways the biggest difference that you should be concerned with is if you have a camera i'm assuming you have an slr that is auto focus linear polarizers can be used for manual focusing cameras but circular polarizers must be used with cameras that feature auto focus now you can still use a linear polarizer with an auto focus camera as long as you're focusing it manually you can use either type of filter with a manually focusing camera and get the exact same results a circular polarizer is simply a linear polarizer with an extra layer within the filter to convert the polarized light into circularly polarized light which allows the af and metering systems to function normally if you have just an example a canon eos rebel xti then you would need a circular polarizer the reason being unless you disengaged the auto focus and focused manually a linear polarizer would not allow your camera to meter or focus correctly circular polarizers because they convert the light coming through into convert it to circularly polarized light will not interfere with your metering and af systems so if you have an auto focus slr or dslr you'll need to get a circular polarizer if you're old school and still work with a manual film camera you only need to get a linear polarizer unless you plan on using it between a couple of different cameras this wasn't the best explanation of the matter but i hope it helped the answer below is wrong sorry to say the linear and circular aspect of the filter has to do with the filtering layers within the glass of the filter not the shape of the filter there are systems that use square filters but they operate in the same way as the screw on type there can be a square shaped circular polarizer you can change the strength or rotate a linear polarizer to get a variable effect  Digital photography Polarization Leica Canon EOS Digital single-lens reflex cameras Canon T90 Antenna (radio) Transformer Stereoscopy Macro photography Contax Single-lens reflex camera Konica Minolta Light-emitting diode Sun Eye Cinematography Manual transmission Depth of field Canon EF lens mount Stage lighting Analog-to-digital converter Filter (photography) Maxwell's equations Light Autofocus Loudspeaker Welding Nikon Corporation Color Sensor Point and shoot camera Optical coating Camera Carburetor Coordinates (mathematics) Canon FD Microphone Quantum cryptography Floppy disk Motion capture Solar power Advanced Photo System Panoramic photography Liquid crystal display Anamorphic widescreen Cell (biology) Technicolor Glasses Fluorescent lamp Linked list Aliasing Photographic lens Federal Standard 1037C Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Laserdisc Nuclear magnetic resonance Digital camera back Sewage treatment Planetary orbit Quantum mechanics Microscopy Faraday effect NTSC Monochromator IMAX Full frame digital SLR Vector (spatial) Mars Photographic film Supernova Canon PowerShot G Geology of the Moon Gravitational radiation Compact disc Canon EOS-300D Pentax Normal distribution Nikon FE Ozone depletion Orthogonal matrix Optical fiber Unix time Rangefinder camera Telescope Enceladus (moon) Slide rule Pinhole camera

what is your opinion of my photos please check out my photos and let me know if you have any suggestions on making them better i am wanting to eventually wanting to become a photographer thank you www capturedmomentsbylinda shutterfly com www capturedmomentsbylinda shutterfly com capturedmomentsbylinda shutterfly com they have a very snapshotlike look to them to be honest you make a very common mistake but one that can be fixed easily and with some practice don't put someone's head dead center in the photo leaving a few feet of blank space above them and cutting off their feet focus on the face then recompose putting their head about up for full body shots then you will get their feet in too and not have all that wasted space okay second thing you will need to do is move your subject farther away from the fence so it will not be as obtrusive in the photos using a wide enough aperture and a slight telephoto lens that should throw the background out of focus and isolate your subject better then when you compose a shot don't put any main subject straight up and down the center line put them off center a bit for more interest think of the rule of thirds just imagine your photo divided in a tic tac toe grid and put anything important along a line in the grid or better still at an intersection of lines in the grid again focus on the face and recompose okay people there's an easy way to get to the site scroll over where she posted the url and your mouse will reveal the entire url just copy and paste what you can see and you should be able to figure out what letters are missing from the end easy peasy after the dot it's just shutterfly com http www capturedmomentsbylinda shutterfly com action  View camera Tic-tac-toe Photography Eye Community card poker Digital photography Poker jargon HyperText Transfer Protocol Movie projector Equine conformation Marching band Canon EOS Tic-Tac-Dough Macro photography Photographic lens Konica Minolta Snooker Theory of conduct Aerial (dance move) Glossary of partner dance terms Apollo 8 Slashdot subculture On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Solar cell Milton H.

photo objects formats is there any universal photo object format i e i create photo objects in different applications but can't use them in any other application what can i save them in i tried tif but it merges them thanx what exactly do you mean by the term photo object if you are meaning photos that have a keyable background so that they can be superimposed on other pictures that you can get from sites such as photoobject net then yes there is no photo object format some image formats can have rgb and alpha such as tiff but you would still need an application like photoshop to actually extract the alpha information this is why the photoobject net site gives you a jpeg file and a b w png file with the mask you could use tiff or tga formats to save images with an alpha channel but not jpegs if you are just using photoshop this is no problem but most applications deal differently with alpga info and some dont see it at all  PNG Tagged Image File Format JPEG Image file formats ImageMagick Macromedia Flash Screenshot JPEG 2000 RGB color model GIF Raw image format Adobe Photoshop Photograph Digital photography Comparison of web browsers Enterprise content management PlayStation Portable Goatse.cx Pixel Microsoft Paint Microsoft Office Exchangeable image file format Lossy data compression File format Lossless data compression Windows Picture and Fax Viewer IPod Web page QuickTime Internet pornography JavaScript Stereoscopy Color space Color management Encapsulated PostScript Federal Standard 1037C GIMP Super Nintendo Entertainment System Windows Vista Steganography Geographic information system ITunes Chroma subsampling AmigaOS Windows bitmap Scalable Vector Graphics Portable Document Format IPod photo IPhoto Disk image AppleScript MP3 Database Data compression Moir__ pattern Adobe Systems Warez Photoshopping WavPack Internet Explorer Vector graphics MDAC Favicon Computer science Bluetooth Pixel art H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Serialization Domain-specific programming language StuffIt Comparison of layout engines (graphics) VirtualDub Resource fork Factory method pattern BRL-CAD Ontology (computer science) IrfanView Nuclear fuel cycle Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis XML Television PHP Astrophysics Data System Blog Object-oriented programming Web browser Gravitational radiation OS/2 Ajax (programming) Hubble Space Telescope DVD Finale notation program Photography Peer-to-peer Computer vision 2D computer graphics OpenDocument Crop circle

thoughts on a long exposure photo http www flickr com photos thejokker thats fine its an old shot of mine and i wasnt sure how much i liked it there is no real focal point in the photo your cover on the table stands out as well as your face but they just make your eyes wander back and forth between them too much your eyes should either immediately go to the focal point or have them led to it by the way the photo is composed in your photo my eye is lead no where it just keeps looking for something to lock onto and it's also a bad use of long exposure you face and body is blurry becaused you moved during the long exposure lighting seems good so there is no need for a long shutter speed but not all is bad i was looking through your photostream i too am a flickr com user and came across a photo i really really like http www flickr com photos thejokker in set it's good in every way i especially love the white outline of her head  View camera Flickr Photography Stereoscopy London Canon T90 Depth of field Shutter speed Film speed F-number Eyepiece Digital photography Butterfly HyperText Transfer Protocol Cinematography Macro photography Panoramic photography Aperture Professional wrestling throws Single-lens reflex camera Sutro Tower Konica Minolta Remora Suplex World Wide Web Equine conformation Domain Name System Enlarger Movie projector Professional wrestling attacks Time-lapse Professional wrestling holds Street photography Shutter (photography) Professional wrestling aerial techniques Automatic number plate recognition Uniform Resource Locator Shen Gong Wu Volleyball Saturniidae Exposure (photography) HTML element Drill bit Twelve Swords of Power The Long Game Rangefinder camera Columbine High School massacre Rafflesia Boxing Table tennis Knife Death Note 2005 Kashmir earthquake Snooker Glossary of climbing terms Tae eul ju Pinball Phishing Saccade Physical attractiveness Canon EOS Autopsy Contax Parallax Bhagavad Gita Mouse (computing) GunZ The Duel Color temperature Boom Town (Doctor Who) SX-70 Nikon FA Photo sharing Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Who Framed Roger Rabbit Spatial disorientation Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Website Railway signal Ajax (programming) PlayStation Portable Camcorder SAML Photographic lens Bad Wolf Wood carving Lens (optics) Billiards Photographic film Eye The Parting of the Ways Laser engraving Nikon FE Where No One Has Gone Before (TNG episode) Albinism Archery The Shining (film) Second Life Quotation mark

technical help please photographers ok i have an image to make it s an alcohol bottle clear with clear fluid in it the image is to be made for format will shot with that in mind for cropping later the shot is to have green grass bottom 's and sky the top third the bottle has to be top to bottom on the left side of the frame so haven t decided sky colour yet will properly set up hour before change of light so will collect with blue sky polarizer and then get the colour temp sky colour changes through till dark my favourite is iso f seconds on trannies will take both film and digi systems so please advise regarding the transparent translucent nature of the object its been a few years since i last did it do i need to use black off camera to give shape to the bottle polarizer effect small light sun source effect do i need to use reflectors etc photographers only this cant be made in photoshop fotogs will know why any links tips or links would be great a mr ace you would make a perfect assistant you make good earl grey thanks a heap i last did it years ago also will see if i can disburst you to the client dont think they will go for it but a will try airline ticket usa nz expensive keep you informed pack a suitcase thanks heaps mr s mr know it all i said it cant be done in photoshop and that fotogs whould understand why im a professional i get paid very well to make images like this because if you do that in photoshop then its blown up to billboard size it would look stupid you may not realise why and im not going into it thanks for the effort a thanks dr remember the absolute images a few years ago i have a month to get this image supposed to go home for a week or two soon but keep on delaying it made so will do a test shoot first great ideas thanks a i shot this in my first term at brooks i shot through a black screen to keep the reflection of my camera lights and art director from being in the bottle my guess you are going to have to use a x view camera and mm lens to get the perspective you need experiment with your digital camera to get the right light balance both in colour temp and quality scrims and reflectors and even some flash fill may be necessary this sounds like a shoot where you need an experienced assistant to set up the shot  Stereoscopy Movie projector View camera Parallax Photography IMAX Television Leica Digital camera Polarization Reflecting telescope Widescreen Photographic film Eye Digital single-lens reflex cameras Adobe Photoshop Traditional animation PNG Amateur astronomy Color Cinematography Color temperature Anamorphic widescreen Bong Photographic lens Liquid crystal display Single-lens reflex camera Camera Holography Depth of field Bryce Stage lighting Photograph Telescope Bicycle lighting Technicolor Apollo moon landing hoax accusations GIF Konica Minolta RGB color model Hubble Deep Field Nuclear weapon design Anaglyph image Mercury Atlas 6 Tests of general relativity Binoculars Amateur telescope making EIA-708 Enlarger Snooker Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Gravity Gamma ray burst Geographic information system Pixel DVD Luminiferous aether Lighting Digital image editing Computer animation Dundas Square Sun Drawing Cinerama Headlight Black hole Eyepiece Helicopter Gamut Medium format Extraterrestrial skies Asteroid Speed of light Teller-Ulam design Sprite (computer graphics) Aurora (astronomy) History of telescopes Isaac Newton's early life and achievements Solar eclipse NTSC Lightsaber Pinhole camera Solar power Bluescreen Windows XP Charge-coupled device Surveillance Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Federal Standard 1037C

changing the dpi resolution on a digital camera i am still a bit confused at the dpi resolution concept of a digital photo even on a megapixel camera using the highest resolution of x the jpeg quality and or if they are the same the dpi comes out at is it that some cameras do not have the capabilities of higher dpi so many sites like bay photo etc are talking about higher dpi numbers for better quality it is a digimax a megapixel camera resolution in a camera has nothing to do with dpi more megapixels in a camera simply mean that it can resolve more make sharper pictures all other things being equal which they seldom are when you print a picture the resolution of the picture itself is converted to the resolution of the printer which is almost always much more printers might go up to dpi but your eye can't distinguish that much it's just to make the picture look a little smoother dpi doesn't sound like a lot but in most cases of photographs its more than sufficient if you printed text or straight black lines at dpi you would see jaggies but in a photo you won't photo printers either the inkjet you use at home or the fancy one they use commercially always print at their highest resolution but the actual resolution you get is whatever the camera was capable of a better camera will look better  Pixel Digital photography Dots per inch Digital camera Dot matrix printer Konica Minolta Computer printer Raster graphics Digital cinema Photographic film JPEG Mouse (computing) Circle of confusion Image scanner Analog-to-digital converter Video Digital Digital video NTSC Image file formats Photography PostScript ImageWriter Movie projector Fax High-definition television Gamut Laserdisc Photograph Trademark Digital cinematography Anamorphic widescreen Raw image format 8 mm video format Stereoscopy DVD LaserWriter Common Unix Printing System Panoramic photography View camera Movie camera Widescreen Digital image editing Color printing Inkjet printer Machinima Road-rule enforcement camera Atari ST Digital camera back Computer Color management WYSIWYG Walkman Traditional animation Atari 8-bit family Camcorder Ebook Windows XP Multifunction printer Windows Vista Photojournalism PlayStation Portable MP3 PNG Macro photography Modem Geographic information system Apple Computer H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Foveon X3 sensor Moir__ pattern Typeface Charge-coupled device Motion capture Digital-to-analog converter Dither Camera Xerox TRS-80 Ricoh DV Color Computer numbering formats Display resolution Computer animation Technicolor Film preservation Musical Instrument Digital Interface Halftone Schneider Kreuznach Hubble Space Telescope RGB color model Medium format Single-lens reflex camera Television System/34 Sound Blaster Plotter

how do u merge different pictures into one picture with out spoiling its originality and clarity i'm not sure what you mean do you mean like taking something out of one picture and putting it in another like putting someone in front of a different background it's not hard to do in photoshop or similar photo editing software you open both pictures you 'lift' the foreground subject from one and drag it over the other then move it where you want it perhaps resize it clean up edges and you can even adjust brightness and contrast of just the foreground image to match the background after you've done it a few times it's easier  Digital image editing Movie projector Stereoscopy Drill bit IPhoto Goatse.cx Anaglyph image Digital photography Autostereogram Panoramic photography Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Adobe Photoshop Parallax Marching band GIMP Pornography Wassily Kandinsky JPEG Dog agility Automatic number plate recognition Kitesurfing Sextant Bryce Occultation Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Mouse (computing) Professional wrestling throws Traditional animation Photoshopping IPod Depth of field Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Skateboarding trick Oscilloscope Handloading Enterprise content management Professional wrestling holds Wind turbine Aerial (dance move) Mattress Glider PNG Opera (web browser) Badminton Fast bowling Swept wing Sonata form Violin PlayStation 3 Paramount Pictures Amateur telescope making MP3 Opportunity rover Photography Screenshot View camera Hubble Deep Field Photographic lens Anchor Hard disk Motorcycle Helicopter Breaststroke Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Cathode ray tube Macro photography Sailing Suplex Television Diamond Hash table Spirit rover timeline for 2005 March Yearbook Textile manufacturing Cheating in Counter-Strike Cinematography B3ta Finale notation program Chess terminology AmigaOS Jet engine Batting (cricket) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 NTSC Bicycle lighting Color Graphics Adapter Visual Basic Flight controls LaTeX Color Airbrush ASCII art Matte (filmmaking) The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Taxi Driver Deep Impact (space mission) Strap-on dildo Panama Canal

how much do photographers get paid every year which are the best high school courses to take which schools are the best to go in ontario canada like anything artistic the salary is dependent upon supply demand and talent in general the jobs that pay the most are also the least glamorous jobs with high personal satisfaction or ego support will generate less income than those that don't why because people will take less to do what they want to do rather than what others want them to do i taught photography for years and can say photography should be only a part of the curriculum if you wish to be successful you will need as much if not more preparation in business and marketing to succeed the schools with the best reputation in photography are not in ontario but new york rochester institute of technology rit and in california brooks institute of photography  Photography Education in Portugal High school Rochester, New York Graduate school Rochester Institute of Technology Education in the People's Republic of China Professor Education in the United States Unemployment Seneca College Juris Doctor Charles William Eliot College Education in Hong Kong Salary Community college York University Ryerson University Freeters Monroe County, New York Education in Australia Secondary education in Japan Inflation University of Pennsylvania Law School Education in Canada Digital photography Peterborough, Ontario Teacher Steve Jobs Queen's University Education in Germany Medical school Education in the Republic of Ireland Education in Japan Software engineering Master's degree __cole Polytechnique Ontario Academic Credit Montgomery Blair High School FairTax Oshawa, Ontario Gross domestic product Dr. Michael M.

must all questions be about photography in this section or can they be about things of general interest to photographers photographers obviously have their own point of view pun intended on many subjects and we encourage them to express that through photography why not other things there are things that can be said about other areas of life that will definitely be shaded by the filter that you select we can say things like that last sentence in a way that only another photographer would appreciate we expect to get questions about technique for our equipment including cameras lenses printers and software we expect to get questions asking for critique selling photography paying photographers finding photographers buying equipment or software we accept questions asking if someone is cute even though that has nothing to do with photography maybe it's okay if we say the person is interested in becoming a model even though we know that's not usually the case where do we draw the line yahoo expects us to police ourselves and report abuse to yahoo staff the first line in the community guidelines says yahoo answers is an online community in which participants ask and answer questions on a wide range of topics from the serious to the delightfully trivial if someone has a delightfully trivial question that only makes sense to another photographer would they post it in jokes and riddles or hobbies and crafts or here yahoo says that discussions belong in yahoo groups but we have learned a way around that over here should we stop creating discussions and leave this a cold and impersonal alcove of advice only in my other section i have my own way of dealing with questions that are not interesting to me i don't answer them i don't even read them it works for me and it might work for you in case you have never actually read the community guidelines it takes minutes http answers yahoo com info community guidelines php obviously this is a rhetorical question but any answers are wonderful yahoo calls this a community and then says not to have discussions or chat in this community i think we are finding a way to devlop a sense of community on our own how can the members of a community not know about each other or not want to know even more that's not much of a community is it david as you know i've develped my own little library of resources for those repetitive and boring questions i decided that many people come here with a specific question in mind and it's all that they can do to figure out how to post that question let alone search for identical questions that were already answered in fact i think i have enough in dentistry to publish a book or author a complete website the thing is i got so border with that i pretty much never go there any more cameras is getting that way and you can tell how much time i have on my hands by which questions i answer continued cont i often skip the easy best camera questions and spend time on the ones that i can learn something by answering or genuinely help someone else advance i just don't want this section to become boring to me also and yet there's something about this environment that i find more attractive than photog forums where we often find arguments and egos clashing christy i would not encourage commercial activity at all but i wish more of the active members knew more about each other or had a way to see their work mojo i find that this is a nice comfortable section most of the time i also find that i watch questions that i want to come back to so i can reconsider and add to my original answer or question others must be doing this as i find that we are actually discussing things back and forth instead of just taking a hit and run approach continued cont i guess we'll find out if there is any limit to how many details yahoo will let us add to our questions terisu i am so glad that i discovered this section i hope that cameras remains the place where people who apparently want the absolute best camera in the world but have a budget will go this section is buried under one more layer of sections so it's harder to find good i think you'll see me spend some of my points asking stupid or stimulating questions more often i'll try to rival antoni for ridiculousness or interestingness as flickr calls it antoni you've only been around for a month now but i am so glad that you discovered this section you sure perked things up in a hurry and you bring a very high level of experience with you that we will all benefit from i hope you have enough mastery of my language to know when i am being sarcastic with you by now too i may give you a thumb up where you don't appreciate it if you don't thanks dr except for christy you got some big guns to answer this trisu mojo ma ace all stars with alot of great stuff to give to this forum ok my favourite is whats the best camera or how do i get my photos to look like this a shot of anne geddes babies the constant questions about photoshop where people try to use a computer to do what a pro does with light and makes in the camera i have asked some humourous questions and been really disapointed how humourless people are here ok for me its the people who say i dont know what im talking about but ill rubish others and say what i want anyway oh and the racist rubish about my english if i make an effort to learn english why dont some native speakers my biggest peeve is the photoshopers who tell people to do things on the computer instead of learning photographic skiils oh and that fool we both

how can i increase the resolution of a picture without resize it i want my picture have dpi but donot change it size when adjust in photoshop it change its size and it is not meet the requirement in my homework can you have me most of the other answers miss the relationship of print size to pixel image size and resolution when you go to the image size dialog in photoshop look at the pixel dimensions of the top box which is width let's just say it is pixels look at the resolution towards the bottom and see what it is in pixels per inch lets say it's pixels that means your print will be inches wide get it image size divided by resolution print size okay so you need dpi dots per inch which is for printers but for here lets say that it is the same as resolution change the to the will also change and the inches will stay the same that's what photoshop does by default not what you want and easy to fix now just change the width top box back to the print size will change but the image size will be back to the original size that's what you want in review so just remember to look at the image size maybe jot it down then change the resolution then go back and change the image size back to its original size the description of this is longer than actually doing it resampling does not happen since the image size is the same so it does not matter if the box is checked when you uncheck the box the pixel dimensions on top are locked by photoshop so you simply change the resolution to and your done simpler yes but you may not understand the relationship as well at first and not all programs may have this feature i would use this method once you understand what you are doing  Pixel Dots per inch Mouse (computing) Digital photography Raster graphics Image scanner Digital image editing Autostereogram PNG 2D computer graphics QuickDraw Atari 8-bit family Stereoscopy Anamorphic widescreen TrueType Typeface Digital camera PostScript Original Amiga chipset Rendering (computer graphics) Stairway PlayStation Portable Aspect ratio (image) Halftone Computer printer Photography View camera Collision detection Light-emitting diode High-definition television Mac OS X Color Graphics Adapter GIMP Pixelation Adobe Photoshop Common Unix Printing System Hash table Windows Vista Portable Document Format Mandelbrot set Drill bit Paper size Bluetooth Palm OS Plasma display ZX Spectrum Pixel art WYSIWYG Windows Presentation Foundation Image file formats Windows XP Movie projector Opera (web browser) Anti-aliasing Manifold Radeon Mattress Moir__ pattern Video Inkjet printer Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Something Awful Forums Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Tagged Image File Format Intellivision Canal lock IPod Game Boy Floppy disk Hello world program United States dollar Intelligent design Xbox 360 Textile manufacturing Computed tomography Liquid crystal display ASCII art Danger Hiptop Killian documents Sega Saturn C programming language Drawing Vector graphics Map Traditional animation AmigaOS GIF Television Trademark Graphics ImageWriter MOS Technology VIC-II Web design Chair Java programming language

burning wedding pictures to a cd i recently shot a wedding last week i am trying to figure out how to burn all the images to a cd so that my clients can go to any store and print out photos as they please i don't know exactly what setting i need to use for each individual picture any help would be great maybe i should specify a bit further i understand the whole jpeg thing but where i am getting confused is that my camera takes pictures that print out at x i guess a default setting or something i use a nikon d if any of that matters in order for my clients to be able to print out a perfect x with the entire image i am having to add borders or crop down to an x i guess my question is should i resize all my photos before burning them to the cd or should i leave them as is and let the client set there preference when they go to make prints sorry i didnt make much sense with my first post its past my bedtime p if you arent going to edit the pics yourself just simply burn them as jpegs thats probably what they already are to your cd if they are raw files you will need to convert them to jpegs also known as jpg if you are using software that came with your camera and there is a setting for file size use the largest since that gives the best quality there are many classes for photography and postproduction many are affordable many camera stores offer them as well as your local community college in reference to the additional questionage first i am no pro but am working hard to be one part of what most photogs charge is not for just snapping a shutter but also for the post production and this is the real answer you are seeking to have a standard answer for all situations would be absurd or at the least dull i would look at each picture individually and asses any improvements i could make with the cropping tool theres a lot of work if you have pictures to edit but then again thats why people consider you a pro if you left it to a client to do they probably wont have as much of an eye for it as you do and therefore screw it up royally if you really wanted them to have the raw pics uneditted then thats your choice but i would edit at least a portion for different sizes some may not look as good x as they would x with cropping off of the sides you have to be the judge of what will look good and what wont i'm sure you have a few where one person was standing just a tad too close and you have their hand holding a drink in the reception or something you know what your doing now go do it  Digital photography JPEG Image file formats Windows XP PlayStation Portable PNG Raw image format Digital image editing Stereoscopy Photography View camera Konica Minolta Digital camera Screenshot GIF Common Unix Printing System Enterprise content management Windows Vista Password Xbox 360 GED Apple Computer Bluetooth DVD CPU cache Leica Camcorder Mouse (computing) Windows 2000 PlayStation 3 ITunes Danger Hiptop Panoramic photography Redundant array of independent disks IPod Extreme Programming AmigaOS Windows Server 2003 PIC microcontroller Microeconomics Movie projector Opera (web browser) Microsoft Office Glen Jacobs Theory of conduct Quotation mark QuickTime Drill bit Widescreen Hash table Adobe Photoshop X Window System Handloading Macro photography NTFS Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Java programming language Ebook Mozilla Application Suite Macromedia Flash Canon T90 Goatse.cx Photographic film Publishing IPhoto SAT Plame affair Blog Domain Name System H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Free will Dither Patricia Ford Discordianism Digital cinema Photojournalism Open source culture Modem Expert system JPEG 2000 Screenplay English grammar Electronic journalism Virtual memory Mac OS X Internet Explorer Oracle database Professional wrestling throws Geographic information system Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March XML

can you save this shot this is one of my favorite shots but it is a slide that has faded over the years the original was taken in or on ektachrome while hanging out of an airplane door at about feet up maybe it was feet i can't recall i have had an x version on display in my office for years and it has finally faded to muted shades of brown so i want to reprint the picture i have made one stab at editting for balance between light and dark levels and pumped up the contrast and saturation a little bit i added some orange in the blown out highlight of the sun reflection on the river i applied unsharp mask what would you do if this was your shot see the original and also edit no at this link http www flickr com photos samfeinstein tags cohansey antoni i hear you but read on kitty the point is to see if we can collectively some up with some ideas here as a learning exercise seamless see above this is one of my favorite shots but it is a slide that has faded over the years the original was taken in or on ektachrome if i could start with a better scan i would so i really appreciate your efforts if i had a time machine which is one of my frequent recommendations i'd go back and use a haze filter this was one fo shots i took to get the film out of the camera before i reloaded with plus x to shoot some skydivers for the newspaper my main subject would not present a problem with haze so i was not equipped for it continued cont i'll take your answer and go through this process myself as it is a great lesson in photoshop as far as your rendering i know that you have no memory of the scene and you didn't discuss it with me but you have preserved the fine detail of the highest clouds and i like the depth of the ground colors you lost the yellow of the sunset along the right horizon though i'd darken this just so the viewer isn't drawn to the whiteness of that area thank you for spending the time and contributing to my education vance i definitely like the winding river better in edit and certain things about the sky but looks more true to nature overall time machine i need one to take the shot over or at least scan the slide when it was new you need one to allow for hours today instead of the usual nurse in ky the lower of your edit looks god and then the top half is pretty much lost i know you didn't set yourself up for this but a group of us have decided that it is good to simply be honest with each other instead of saying how wonderful everything looks it's a learning process i hope you are not upset i do appreciate your result though as i can see what is possible for the foreground in my edit i used a couple of adjustment layers so i could preserve the detail in the areas where yours is now washed out save it i would start with a better scan first anyway i took your challenge and gave it some time to see what approach i would use i didn't try to do anything with the noise but i would have if this was something i had to do the process was about like this in photoshop cs duplicate background layer o adjustment layer set the hard light for contrast with a fairly radical adjustment to the curve adjustment layer are set to screen for lightning with a fairly radical adjustment to the curve duplicate visible layers as one layer use highlight shadow adjustment shadow set to lighten highlights reduced by duplicate layer and set new layer to soft light at collapse layers blue gradient applied the sky make a selection of the sky and sea make a new layer of the selection and apply a high pass filter out a radius of pixels set new layer to soft light collapse layers without having seen the original i have no idea how it really looked and not having discussed it i don't know the representation that would best fit your recall this is just an interpretation based on my experience with similar lighting conditions total time about an hour not including the time i wondered why i was doing this instead of working on my website this is the result http picasaweb google com vance lear shadowstemp photo authkey eqcasb jqte regards vance addendum okay now i have a better sense i don't think that just adding a sunset coloration will pull the viewer back from the sun and water glare it will help though so i did the following selected river and made a new layer of it and set it to screen used variations on this new layer to increase blue in the mid and highlight range so that it looked more like it was lit by the sky then i backed off the opacity until it looked about right in terms of tonality not to obvious the shape of the river and the added emphasis from lightening it pulls the viewer more towards the middle and bottom of the image created a saturation mask for the sky and sea which i used for an adjustment layer created a photo filter adjustment layer using the saturation mask and applied the orange filter varying the color intensity as seemed right this kept the blues of the sky from being effected too much by the orange filter this is a little more complete answer and here is the edit http picasaweb google com vance lear shadowstemp photo authkey eqcasb jqte this is only for illustration purposes only illustrating an approach the haze you see is from the broad glare created by the sun reflecting off the water and a haze or other filter 'cept polarizer would have only partially helped what you are really seeing is low level flare within the lens time for second adjustments min  Photography Opportunity rover Rendering (computer graphics) Technicolor PNG NTSC Solar eclipse Drill bit

what is dpi i wan to save a photo at dpi how do i go about doing that also how do i take a panoramic photo do i need a special lens or something dpi or dots per inch is very important in the world of printing where it refers to the actual density of dots within the boundaries of one square inch dpi is usually considered a standard resolution for prints in photoshop you need to go to image size and set the third parameter in document size to pixels inch and then save the image this should do the trick however if you don't wish to resize your image you should keep resample image unchecked else you will end up changing the pixel size of the image to take panoramic photos you either need a panoramic camera such as the hasselblad xpan or the horizon the noblex etc or shoot multiple pictures and stitch them together in photoshop or in another dedicated stitching software like the realviz stitcher in order to get good stitches you need to rotate the camera around the nodal point of the lens and not on its tripod screw this can be done hand held or by using special panoramic heads that fit onto profesional tripods  Panoramic photography Dots per inch Pixel Digital photography Mouse (computing) Image scanner View camera Digital camera Digital image editing Television Tagged Image File Format Autostereogram Anamorphic widescreen Photographic film Photography Computer printer Dot matrix printer Stereoscopy Photograph Adobe Photoshop Raster graphics Medium format Movie projector PNG 2D computer graphics Konica Minolta WYSIWYG Geographic information system Digital camera back Binoculars Halftone Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Windows Vista Eyepiece Pixelation Photographic lens Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Screw thread IPhoto Depth of field Floppy disk Liquid crystal display Panorama Opportunity rover Image file formats Aspect ratio (image) Cross-stitch Video Pixel art QuickDraw Single-lens reflex camera Screenshot Ebook Clementine mission Goatse.cx Logo programming language Pinhole camera PostScript Portable Document Format Rangefinder camera IMAX Shutter speed Normal distribution GIMP Canon T90 Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Atari 8-bit family Ray tracing Amateur astronomy 135 film Digital cinematography Eye Panavision Danger Hiptop Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Typeface Camera Bluetooth Bookbinding Drawing Apollo moon landing hoax accusations GIF Parallax Color Graphics Adapter Plasma display Camcorder Typewriter PlayStation Portable NTSC Street photography Wallpaper group Digital cinema Leica

how do i get started in light painting i have seen light painting in photographs and think it is a very interesting medium one that i would like to learn i have a digital rebel xt decent lenses mm mm image stabilized and mm macro lens and a speedlite ex flash i understand exposure aperture shutter speed iso and know pretty well how to use my camera any advice on how to get started in light painting will be appreciated hey thanks painting with light used to be really popular a decade ago although i still use it on occasion usually discretely to add a highlight to an area which is impossible to luminate with larger lights in terms of technique typically when you are painting with light you start by turning off or dimming all the lights in the studio next if you have a flash or a strobe pack you want to set it to a low setting realizing of course not all strobes are the same for mine i put it on power and i click the test button i would suggest you experiment with what flash setting works the best but the idea is not to capture every detail in the photo what you want is a very dim image what this will do of course is give you an overall but vary faint exposure from which you can work from of course when you fire the strobe the shutter on your camera has to be open although i usually use a large format or medium format camera a digital slr camera will work just the same in the case of your camera you will need to select a relatively small aperture around and then select a rather long shutter i usually find seconds sufficient but if i am painting in something rather difficult i will select a longer shutter speed perhaps around a minute or more your shutter speed is really dependant upon how strong your light source that you will be painting with for me i am using a hose master which is a fiber optic light painter you can use an led flashlight if you choose but the lightsource is usually rather strong and dispersed so i suggest you take some black tape to block some of the light and to try to make the beam more small and focused anyhow painting with light just requires a lot of experimentation even with a lot of experience doing this there really isn't any specific guide to painting with light  Single-lens reflex camera Canon T90 Movie projector Leica Photographic lens Stereoscopy Bicycle lighting Aperture Panoramic photography Konica Minolta Canon EOS Stage lighting Contax Floppy disk Light-emitting diode Camera Street photography Digital camera Depth of field Macro photography F-number Film speed Gamma ray burst Cinematography Camcorder IMAX Digital single-lens reflex cameras Nikon Corporation Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Laser Exposure (photography) Anamorphic widescreen Shutter (photography) Film Enlarger Mouse (computing) Optical fiber Nikon FM2 DVD Aberration in optical systems Explosive material Traffic light Canon EF lens mount Eyepiece Telescope Nikon FA Canon T70 Photographic film Binoculars Lens (optics) Lighting Lightning Black hole Light Eye Nikon FE2 Sun Antenna (radio) Traditional animation Ultraviolet Oscilloscope MP3 Point and shoot camera Welding Synthetic aperture radar History of telescopes Secure Digital card Television Electrophysiology Galileo spacecraft Lightsaber PlayStation Portable Automatic number plate recognition Astronomical seeing Modelocking Nuclear explosion Red-eye effect M16 (rifle) Zoom lens NTSC USB flash drive Diffraction High-definition television Color Transmission electron microscopy Observational astronomy

comments please everyone the following was taken from an answer to my last question by pbifotoartist part of the reason you get bad marks is that your sentence structure and grammar are really bad and people have trouble figuring out what you are trying to say i understand that english is probably not your native language but if you are going to participate in an english language discussion group you should make a better attempt to communicate so people can understand you ok i am sorry this is my second langauge been writing typing only a few years and speaking english for i try very hard to explain my answers and use good english should i keep my knowledge to myself because my english isnt good enough for you guys or is that just a personal attack please be honest i know my english is not great i think the person has issues race or something jealous i dont know promise to be mature and accept all answers with respect many thanks beena and dr sam many thanks i thoough it was some sort of immaturity or something dr sorry my friend i had to read all your answer your a demi pro to me many thanks your answer means alot to me can someone explain what qed means doug and ara thanks i enjoy your answers alot so honoured by your reponses thanks doug your a man of facts i really like that i dont know latin haha thanks for the qed thing i know that there's been a lot said about your english because i contribute to similar areas to you and i know that i have also said that you ask the odd strange question that does not mean you don't have interesting questions to respond to or interesting answers it would be a shame if you didn't continue to contribute qed is an abbreviation of the latin phrase 'quod erat demonstrandum' meaning 'which was to be demonstrated' it is normally used in formal proofs particularly in branches of mathematics as a reminder to the reader of the proof that you have finally got the the point of proving what you had set out to do sometimes the phrase is misused in the sense of 'this proves my point' at which point you might consider that the person who has done so may not entirely grasp the linguistic niceties of its real meaning  Q.E.D.

shutter priority on nikon d x help ok so i was wondering if i could take pictures of stars by leaving the shutter open for seconds or so but the only time it takes pictures is when its able to focus on something i switched the lens switch to manual but nothing showed up if this is the case then does that mean i will have a hard time photographing lightning or is it because i had the polarizer filter on could i have the uv one on without it blocking out stars or lightning i am confused my last camera i could switch it to shutter priority and then star shooting but this one seems to want something to focus on instead of darkness you are switching the lens to manual focusing you need to rotate the control dial at the top to m for manual settings shutter priority is the s on the dial by the way here's a great d and d x users guide i suggest you print out and keep i did the same with the d and d guides from the same website http www kenrockwell com nikon d users guide index htm hope this is helpful if you have any more questions please ask  Canon T90 Digital photography Leica Shutter speed Photography Nikon FM2 Canon EOS Nikon FE2 Stereoscopy View camera Konica Minolta Nikon FA Camera Nikon FE Nikon Corporation Single-lens reflex camera Panoramic photography Photographic lens Stage lighting F-number Nikon FM Federal Standard 1037C Amateur astronomy Enlarger Movie projector Depth of field Cinematography Mouse (computing) Shutter (photography) Pinhole camera Canon EF lens mount Cinerama Point and shoot camera Time-lapse Film Aperture Panavision Digital camera Twin-lens reflex camera Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Lightsaber Film speed Apollo 8 Shutter angle Macro photography Television Street photography Canon PowerShot G Lens (optics) Camcorder Anamorphic widescreen Traffic light Digital camera back Lighting Charge-coupled device Eastman Kodak Gamma ray burst Binoculars Domain Name System Railway signal Parallax Embedded system Common Unix Printing System Redundant array of independent disks Apollo 15 Apollo Guidance Computer Telephone exchange Logo programming language World Wide Web Hard disk Polarization Secure Digital card ALGOL 68 Spyware Canon FD Exposure (photography) Wiki Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure GunBound IMAX Glasses Vertical service code Uniform Resource Locator Starfleet ranks and insignia B3ta Diablo II M-209 Technicolor Danger Hiptop BitTorrent Aurora (astronomy) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Autostereogram Web crawler

digital camera filters ok so i have three filters for my new camera and i kinda have a basic understanding but i was hoping for someone to explain them more and maybe give examples of when to use them they are uv filter flourescent polarizer a uv filter serves primarily as a lens protector it's totally transparent to visible light so it has no effect on the color balance of the image when used with film it could sometimes have the effect of removing a blue cast from an image digital normally has no uv sensitivity though so it really does nothing other than protect the lens a fluorescent filter is used with color film to correct for the color cast of fluorescent lighting and make the photos taken under fluorescent look more neutral with digital it really serves no purpose since you can adjust this in camera using the white balance function a polarizer has two primary functions in photography the first is to remove reflections from non metallic surfaces windows water etc the second is that it can be used in certain scenes to increase color saturation in particular it will darken a blue sky and remove reflections from green foliage to make it appear more green  Photography Filter (optics) Digital camera Color temperature Polarization Color Filter (photography) Digital photography Technicolor Stereoscopy Cinematography Enlarger Gamut Sunglasses Microscopy Glass View camera Fluorescent lamp Rendering (computer graphics) Ultraviolet Pixel Camera Liquid crystal display Anaglyph image Infrared Charge-coupled device Laser Color blindness Stage lighting Leica Macro photography Telescope Film Television Observational astronomy Konica Minolta Optical coating NTSC Sun Anamorphic widescreen Oscilloscope Glasses Fluorescence Light Ray tracing Color space Movie projector Dither Antarctic krill Depth of field Digital image editing Fluoroscopy Diode Photographic lens Eye Color theory Motion picture terminology RGB color model Computer animation Diamond Aurora (astronomy) Canon EOS Camcorder Holography Reflecting telescope PNG Lightsaber Bicycle lighting Clementine mission Headlight Traditional animation Rainbow Raw image format Photograph Cloud Eyepiece Panoramic photography Parallax Digital cinema Confocal laser scanning microscopy Computer vision Federal Standard 1037C Contax Cassini-Huygens Optical phenomenon Film speed Zoom lens Iris (anatomy) Bayer filter

what camera is used on lifetimes side order of life it's funny that i saw the show one time and she spent a lot of time in the darkroom but the promotional photo that i see on lifetimetv com shows a strap that reads just digital okay i watched the show until i saw her camera it is a nikon f with a photomic tn finder it is sometimes called the nikon f photomic the bulging finder includes the meter along with its batteries in my opinion this was the absolute worst design as far as ergonomics were concerned and i have no idea how they sold cameras oh wait they didn't sell them they gave them away seriously i borrowed one from a friend before i made my major purchase and i too kthe film out after only about shots and said thanks but no thanks the best part about the camera which is indeed an icon was that you could use nikon lenses which were indeed without equal the poor design of this camera is what drove me to pentax which is what the rest of the world was using anyway and formed a year bias against nikon  Digital photography Nikon Corporation Nikon FA Camera Leica Konica Minolta Single-lens reflex camera Digital single-lens reflex cameras Canon EOS Nikon FM2 View camera Rangefinder camera Nikon FE Canon T90 Photography Nikon FM Binoculars Pentax Nikon FE2 Advanced Photo System Photographic lens Canon Inc.

copyright pros only thanks so i answered a question about copyright i been in the business a while so make a point of knowing the laws affecting my trade i answered if the photographer is commissioned to make the image the client owns it if the fotog does it off their on back they own the work two people were photoed on a boat then sold a print who owns the copyright i answered unless the people signed a model realease then the image can not be sold as theres no rights to sell dont really make sence i know but thats the gust isnt it a hobbiest rubished me said there is a copyright the fotog owns it then said he aint a laywer and dont ask things on answers as people dont know what they are talking about now im ready to be humbled here was i wrong is it right for some fool to rubish me then admit they dont know what they are talking about yeah yeah tell me to calm down thats cool but really whats your angle on the walk up shots rights many thanks in advance that first answer is an example of stupidity and talking about something they know nothing off the next two are great answers many thanks guys bizhead shame your guessing and your right the guy is a tosser thanks heaps pbi yes it is my second langauge so im sorry about that as far as not using this forum cause i have only been using this langauge for a few years and my english isnt great why dont you be more positive and say great you share your knowledge here even though its extremely difficult for you some times what are you kkk you heard of race relations peace love and goodwill to all man not depending on there latin chinesse or english if you ever venture overseas be grateful people tolerate you not speaking their langauge you say im confusing have you read your answer the answer is in dr sams answer in one sentence a thanks doug you put it how i wanted to my understanding english not as good as yours you proberly smarter than me also is exactly how you put it the details you give are exactly what i believe and have worked with in many countries thanks alot doug first of all you weren't wrong however there are exceptions to the rule about the people on the boat which some fine art photographers get away with citing fair use in lawsuits a good example would be the photography of diane arbus in particular her candid shots of people on the street however fair use should be used with extreme caution as it is really subject to interpretation and local right to privacy laws may trump this particular law however in the case of this being a commercial photo shoot where the image is used for monetary gain then like you said if a model release was not signed you are in a world of trouble in terms of who owns the photo and whom can profit from it so anyhow in terms of us copyright law as well as japanese copyright law the country of which i am currently residing in who owns the copyright is based upon the terms of the contract or in some cases whomever it is that you employed under lets take for example the fsa photographers of the 's and in particular the photographer dorothea lange if you go to the library of congress you can actually get a real print of one of the most famous photos ever taken migrant mother all of this is done without consent of the estate of dorothea lange why well part of working for the fsa in terms of the employment contract was that the photographer relinquishes all rights to any photos they take while employed under the federal governments farms securities administration so basically the federal government can do whatever it chooses with the image even going so far as to charge a meer for an original print of a dorothea lange photograph at least that is what i was charged way back when and it is a real silver gelatin print of course there are other ways a photographer can relinquish ownership of their photographs one can relinquish their right to a photograph by simply stating in the terms of the job contract that they relinquish all ownership of the image some clients will personally ask for this but rarely should this ever be done unless you have taken serious thought as to the potential value of the image weighed against the immediate economic benefeit of relinquishing your rights  Public domain Copyright Photography Copyright law of the United Kingdom Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Intellectual

i need some opinions on the same photo hey its me again for those who answered my countless questions i have another question now i know imma get so much heat about these photos being more so graphics design but i honestly only did two things to the photos besides the obvious design i only removed blemishes and changed the hue to black and white so please know that i did think abut post production any who im getting ready to scoope out an fashion agency who was interested in my photos they said it didn t matter how much work i had but i wanted a little more photos in my book it s a job being a paid assistant photographer so i needed to know which one of these photos would be a little better for my book please be honest but not brutal to the point where i don t gain anything out of your comments keep in mind im still an amateur http img imageshack us img number fg jpg http img imageshack us img pl jpg http img imageshack us img qf jpg helloo did i not just state to be constructive yeah anyone can sit there and talk s about something but if you honestly don t know what your talking about don t know how to help the person gains nothing but a slap in the face give your comment and let the person know how they can improve so if anyone else just whats to be blunt take your comments else whereon need them if im not gonna learn i like the second one the best i think you should have put more life into your photos no offense they just need something that people will be drawn towards the person i don't know if that's you in your pictures looks bored even while being refreshed with water more emotion and your pictures will come to life good luck sorry for being picky but that's what i do other than that your pictures were good  Theory of conduct Joke Internet troll Teen Girl Squad Donald Rumsfeld Whose Line Is It Anyway?

professionals only thanks metering how do you do it are you auto light meter what type a grey card or white or black i do hand readings palm always do you so do you do it manually do you ever bracket can you hand read exposure if you spot or center weight auto in my books what do you point the camera at i will edit things in so beware like if i get an answer i center average manaualy or something save us all and just say you use auto ceneter weight and bracket or what not thanks in advance a thanks mr ace a question for the talented like you so when you spot meter you point at what you want exposed right but not if its black or white right thanks for your answer my friend a doug many thanks grey card i like what you mean you lose control the control is using the reading to control depth and speed dont sound very scientific waving camera around but if your getting good exposure who can argue that great answer many thanks a larry me old sport appreciate your answer alot as you say grey card is solid im the other way never bother with a card cause my palms always with me and always solid for me i really like your bit about highlights and shadow etc nice work larry thanks for your answer well done a dr sam you are always welcolme here just dont want the usual answers like just put it on auto auto the thief of good image making thanks a heap wow years loving trannies my respect for you just went cosmic nice to hear from you pbi are you ok in the head department teaching ametuers to expose positives by sensing the light in one session and how you they go without you calling out numbers a week month year later you may fool the ametuers frankly sounds like trumpet blowing and phony yo sport an awful lot of metering madness here to be brief it definitely depends on the subject matter and the effect that i'm shooting for here i have several meters and when i actually use them a great deal of the time i rely on my years of experience and the familiarity that i have with my equipment and past results i will call on either the camera's meter an older wein flash meter or and older minolta multi meter when i use a card it is always an grey this has always given me rock solid results i've done the hand metering trick on occasions but only when i've been in a situation without a grey card i do bracket on a lot of subjects experience over time has taught me that there is certain subjects and situations that can be much improved with a slight tweak that this action allows and it is much better to have the results right there than to go tweaking for them in the dark or in a digital program in the action you asked about here with spot metering a great rule of thumb at least for me has been to read the darkest shadow area then read the brightest highlight area and then set the math to where the center is between the two readings this will down play the brightest points to a more mellow gauge and bring up the hardest shadow areas to at least some slight detail while keeping the balance within the primary subject matter in detail of course there are those situations that you want the shadow areas to go blacked out or the highlight areas to go white out in those situations spot read the most noticeable mid toned of the subject of focus and let those upper and lower registers go blotto hope this helps somewhat and if critiqing answers here go easy on me i'm old and i bruise easily  Digital photography Konica Minolta Leica Photography Canon EOS Stereoscopy Poker jargon View camera Volleyball Theory of conduct Extreme Programming Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Floppy disk Modem Magic (illusion) CPU design Contract bridge Bicycle lighting PlayStation 2 Determinism Timpani Metering mode Blackjack Scientology beliefs and practices Clarinet Weight training Beatmania IIDX Computer and video game genres Whose Line Is It Anyway?

photography techniques how to capture a shot of the sun i am new to photography and i would like to know how to shot a picture of say the setting sun my manual says do not shot a picture of the sun or look at the sun through the lens but i see photos of the rising or setting sun how to do this without photo shop can i use filters or what thanks p s i use a sony cyber shot dsc h you need a filter like a neutral density graduate to properly expose both the sky as well as the ground the camera can only expose for one or the other unaided the nd graduate filter has a grey coating that graduates from dark to light and serves to stop down the brightness of the sun and sky in order for everything else to be properly exposed the dark end of the filter would be used for the sky the clear end for the ground without a filter of this nature when you expose for the sky the ground will be under exposed and without detail when you expose for the ground the sun and sky will be over exposed and blown out despite the fact that the model of your camera will not accept a standard threaded style filter there are alternatives you'll have either research any accessories that may be available for use in this situation or improvise just get a nd graduate slot type square from wolfcamera cost around and simply hold it in front of the lens of your camera while it is attached to a tripod a must for this type of shot due to the slower shutter speed either way filters are the way to go also as the user manual suggests never point the camera directly at the sun without a filter as it will damage the live preview ccd image sensor  Photography Digital photography Digital camera View camera Stereoscopy Charge-coupled device Leica Camera Sun Panoramic photography Photographic film Floppy disk Camcorder Shutter speed Solar eclipse Digital single-lens reflex cameras Canon T90 Time-lapse Technicolor Amateur astronomy Macro photography Anamorphic widescreen Polarization Panavision Cinematography Konica Minolta Single-lens reflex camera Filter (optics) Parallax Canon EOS Manual transmission Exposure (photography) Filter (photography) Film speed Cassini-Huygens PlayStation Portable Depth of field Observational astronomy Stage lighting Combine (Half-Life 2) Eye Galileo spacecraft Mouse (computing) Automatic number plate recognition Eyepiece Photographic lens Hubble Space Telescope Gamma ray burst Sunglasses Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Modem Shutter (photography) Television Hard disk Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Pixel Point and shoot camera Binoculars Black hole Digital camera back Aurora (astronomy) Color Color temperature Digital cinema Oscilloscope Huygens probe Drill bit Tank Street photography Professional video camera Film Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Pinhole camera Photograph Gravity Dundas Square Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure Infrared Motor oil Rangefinder camera Neutrino Traffic light Nintendo Revolution Medium format Starfleet ranks and insignia Gamut Screw Aperture E85 NTSC Motion capture Pornography

i'm going to be photographing a farmers market and the pictures will be published on a website magazine and cookbook the amount of hours will be not including time for editing what would be a reasonable rate to charge for this hi everyone sorry i should have clarified this the total amount of hours will be over the span of different days i have photographed this farmer's market before for their newsletter and they liked my pictures sorry i didn't include this is the question and thanks so much to the sarcastic remarks everyone has to make a start doing something and i'm slowly making mine and trying to get additional info i know that i'm an amateur photographer i also know that i'm not over my head every photographer has been in amateur at some point and have been over their head in something i thought i was going to agree with joe l but i'd say a couple hundred dollars per hour is more like it you could easily spend an equal amount of time in post production if i was the one paying you though i'd say to get as many shots as you need inside of two hours if i were you i'd think along the same lines man hours is a long time unless you're spending it the way they did in the movie by the same name maybe you can stop by a few times throughout the day and catch different activities from the buyer's point of view i'd ask how many shots they will get as a result of hours of your time it would have to be dozens to make it worth having you there that long who set the hours anyway  Microeconomics The Amazing Race Labor theory of value Supply and demand Labour economics Inflation High-definition television Poker jargon Photography John F.

how do you remove shadows in photoshop i took several photos taken at a decent quality resolution but one was at the wrong angel and the sunlight cast some major shadows what is the easiest way to remove them or at least minimize their appearance in photoshop every web site i find has a pretty lengthy explanation but i know one of the settings has to offer a quick albeit slightly basic fix look at the shadow highlight tool under the image adjustments drop down this is probably the easiest way to pull up those shadows if you want to be especially clever about it create a duplicate layer of your image run the shadow highlight tool on the duplicate then turn it into a layer mask an option at the bottom of the layers window and use the paintbrush with black and white to mask in or out certain sections of the effect so that you can apply it selectively  Adobe Photoshop PNG Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Windows XP Windows Vista IPod Visual Basic Screenshot Cathode ray tube Windows 2000 Digital photography Amateur telescope making GIMP Digital image editing Hubble Space Telescope AmigaOS Photography B3ta Nintendo Entertainment System OpenBSD Common Unix Printing System JPEG 2000 Drill bit Pottery Transmission Control Protocol Python programming language Bryce Mouse (computing) Microsoft Office Stereoscopy Lighting MAME Application-specific integrated circuit Toa Extreme Programming Apollo moon landing hoax accusations MP3 Netfilter/iptables Knife Eye Macromedia Flash Casting Strap-on dildo Poker jargon Compiler optimization ITunes Upholstery Debugging Hash table Ultraviolet Trademark Mattress Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Naruto jutsu XML Google Maps 2D computer graphics Macromedia Fireworks Laser engraving Bong Wireless Application Protocol Mac OS X Atari 8-bit family Anchor Prisoner's dilemma Cheating in Counter-Strike Bob and George Naval mine Technicolor Mach kernel Geographic information system BASIC programming language Inflation Hello world program Sundial De Lorean DMC-12 Portable Document Format BitTorrent Glossary of firefighting equipment Final Fantasy magic Table saw Computer forensics Human skin color Microsoft Paint Anamorphic widescreen System 7 (Macintosh) Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara EIA-708 ImageMagick Wiki Rendering (computer graphics) Photolithography Bicycle Glossary of climbing terms Microscopy DVD Firewall (networking) 3dfx

b w photos tips i know two ways of creating b w photos using the black and white feature on my camera desaturating it in photochop either way it ends up being very flat i tried playing with the curves and levels in ps but it just ends up looking weird unnatural i always see these stunning b w photos with great contrast and i was wondering how i can achieve that or maybe it's cuz im not using a slr i dont know this would depend on which version of photoshop you use not all are created equal in terms of b w conversion photoshop lightroom elements and cs all have improved b w conversion engines with more ways to adjust individual tonal effects and colors i too am working on my b w work have been for months so i feel your pain bro i use photoshop lightroom and shoot in raw this way i can use the most of the available color information while desaturated programs like lightroom that automatically work with raw files do not discard the color information when desaturating and are known as 'non destructive' editing programs retaining the original digital negative as the primary layer adjusting the various color sliders can achieve pretty dazzling effects with contrast especially darker colors like blue and magenta that is the main reason for not using your camera's b w option the camera will discard almost half of the information captured by the image sensor including the color information which you wouldn't think would be important to you when desaturating but believe it or not that color information is crutial to having the ability to create slight color hues in your b w images also you may want to look into getting an slr so you can shoot in raw format unless your present camera can do so believe me despite most peoples intimidation with using that format you'll love how much image information is retained once you learn how to use it with the right tools it's easy and you'll never go back to jpeg fine for your serious work and the more image data you have to play with the better your work will be using contrast is really important as well and if you can use threaded filters a circular polarizer works wonders for rendering beautiful contrast if your camera can't use a threaded filter there may be specialized accessories for your camera that you can use to achieve the same effects worse case just get a square linear filter and hold it in front of your lens while you compose your shots just know the orientation of the filter and you'll get the same effect as a threaded polarizer well i hope this helps and i hope a b w pro answers your question as well maybe we could both learn peace  Adobe Photoshop Stereoscopy Color Digital camera Digital image editing Photography PNG Technicolor Raw image format Pixel Leica Drawing Polarization IPod Canon EOS Macro photography NTSC Anaglyph image Cinematography RGB color model Konica Minolta Floppy disk Screenshot PlayStation Portable Color theory Movie projector Stage lighting JPEG 2000 Gamut JPEG Single-lens reflex camera Hard disk Anamorphic widescreen Image file formats Windows 2000 MP3 Advanced Photo System B3ta Lightsaber Windows XP XML ImageMagick Mars Exploration Rover Filter (photography) Canon T90 IPhoto Game Boy Macromedia Flash Digital single-lens reflex cameras Color temperature Camouflage Wassily Kandinsky DVD Television Photographic film Enterprise content management Bayer filter Digital camera back Portable Document Format Analog-to-digital converter GIMP Atari 8-bit family Geographic information system ITunes Nikon Corporation Widescreen Panoramic photography Contax 2D computer graphics Light-emitting diode Photographic lens Rangefinder camera ATI Technologies Common Unix Printing System Blog Dither Bluetooth Radar Second language acquisition Autofocus C programming language Java programming language Motion capture H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Rendering (computer graphics) Objective-C Sega Saturn Eye

photoshop i use photoshop to edit my pictures and sometimes the edges are cut off when i print a x picture at a one hour photo sometimes important stuff may be cut off like text how can i prevent from losing part of the picture thank you for your help i would think the store kiosks etc are going to accept and interpret any dpi that you give them crop to the size you want and save the file before you go to the store see this brief tutorial http www flickr com photos samfeinstein try this with one or two prints using different sizes and see how it works out you can probably preview the print before you actually print and pay for it so you can bail out if it's not going to work then you should ask someone in the store how to size your prints to get them the way you want hopefully you will find someone who knows what they are talking about many people ask why their prints do not match their original images why are the heads cut off when i get prints made from my pictures this is a common problem with the typical point and shoot camera the standard sensors in point and shoot digital cameras create an image with an aspect ratio of this means that one side measures units in length and the other measures units in length this would be perfect if the print was going to be x or some multiple of that like x a less obvious size would be x or x flickr actually offers this print size if you select more options you will see an option called xd where d is the odd size and it will fit the proportion of your original image if you want to get a decent print from another processor where you only have standard sizes to choose from you will have to compose to allow for some loss of your image study my example as you read along this picture is just a snapshot that was taken without much regard for composition it is just a typical grab shot at a family party you will see that there are key elements at the extreme top of the frame and at the extreme bottom of the frame with this perfect comosition if we want a common size print made we will have to choose between losing some of the top of the subject's head or most of the interesting cake that is the focus of her attention or some of each i drew lines and shaded out portions of the photo to match the proportions of the most common prints the x and x are labeled and the black line is the x crop line which is not labeled this is just how it works if you want to have the entire subject from the top of her head to the bottom of the cake in the final print you would have to allow for some loss at the top and or the bottom when you take the picture in the first place if you usually get x prints you will have to allow the most extra coverage in your shot x would require somewhat less extra coverage and x would require almost no extra at all many of the newer point and shoot digital cameras allow you to choose your proportions or aspect ratio if you select it is easy to see that you can get an exact print of your original image at a x size a x would loose some off of the horizontal aspect similar to the example above but a x would loose some off of the vertical aspect if you had a similar composition on a image which is typical of most digital slr's and mm film by the way this would mean you could get rid of the black space to the left of the main subject as long as you anticipate this image loss that will occur when you have your prints made the final result will be a picture that pleases you plan ahead i left this picture in the original size just so it can also be used as a sample of a mp image

photography question please help d i'm going to start a photography club at my school and i need ideas to keep people interested but nothing that's going to cost a lot of money does anyone know how to set up a dark room easily or does anyone know of a place that might donate a camera to a school please tell me as much as you know thanks so much cameras can be really cheap old rangefinder mm cameras on ebay are only like and you can take great pictures with them and they are relatively rugged adn can take a lot of abuse which is important also they are not totally automatic so you learn to focus and to set f stop and shutter speed something every photographer should know about you can go on field trips that's relatively cheap go to an interesting old neighborhood or a park with trees and flowers afterwards have a 'show' where everyone shows or photos and perhaps everyone can sit in a circle and pass the photos around and talk about them you can go on trips to museums to look at photography exhibitions also and then hold discussions afterwards we used to do that when i was in school a dark room is pretty easy to set up especially if you have a room without windows you need a lot of stuff trays safelights chemicals developing tanks its mostly not expensive but it adds up the biggest expense will be the enlarger but i'm guessing you could find that too on ebay or craisglist since there are a lot of photographers who have 'gone digital' in the last few years and have an old enlarger in the closet gathering dust actually i really think old fashioned film based photography is on its way out i used to love printing pics in the darkroom but with digital photography it's just sooo much easier also much cheaper so instead of a darkroom you might have a couple of computers set up with gimp like photoshop but free and a photo printer it's not only faster and easier but cheaper plus the members will all have a computer at home so they can work on their photo editing skills there you might pool your money to invest in a film scanner so people can take mm pics just get the film developed then edit and print them on the computer well i could go on and on but this should be enough for a start  Photography Digital photography Konica Minolta Camera Enlarger Digital single-lens reflex cameras View camera Digital camera Darkroom Stereoscopy Macro photography Computer Photograph Single-lens reflex camera Rangefinder camera Canon T90 Photographic film Street photography Image scanner Floppy disk IPhoto Adobe Photoshop Medium format Charge-coupled device Panoramic photography Exposure (photography) Pornography Henri Cartier-Bresson Bluetooth Traditional animation Screenshot Linked list Digital cinematography Movie projector Plastic Technicolor Apple Macintosh Hash table Photo manipulation Cinematography Depth of field Computer printer Photojournalism Wind turbine Shutter speed F-number Film Digital art Windows XP Color temperature Widescreen IPod Atari ST Embedded system Universal Studios Photography and photographers of the American Civil War Atari 8-bit family CPU design F-16 Fighting Falcon BASIC programming language Gamut Topps Mach kernel Cinerama Theory of conduct Time-lapse Dot matrix printer Film speed Common Unix Printing System Oscilloscope GIMP Wheel of Fortune Project Gutenberg Geographic information system Eastman Kodak Holography Panavision Contax Compact audio cassette George Lucas Hydrogen economy Instant camera Nikon Corporation Advanced Photo System Canon EOS Pixel RISC

what is best lens for photographing sports have a canon rebel xt with mm lens i have a digital canon rebel xt efs mm lens mm lens mm and a mm lens i take pictures of my sons midget football team and also college football i have been looking at tube extensions and close up lenses to get some better shots any suggestions of what i could add to any of these thanks what you already have should be sufficient for the application you have a cheap solution if you need to get closer is to buy a teleconverter possible a x or a x that will increase your focal length and get you a lot closer if you're really serious about this kind of thing however you're also into big bucks the true sports photographers use dedicated telephotos mm to mm that are also fast lenses f usually the problem is that those are hellishly expensive costing several times what your camera cost which focal lengh you choose depends on how far away the action usually is from you the farther away the longer the telephoto you need you can save money by buying a slower lens f or so but that then gets you into exposure problems often forcing you to use very slow shutter speeds that result in a blurry image as to close up lenses and extension tubes those are not for sports they're for close up or macro photography they allow you to get nearer your subject so that you can get a larger image if you're interested in that too i'd prefer the extension tubes the problem with them is that you lose considerable light however in return you get crisp wonderful images close up lenses are cheaper but wil not get you a sharp image i hope that helps a little  Digital photography View camera Depth of field Photographic lens Contax Cinematography Shutter speed Leica Single-lens reflex camera Eyepiece Zoom lens Canon T90 Aperture Canon EF lens mount Pinhole camera Digital single-lens reflex cameras Reflecting telescope Konica Minolta Binoculars Canon FD Panoramic photography Film speed F-number Camera Schneider Kreuznach Lens (optics) Digital camera back Street photography Photographic film Aberration in optical systems Bokeh Canon EOS Computer Canon T70 Exposure (photography) Floppy disk Movie projector Charge-coupled device Fast bowling Apollo 8 History of telescopes Eye Time-lapse Film Nikon Corporation Panavision Twin-lens reflex camera Digital cinematography Stage lighting Solar power Technicolor Lighting Parallax Pornography IMAX Automatic number plate recognition Gas metal arc welding Joel and Ethan Coen Action potential Nikon FM2 Widescreen Anamorphic widescreen Car handling Black hole Confocal laser scanning microscopy Digital cinema Internal ballistics Paintball Zeiss Canon PowerShot G Diffraction CPU design Motion picture terminology Fresnel lens Advanced Photo System Dog agility Photograph Drag racing Light-emitting diode Autostereogram Microeconomics Canon EOS-300D Welding Image Amateur astronomy General relativity

what is the use of lens hood on slr camera a lens hood is used to prevent lens flare it prevents flare by blocking stray light that might come in from a side angle to the lens light that comes in that way can bounce off the inside of the lens housing and cause a reflection off the optics some lens hoods are petaled which means they have cuts in them that make them look like a flower this is done especially for a zoom or wide angle zoom lens to prevent the hood from blocking the optical angle at which the lens is capable otherwise too long of a lens hood without the petal shape and you'd get an image that had the hood in it at the edges  Photographic lens Leica Lens (optics) Contax Single-lens reflex camera Movie projector Digital photography Zoom lens Cinematography Reflecting telescope Nikon Corporation Digital single-lens reflex cameras Eye Konica Minolta Telescope Panoramic photography Anamorphic widescreen Four Thirds System Headlight Stage lighting Binoculars Digital camera Eyepiece Optical coating Cinerama Eyeglass prescription Depth of field IMAX Microscope Camera Optical telescope Vignetting Motion picture terminology Stereoscopy Zeiss Parallax Canon FD F-number Digital camera back Schneider Kreuznach Canon T90 Laser Rangefinder camera Red-eye effect Aperture Contact lens Mirror Fisheye lens Full frame digital SLR Glasses Camcorder Photography Railway signal Macro photography Bokeh Rainbow Amateur astronomy Twin-lens reflex camera Gravitational lens 3D computer graphics Autostereogram Angular resolution Ray tracing Sun Shutter speed Polarization Glass Nuclear weapon design Observational astronomy Canon EOS Joel and Ethan Coen Filter (optics) Lighting Pentax Widescreen Point and shoot camera Autofocus Automatic number plate recognition Sundial Drill bit Optics Laser engraving Knife Optical fiber Technicolor Tank Cosina Kenny McCormick Diffraction Video camera tube Bicycle lighting Hubble Space Telescope Light Gradient index optics DVD Laser diode Intraocular lens

how many megapixels i just got a polaroid caa s digital video camera it says mp stills but i can go into options and select resolution the options are m m and m is that megapixels or what if so does that mean it can take mp stills thanks those are settings that only take effect when you're shooting still images and yes those are megapixel settings not megabytes your camera has a megapixel sensor this is its native actual resolution the m option is interpolated fake meaning that the camera still captures the mp image but then digitally upsizes it internally so that it equals the dimensions that a mp pic would normally have same goes for the m setting except your images get downsized in the camera saves card space but the result would be virtually useless except for emailing pics to other people interpolation decreases image quality moreso when it's performed in camera such as yours than when doing it in a good image editing application for the best possible still image quality from this type of camera keep it at its native mp resolution hope that doesn't confuse you  Digital photography Digital camera Pixel Digital single-lens reflex cameras Digital video Motion capture Digital cinema Image file formats Video Stereoscopy Floppy disk Camcorder Anamorphic widescreen Nyquist___Shannon sampling theorem Medium format Digital image editing Mouse (computing) Camera phone Nintendo GameCube Bullet time High-definition television Image scanner Camera Konica Minolta Digital cinematography DV Computer graphics Leica NTSC Computer vision Surveillance Machine vision Raw image format IPod Hard disk Secure Digital card Digital Visual Interface Computer-generated imagery Windows Vista DVD Bluetooth Widescreen Instant camera 2D computer graphics Color temperature 3D computer graphics View camera Traditional animation Cinematography Movie projector RGB color model Aspect ratio (image) Game controller AmigaOS Shader Nikon D70 8 mm video format Adobe Photoshop IPAQ Patricia Ford Road-rule enforcement camera Holography Internet fraud Professional video camera Television Deinterlacing Digital camera back Gamut Oscilloscope Computer Movie camera PDP-11 E-mail Embedded system Digital-to-analog converter Panoramic photography Sound recording Tungsten Handheld Memory card PIC microcontroller Image processing Game Boy Screenshot Rendering (computer graphics) Moir__ pattern Xbox 360 Sensor Chroma subsampling Blue screen of death Warez Frame rate Computer wallpaper Virtual memory Photojournalism

photography question how do you take a picture where its completely black and only your face is lit heres an example http i tinypic com kyl w jpg i couldnt find the ones ive seen with a face so heres what i could find ive tried taking the picture in the dark but it just lights up the whole room the super simple answer is to use a light other than your cameras to light just what you want and take the picture with no flash if you have a point and shoot you might not be able to dis able your flash the pic you use for an example is lit from just bellow and to the right of the camera its obviously a defined light beam and not just a bare bulb  Photography Digital photography Macro photography Digital camera Film Panoramic photography Flash (photography) Lighting View camera Camera Prank flash Stereoscopy Single-lens reflex camera Charles Ives Leica Color temperature Bad Wolf Canon EOS Underwater photography Items in the Metroid series Point and shoot camera Photograph Game show Road-rule enforcement camera Canon T90 Cinematography Traditional animation The Mysterious Planet Spirit rover Konica Minolta Boom Town (Doctor Who) Traffic light Opportunity rover Gamma ray burst Photographic lens Henri Cartier-Bresson Technicolor Speed of light Lightsaber Metroid Prime 2: Echoes Headlight Depth of field Bicycle lighting Motion picture terminology Contax Light gun Diffraction Computer animation Goatse.cx Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure Nikon FM2 Tokusatsu Fluorescent lamp Charge-coupled device Instant camera Street photography Filmmaking Anamorphic widescreen Color Pinhole camera Deep Impact (space mission) Gamut Stage lighting Shutter speed Bubble Bobble Bob and George Mega Man VII Xenon flash lamp Bullet time Star Destroyer Infrared Identity Crisis (comics) Timeline of invention Photographic film Samus Aran Light-emitting diode Spirit rover timeline for 2005 March Patricia Ford Game Boy Black hole Panavision Max Payne Ray tracing Cinerama PIC microcontroller Super Metroid Resident Evil: Apocalypse Gamma camera DNA Computer and video game genres Camcorder STS-62 Link (Legend of Zelda) School bus Cinematographer Video camera tube Photojournalism Surveillance Punisher Light

i heard there are important lights in studio lighting key light fill light and background light question i heard the fill light is less bright than key light pls teach me how many watts the for each to make a good photo result in studio i'm planning of using black color background thanks a lot folks depending on the type of results you are looking for you may vary the ratio of the key and fill lights however or power ratios would be a good place to start for basic studio photography will give you a one f stop difference is a stop difference the greater the difference between the two the more dramatic the shadows will be if you want a really black background then you will need to be careful to ensure that your lights don't spill onto the background a colored background can be black in the studio if you don't allow any light to hit it but a black background will look gray if you aren't careful with your key and fill snoots barn doors or grids are light modifiers used to control the spread and spill of your lighting i'd encourage you to play with just one light to start and learn how changing its position will alter the highlights and shadows on your model don't get too complicated in the lighting too quickly or you will find yourself flailing with the lights and not really seeing what each one is doing once you really get a handle on what the one key light does then consider adding fill background accent hair etc one at a time here's an example taken with one light carefully controlled to not hit the background http www evanbaines com gallery portrait php  Drawing Photography Solar cell Color Stereoscopy Digital photography E85 Transformer Japanese tea ceremony Polarization Mach kernel Diamond cut Lighting Internal ballistics Dragon Booster Jumpstart 3rd Grade Bicycle lighting Milton H.

advice on erasing unwanted objects w photoshop elements i removed two people and really want some pointers because after i remove with clone stamp some of the places look unnatural before http i photobucket com albums y wendy picture jpg after http i photobucket com albums y wendy picture jpg oh yeah what laws are there about human subjects like those of people you don't know that you accidentally photograph do they have to sign releases or something like that can they sue if the photo ends up online like say webshots good shot of the owl either way you seem to have cloned the area of cactus in the background with a bit too much duplication it's not bad but could use a little more variety zoom in on that part of the picture and work in a few more different cactus features from the right to do this you need to restart your clone at several different spots try to place cloned objects at different levels vertically then the original as for legalities i am not a legal expert but i believe you're not really in trouble unless you are making money from the photo but obviously it's not a good idea to post recognizable images of people without their permission with a shot like this the people are a bit distant and blurred so there shouldn't be a problem it does improve this image to unclutter the background though  JPEG Goatse.cx Digital photography Stereoscopy Google HyperCard Spyware Theory of conduct Drill bit Oasis (band) Nintendo Entertainment System Windows Vista Depth of field Drawing Visual Basic Expanded Universe (Star Wars) PlayStation 2 Road-rule enforcement camera Suede (band) Surveillance MAME BitTorrent Minesweeper (computer game) PNG Human cloning ASCII art Ol' Dirty Bastard Late Night with Conan O'Brien Adobe Photoshop Star Wars: Battlefront II Public domain Warez Independent Media Center The Beach Boys First-person shooter IPod Contract Internet phenomenon View camera The Strokes Cloning Bon Jovi Leica Eyeglass prescription Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Super Mario Bros.

where can i find tips so use my new camera helloo there i jus got a sony cybershot dsc h i love it i don't know very well how to use this camera i was wondering why it takes the pictures with noise how can i reduce the noise when i take my pictures sometimes i try to use flash and it says flash settings cannot be changed do i have to change setting when i take the pictures in my house they are darker or they look blue how can i change settings so it can take my pictures better thanks for reading have a wonderful day mel you don't need tips on the camera everything you need to know about the camera is in teh manual you need to learn and understand the basics of photography exposure how the next three things work together to make a picture aperture depth of field focus plains shutter speed freeze or blur action iso film or sensor speed white balance color temperature and the light casts they can give you can be a good or bad thing depending noise issue probably set to auto iso the smaller the iso number the cleaner the image will look but it needs to work with slower shutter speeds and larger apertures to get a proper exposure in auto mode the camera will try and take an average shot also point and shoot cameras have ver ysmall sensors and are not great at high iso or in low light if you want good performance in that arena you'll need to step up into a dslr flash cannot be changed again probably an auto mode issue the camera is determining what it needs to make a proper exposure for what it thinks the subject is supposed to be darker shots indoors and blue color cast there is not a lot of light indoors for the camera your eyes have a better ability to compensate for low light than film or a digital sensor given the specs of the camera it can only do so much the blue color cast if probably because either the white balance is set incorrectly or the wb sensor is being fooled and auto selecting the wrong wb for you  Photography Single-lens reflex camera Digital camera Stereoscopy Digital single-lens reflex cameras Aperture View camera Cinematography Exposure (photography) Canon T90 Camera Depth of field Film speed Canon EOS F-number Leica Street photography Photographic film Floppy disk Panoramic photography Color temperature Konica Minolta Point and shoot camera Shutter (photography) Movie projector Macro photography Automatic number plate recognition Canon PowerShot G Enlarger Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Eye Explosive material Mouse (computing) Sensor Widescreen M16 (rifle) Nikon Corporation Galileo spacecraft Pixel Time-lapse Light-emitting diode Raw image format Gamut Canon T70 Welding Universal Serial Bus Anamorphic widescreen PlayStation Portable Digital cinema Lighting Quake III Arena Motion capture Persistence of vision Amateur astronomy Digital camera back Digital image editing STS-62 Digital cinematography ISO 9000 Nikon FM2 Electrophysiology Volleyball Contax Technicolor Photographic lens Shutter angle Motion picture terminology Hard disk Panavision DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Nikon FA Zone system Color Transformer DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution DVD Tank Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Nikon FE2 CPU cache Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Drill bit Oscilloscope Dance Dance Revolution Spark plug Autostereogram

are there any books on the psychology of directing and the psychology of cinematography what i'm after is not not the what to do of directing actors and choosing shots angles and lenses but the how and the why any damn fool can make a film but to make a quality film youre gonna have to understand why certain shots affect the mood of the viewer in certain ways wheras other shots will be ok but nowhere near as powerful the how you can learn by trial and error but the why is something you can learn quicker from the writings of master film makers take a look at the books written discussing the very successful propaganda films that came out of germany leading up to and during wwii you may be able to find some academic works on some of our department of state propaganda films made during the cold war denis sanders got an academy award for czechoslovakia which was sponsored by the department of state most recently but i doubt you will find any critical works on him yet the dennis miller has produced some amazing propaganda films which may rival the ones produced during the second world war by leni riefenstahl  Leni Riefenstahl Cinematography Propaganda Film Casablanca (film) Cinema of Germany Film noir Documentary film Academy Award Propaganda film Mark Romanek Robert Altman Joel and Ethan Coen Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope Films that have been considered the greatest ever Machinima World War II Digital cinematography Psychology Film director Martin Scorsese Universum Film AG Citizen Kane Charles Peirce David Irving Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Propaganda model The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film) Apocalypse Now Akira Kurosawa Plato Cold War Information warfare War film Emmy Award Dziga Vertov Why We Fight The Battle of Algiers Academy Award for Best Cinematography BBC television drama Communist Party of Czechoslovakia Clinical depression Noam Chomsky Holocaust denial Gulf War Oklahoma State University - Stillwater Frank Herbert Extreme Programming Albert Speer Digital photography Gladiator (2000 film) History of film The Godfather Fahrenheit 9/11 Philosophy of language Mythology Second language acquisition IMAX Ingmar Bergman Contax Cinema of China Creation-evolution controversy Social psychology Nuremberg Summer Olympic Games Dr. No Olympia (film) Banned films James Wong Howe National Film Board of Canada Self-concept Cinema of Sweden Network (film) Deconstruction Academia View camera Paradise Lost War of the Worlds (2005 film) William L.

i have two photos that have stuck to the glass of the frame and now the glass is broken how can i remove the glass without damaging the picture i've considered taking it to a professional but who a framer a photographer but thought i'd explore y a's community answer board first actually it was given to me to do by my stepdaughter who thinks i can do all things i hate to disappoint her this is a relatively common problem and there are a couple of ways that you can resolve this situation depending upon the type of print we are dealing with however if this is a unique photo for which you have no negative or file take the image to a professional who the best place to go is a preservationist at a local historical society or library larger libraries may have on their staff a archivalist preservationist who can evaluate your image and suggest the best method to fix the print i can tell you that one of the most common ways to fix the problem especially if the image is a fiber based black and white print is to immerse the photo in cold distilled water with some kodak photo flo which you can purchase at a darkroom supply store however this isn't going to be the best solution for all images especially if this is an ink jet print in fact that would be a horrible suggestion as it would destroy theprint the other method is to place the photo inside a sealed box and gradually increase the humidity inside the box until the image releases from the glass this is typically going to be the safest method but you do have to watch out about heat too much heat and the emulsion can sepparate from the paper or at the bare minimum cause some bubbling anyhow if you have no clue what kind of image this is then get an evaluation and then proceed from there also in the future i would suggest that you dont use the direct mount flush to the glass but instead use a buffer such as a archival paper matte http www lightimpressionsdirect com servlet onlineshopping  Digital photography Photography Solar power Poker jargon Inkjet printer Photographic film CPU cache Software testing Printed circuit board Computer printer Stereoscopy Lighting Photographic paper View camera Konica Minolta Floppy disk Extreme Programming Microeconomics Light-emitting diode Circuit design Water Enlarger Enterprise content management Camera Philosophy of space and time Panoramic photography Inflation Movie projector Medical prescription Cross site scripting Intelligent design Prostate cancer PNG Computer virus Technicolor Tea C programming language Hubble Space Telescope JavaServer Pages World Wide Web Solar cell Cold fusion Roswell UFO incident AmigaOS Film preservation Alexander Technique Drawing Warez Windows Vista Trademark Action potential Macro photography Alcohol fuel Carbon dioxide Linked list Nuclear power Theodicy Gramophone record Drill bit C-41 process Opportunity rover Expert system Principal-agent problem Brewery Rendering (computer graphics) Objective-C Common Unix Printing System Ethics PaX Physical paradox Naval mine Energy development Renewable energy Printing press IMAX Electrophysiology Heinkel He 112 Baseball Crossword Hydroponics Collodion process Color Computer Theory of conduct Pretty Good Privacy Edward S.

this probably should be posted else where but wedding photos might know i have a signed contract with a bride to photograph her wedding my contract charged her with her giving down and agreeing to pay the balance days before the wedding date we thought we had a rapport with the bride and groom having done the engagement session as well as the bridal session and tons of phone and email conversations then when the balance was due the bride called with a sob story about how things got out of hand and they weren't even going to be able to pay their utilities in that month yada yada i told her i could extend the payments for two months and asked her to give me a schedule to expect payment by she promised no less than on and the balance in two remaining payment over weeks we showed for the wedding and were the professionals we are until the end when they were leaving we walked outside and what to they have reserved to leave the reception in a stretch hummer that alone is that made us pretty mad but we got over it until the nd when we didn't not receive the i emailed the bride and nicely inquired if she had forgotten her payment along with our agreement now on the th she still has not responded to my letter since this has never happened in years of wedding photography my question is this if she just ignores us and does not pay but say in two years sends the balance am i beholden to give her the proof cd and wedding album i know i can take her to court and at this point i might but if i have to go that route i am just wondering what i am responsible for is she continues to ignore any other photogs ever in this position any ideas i am sending a letter return receipt requested demanding payment but i'm wondering how long i am to be held to the contract when she is in breach of our contract is it null and void when she did not uphold her end of signed contract mrsdouble you are so right about the emotions of our business my problem now is that i am mad i don't have a specific date in my contract if they do not meet it i just don't want to have to give her the proofs in a year or so if all of a sudden she decided to pay i haven't decided on court yet going to try a scary letter first thanks antoni but i'm thinking i might make people mad i don't really care if i upset the couple but weddings are about percent of my bread and butter word of mouth brings many brides to me and i would hate for word of mouth to keep them away i plan on getting my money or she will get no images i proof on cd and she won't even get that much less her album what i need to know is since she has voided her contract do i have to honor the huge wedding discount in the contract for lose pics and is there a time limit on how long i have to keep her images if she pays balance in years do i have to give her proofs or can i her for storage ok diva hope this helps a bit i always charge a deposit and dont hand anything over image wise till i have the money c o d but then i do only or a year debt collecting done this twice and it works real fast fax to one of them at their place of work in big letters there name how much is owed when you want it now this is the nasty bit print the page times tape them together feed the first page in dial the number when the first page comes out the otherside of fax tape the first page to the last page that is what i call a revolving fax it just keeps going till they stop at the other end or run out of paper and it will keep redialing them for you put your fax on redial so everytime they stop it it starts again so they turn the fax off of run out of paper thats great when they put more paper in it or turn it back on it just starts printing the fax again over and over and over and over annoying eh its like the fax of terror but it works you tell them the fax stops when the cash is in your hand they will rush to the bank then to you guys how far you take this is up to you i found hours and about yards of fax at the persons office in the morning and all work mates read it of course and they are ringing begging me to stop i say sure warm the palm of my hand with what you owe me and i shall stop the fax its extreme i know but its your money embarrass them fax their work and dont stop till you feel the cash two ways you can do this you can bomb the fax overnite so they arrive to a beeping empty fax and the longest fax they will ever get they reload the fax and the memory prints your demand again over and over again the other way is hourly fax their work with the demand final idea i havent done would be put their pic in your shop and detail they havent paid you you know do you know these people thet are bad debtors believe me you do the fax they will pay weither your angry enough we will see a

what are some interesting ideas to write a book on i really want to write a nonfictional book that includes lots of photography because i'm just as interested in photography as i am in writing i couldn't think of anything that really strikes my interest and i want to use the opportunity i have to drive cross country to include in my book as well any ideas hi as you plan to write non fictional book the experiences you encounter on your road trip will be a good topic to cover as they'll be from your point of view i'm assuming most of the topics would have been covered by most authors and if there's a unique topic to write on i wonder if someone will share but if they do that'll be awesome so i believe what you feel about the country the places you visit and the people you meet will make it an interesting read the life behind the picture will be more interesting than just the picture your experience in a smaller town compared to a bigger similarities dis similarities between towns what do they enjoy how do they enjoy celebrations unique events their role models heroes uniqueness of a place s and ofcourse how you see and how you would describe a place there'll be enough information material to collect in the end you'll have to choose what may interest the readers it's your experience that you would like to share with others  Photography Computer Frank Herbert Jacob Neusner Non-fiction Surveillance Digital photography Homeschooling The Chronicles of Narnia Robert A.

method of putting images on sugar paper a little more info would help what kind of image sugar paper is too absorbent to print on directly you could try printing the image on to epson or other transfer paper and ironing it on to the sugar paper transfer paper is intended to use on fabrics but sugar paper is quite soft and fibrous so it should work you could try printing a lazer trans sheet put the sugar paper on a bit of polythene you then wet the lazer trans sheet until the image loosens and slide it on to your sugar paper wet sugar paper is very weak so wait very patiently for it to dry for a simple design trace the image put carbon paper between the tracing paper and sugar paper and retrace the image pressing quite strongly or on the reverse of the tracing paper trace the design using a soft dark pencil or white chalk pencil if the sugar paper is dark put the tracing paper right way up on the sugar paper and trace the design again pressing quite heavily this will tranfer the pencil on the back on to the sugar paper you can go over it with a marker to strengthen the outline you could blu tack the paper to a wall project the image on to it and draw round it you could try dylon image maker but the sugar paper may break when it gets wet or when you rub away the backing paper  Etching Drawing Drill bit Printmaking Paper Typewriter Photography Textile manufacturing Casting Sugar beet Seismic retrofit Inkjet printer Violin Shroud of Turin Control character Toilet paper Upholstery Plaster Offset printing Glass Coffee Kimberly-Clark Corporation Laser engraving Tofu View camera Mattress X-ray Adrian Frutiger Pencil Camera Tire Bookbinding Hamster Tag Sugar Enlarger Bread Ray tracing Ham Enterprise content management Sugarcane Harmonica Hemp Sailing Breastfeeding Champagne (beverage) Carbon dioxide Brewery Diving suit Urinary incontinence CPU cache Photographic film Towel Oscilloscope Bicycle brake systems Common bean Printing press Tattoo Graphite Fire extinguisher Geographic information system Wood Internal ballistics Cannabis cultivation Menstrual cup One-time pad Titanium Opportunity rover Flax First aid Desk Biochemistry CMYK color model Rendering (computer graphics) Acetic acid Mango M.C.

photograph that's creased ive got a large photograph thats very special to me unfortuneatly its been ouy of a frame for a few years ang got creased question how can i get rid of the creases without marking the print i cant get another copy simply because this pic has been autographed by my favourate singer sugestions this is not what you want to hear but your original is damaged in a way that is likely to render it unrepairable you can scan it or have this done and the crease can be removed with photoshop or similar program then you can display your copy knowing that you actually do have the original which is put away for safe keeping otherwise you might seek the services of a professional photo restorer and then put the picture back in a frame warts and all knowing that that's the best that could be done  Digital photography Photography Hockey rink Laws of cricket PNG Stereoscopy Technicolor Anamorphic widescreen Patricia Ford Screenshot GIF Biblical inerrancy Traditional animation Trademark Ebook Cricket pitch Goatse.cx Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Book of Kells Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Enterprise content management The Star Wars Holiday Special Photographic film Sneakers (film) Cathode ray tube Cricket EIA-708 Roswell UFO incident Panoramic photography Computer virus Secret Gospel of Mark Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 IPod Game programmer Yearbook Spyware MAC address Pornography Photojournalism Run out Cinerama Graphics Photograph View camera Singlish STS-114 C__line Dion Insurance Fine art photography Counterfeit Adobe Photoshop Windows Vista Cinematography GNU General Public License Digital video Amiga Power Autograph Shroud of Turin Partnership (cricket) Film preservation Virginian Railway Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Macintosh Finder Image scanner 2D computer graphics Plame affair Sponsorship scandal Bob and George Fair use Killian documents Gmail Nude celebrities on the Internet BASIC programming language Warez Starfleet ranks and insignia ZX Spectrum Super Mario Bros. 3 PostScript Fast bowling Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Digital art The Star-Spangled Banner Floppy disk Dismissal (cricket) Digital camera back Down syndrome Weekly newspaper Windows 2000 G-Man (Half-Life) Screenplay Hat Drawing Three card monte Machinima Copy protection Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Lionel Corporation

what is the best flash for a nikon d i will be shooting for a magazine and need a flash what is the best to purchase i'd vote for the sb for the power and flexibility you would make out better with more than one flash and in the future the sb works very well with multiple light sources more output would be helpful since i'm guessing you will only have one light source with more light you can bounce the light off the wall or ceiling or use a diffuser so you don't have such a harsh look to your shots if the flash is not powerful enough you won't have enough light to do this adequately the sb kicks pretty good but the sb puts out about more light there are other features that will matter in the future but for your first job where you will only have one flash i think this is the most important consideration  Counter-Strike Digital photography Bicycle lighting Flash (comics) Macromedia Flash Canon EOS Items in the Metroid series Table tennis Solar cell Konica Minolta Canon T90 Sonic the Hedgehog Phoebe Halliwell Tennis B-47 Stratojet GunZ The Duel Internal ballistics M16 (rifle) Lighting Bubble Bobble Shader Carbine Racquetball Single-lens reflex camera Password Wind power Game show Light-emitting diode Hybrid vehicle GunBound Red-eye effect Bomberman Game Boy The Bill Robot Master Incandescent light bulb Technology in the Stargate universe Super Metroid Theory of conduct Stage lighting Economic inequality Pinball $ale of the Century View camera Nikon FA Sega Saturn Kardashev scale Nikon FM2 Mario Field-programmable gate array Badminton Snooker Liquid crystal display Nikon FE Transformer Roy Jones Jr. Nikon FE2 Solar power Wayne Corporation Milton H.

which college for photography i want to know what college has a good reputation for their photography classes any college recommendations will be fine but if someone could tell me one that is in virginia i would appreciate it given that you are asking this question i am going to assume you are starting out with taking college level photography classes and that you are limited on your budget as well the suggestion here is to look towards your local community or jr college and their art department they will have digital imaging classes digital photography classes darkroom techniques etc all geared towards a progression to an associates degree in graphic arts which is the category of the degree i've attended personally the digital imaging website design and yes digital photography classes at my local community college fl and have found them to be fun creative and a joy to take and although you have to do a lot of work in the course and i had to submit a portfolio of selections plus we did work with the adobe professional creative suite of software products it was something i enjoyed tremendously i found my local newspaper was a great source of ideas on events local nearby that were either free or low cost so that all my submitted works were of different origins and all it meant was that my time was required to satify the course syllabus i now have that portfolio and i enjoy using my digital slr cameras and their lenses even more so than the mm slrs that were the only option when i was a young adult yes i am an empty nesting single retiree going back to college i've used this knowledge to build skills i never thought i had and for me arts is a long stretch from the sciences that i based my original ugrad and grad degrees as well as my careers on and have used the skills in designing websites for the family farm as well as others and marketing our products  Digital photography Konica Minolta Adobe Photoshop Single-lens reflex camera Art Leica Canon EOS Digital camera Graduate school Community college Stereoscopy Product Lifecycle Management Nikon Corporation Education in the United States Contax GED Digital single-lens reflex cameras Panoramic photography Savannah College of Art and Design Digital art Computer Education in the People's Republic of China Emerson College Photojournalism Carnegie Mellon University Intellectual property Ebook Graphic design Canon T90 Digital audio workstation Rangefinder camera Traditional animation Strategic management View camera Open access Education in Japan Advanced Placement Program Film Trademark Cinematography Education Academia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Advertising College admissions Software engineering High-definition television Windows Vista Homeschooling Master's degree Secure Digital card Camera Parachuting IPod Advanced Photo System University of Massachusetts Amherst Scalable Vector Graphics Macro photography Game programmer Medium format Yearbook Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Digital video 2D computer graphics Extreme Programming Camcorder Cooper Union Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Motion picture rating system Bloodstain pattern analysis Bluetooth Massachusetts Institute of Technology Digital rights management 3D computer graphics Fair use California Polytechnic State University Enterprise content management Scientific method College IBM PC compatible Photographic lens Software testing Education in Australia Henri Cartier-Bresson Full frame digital SLR Scientology beliefs and practices Wi-Fi X Window System Princeton University DeviantART Copyright Karl Marx

how do i get the white balance right i recently went on a trip to london england as part of the st world scout jamboree i took with me my or my dad's as the case may be canon eos d i have gotten into photography over the last two years but this summer have just started concentrating on it as a hobby this summer i have adobe photoshop lightroom and while on the trip i took many photos in the canon raw format however once i have all my raw photos loaded into lightroom and i've messed around with giving them a warmer look or a blueish tint i've realize on many of them they both look good so my question is how do you determine which one is best for certain pictures i really don't want to end up with two duplicates of every pictures i have thanks as far as i can tell there is no dropper tool in lightroom and while i am not more than photoshop cs literate when i open photoshop from lightroom it doesn't open up into camera raw due to the fact that lightroom converts the pictures to tiff and not totally sure how to change white balance from there ok so i've checked up on my camera's manual but just wondering will any piece of white paper work or do i need to go to a photography store and by some special white paper and what do you use a grey card for since you setting the white balance and do you set your white balance every time you start a new series of shots dangit ok there is a dropper in lightroom but i've just been using printer paper in the last five minutes for a manual white balance and i'll tell you wow i know my room is a difficult photo spot due to the mixture of lights halogen flourescent and incadescent natural but man wow that gives me a good shot i too have a canon d and use it daily in my business i shoot raw its beats the hell out of jpg i know when you test a photo there is a range that it looks good in but in photoshop cs which im sure is pretty much the same as lightroom in the raw conversion there is a white dropper looks like a little pipette use this and click on a white portion of your image you can also jack the saturation up to and adjust the white balance and hue until it looks somewhat normal and then bring the sat back down to or ive used that trick when there isnt any white its a nice little trick ideally you should have a white grey black card with you when you shoot and then adjust for that image and the rest should be perfect all this said it wont make any difference unless you monitor is calibrated you can do this by hand or with a item called a spyder there are others on the market but i use the spyder from colorvision good luck  Digital photography Adobe Photoshop Photography Konica Minolta Screenshot Color Digital camera PNG Color theory Photograph Film IPod PlayStation Portable Technicolor Gamut Photographic film Pixel Windows XP NTSC Canon EOS Lighting Transformer Oscilloscope Extreme Programming Carburetor Goatse.cx Macro photography Gramophone record GIMP View camera Opportunity rover Shaggy dog story CPU cache E85 Screenplay Digital image editing Trademark Color temperature Textile manufacturing Explosive material Color blindness IPhoto JPEG ImageMagick RGB color model Canon PowerShot G Embedded system Drill bit HSL color space Single-lens reflex camera Common Unix Printing System Compiler optimization Amateur astronomy Poker jargon Traditional animation Street photography Cinematography Handloading Contract bridge Jumpstart 3rd Grade Apollo 8 Camcorder Snooker Panoramic photography Bob and George Timpani B-47 Stratojet Fischer Random Chess The Price Is Right Color management Digital single-lens reflex cameras Floppy disk Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Diamond Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Supply and demand GunBound Professional wrestling attacks Camera Kasparov versus The World Ethernet Glass Japanese tea ceremony Internet fraud Leica Mouse (computing) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Ozone depletion

for all photogs at the bequest of antoni everyone has a favorite shot not just because it turned out great but because it took an inordinate amount of work to get or maybe it was just plain luck irregardless it sticks out in your mind how did you get your favorite shot luck skill tenacity you know i'm not sure i have a favorite shot looking back over my adult life i've been shooting seriously for almost years my volume can't match yours but there are thousands of shots to consider also i virtually always took pictures because i wanted to and not because i was sent on an assignment even at family functions if i wasn't in the mood i just left my camera home i am sure that for most of you it will be different when you do this all day every day for a living your whole approach is different from mine trust me i can relate this to my practice of dentistry more than you know all three factors come into play there in ways that would be too boring to discuss you win some you lose some well if i lose one i get the chance to improve it by doing it over haha asking what my favorite shot is would be about the same as asking what my favorite song is ask me today and i'll readily give you an answer but in the same breath i will name or close contenders ask me tomorrow and you'll get or different songs there are some that come to mind though and land on the short list of my personal favorites you know what i'd say that all three factors were important in each one first you have to have some degree of luck to happen upon a scene that is worth photographing one of my favorites that has been catagorized as a topten shot is a brilliant sunset i forget the year right off but it was about i was driving out to my girlfriend's house which was about miles from home i don't remember what we had planned but i told her that i had to go back home to get my camera so i could take a picture of the sunset if i had left home minutes earlier i would not have seen the sunset developing the way it was if i had left home minutes later i would have missed the whole show secondly having some degree of skill really increases the odds that the shot of a lifetime will translate the way you wanted it to i thought of that sunset shot first so i'll act as if it's my favorite as always i was loaded with transparency film probably consumer grade ektachrome i had not discovered epr yet still a stop or two will make or break an image i never used filters other than occasionally using a polarizer so this is the scene as it presented i admit that this one is pretty easy to meter but let's say there was at least some skill involved most of my other favorite shots can be described similarly i had to be lucky to arrive on the scene when i did and i had to have my photographer's eye since this is for antoni with me or i would not have had the skill to convert what i saw into a picture in the first place knowing what can be accomplished makes you view a scene or subject through skilled eyes in a way that a lack of skill would not allow tenacity is rarely a factor for me as i don't do this for a living if i don't get what i want i move on this was especially true in my pre digital days if i was shooting penny a shot plus x i could go out the next day and try again but there was usually a week or so lag between the time i took a picture and the time i saw the result on film there just wasn't opportunity to go back and fix it in the studio or on assignment you guys might be forced to stick to it until you get it right it's a far far cry from that but my recent series on the crystal pitcher makes me appreciate that i have at least one more in the series waiting for a time when i can set things up differently so i can do it again it has now gone somewhat beyond the original intent of making a picture that was okay for ebay i've got to get ready for the real world work so i will end for now maybe that will be it for my discourse and maybe not since i spoke about one shot let me show you a small scan of the print that was made from the slide well over years ago it has held up pretty well i did not go over the scan at all for dust etc so i will down rez to dpi when i get the time i will replace this with a larger version if you are curious about the unadulterated sunset go to http www flickr com photos samfeinstein and check it out part of the luck in this shot is the small light on the horizon it is just a regular street light i could clone this catch light out but i kind of like it better with the light there  Digital photography Photography Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Time Out of Mind Milton H.

should i apply for news photog job my local paper small town circulation est area population est is advertising for a weekend photographer yes i work during the week but i wonder if anyone has any thoughts on what it would be like to be a weekend warrior the ad stipulates that knowledge of digital photography is mandatory but i think i've got that knocked at least to the level required for their publication i've already been published in the paper enough times that i've lost count so i know how to edit and submit to their standards i imagine the job would involve covering some local sports no professional teams festivals and events and the occasional fire or accident just based on what i see running already the geopgraphic area would not have me on the road at all as their circulation area could be circumscribed within a cirlce of about a mile radius you know the demands of the job so talk to me sidebar i admit that part of the attraction is that there is a brand new race track auto under construction miles from home it will be for scca and club events for a few years but i am picturing how nice that press pass would be at times i've worked as a musician in a party band weddings etc and i know what it's like to see people out there who are not expecting to see their dentist in an alternate role i also know what it's like to work with the public when they treat you like a servant instead of the educated person that you are just in case you want to warn me about those aspects of this idea of course my wife would play a major role in my decision is it accepted practice to have an assistant accompany a photographer on jobs with restricted access like a race for instance or is that pushing it too far antoni i don't have a portfolio as such but as i say i've submitted photos before for publication some were novelty shots and some were just newsworthy events where i noticed they were not able to send a photographer i never asked for money but just sent to shot in as a favor i know the publisher formally anyhow and the editor personally and a few of their current photographers if they insist on a degree in photography or a portfolio that's the end of the road for me i know the lack of prior experience of some of their photographers so that would not be a problem if they want a portfolio i'll send them to my flickr site or refer them to my previously published shots haha pali i am not worried about becoming well known as i said this is a small town where i was born and i have lived for years i have a degree of notoriety in town already due to appearing as a musician in a local band in a recently departed life serving on local boards and committees etc my plus would be that i actually already know most of the people i would be photographing and wouldn't have to ask how to spell their name poppa since my kids are grown and out family time is less of a concern but i appreciate your thoughts i do still have my wife to consider and that's the main reason i mentioned taking her with me we can hit the events and run an assignment would be a good excuse to check things out and another assignment would be a good excuse to leave early if the event was not so hot antoni i did a couple of weddings years and years ago as a gift to the bride and groom who could not afford a proper photographer any more than i could afford a proper gift i found that i ended up practically serving as the wedding planner as nobody had a clue what to do next i walked them through the obligatory stages of a reception under the guise of setting up the next picture photographer and wedding organizer i'm building quite a resume for my job app already well i talked to my friend the editor about this position and he said forget it you would be a piece of meat that certainly is not my intention as i would do it only for fun as d put it a weekend fling i have no intention of leaving my career and i also don't want to ruin my love of photography so i have decided to let this opportunity pass on to someone else i appreciate everyone's input and i will give the points to d for adding the perspective that i ought to leave this opening as a way for a younger person who wants a career in photography to get their foot in the door i had not considered that i might be depriving someone of their new career i notice that you are a dentist if i read all your material correctly i am wondering why you might be considering taking a weekend photography for your small town newspaper if you are thinking of making a career change i can understand it but if this is just a weekend fling for you you are not going to like this answer there are many young people out there who would love to start a career in photography and a small town newspaper is a good place to start this kind of a job does not require college or experience only a talent for making a good photograph when needed if you are not considering a career change my opinion is that you will leave this job to be filled by a talented young starting photographer and stick to your own stable and relatively well paying profession i have owned a relatively successful commercial photography studio in the cleveland ohio area for over years it is a difficult profession to start out in if you do not want to make it your profession don't deprive someone who wants to devote their life to photography out of a job opportunity just because you feel that a weekend part time job would be an ego trip  Plame affair Education in the People's Republic of China Avenue Q

come on you pros im using dr sams idea you know imitation is so we come here for something dont we there are pro forums we like also right why do i ask questions i already know the answer to or theres no really answer here to get some quality info out of the other people who know the answer also the how do i make one colour the rest black and white are ok for some but theres so many talented people here p ace karl kevin ryan diva ben evan if your not listed its just theres so many here i respect cant list you all they are wasted looking for quality questions so go on ask a question i know you know the answer but why not bounce some things around for the benefit of all go on spent five points please comments a often when i am in a professional lecture teeth not photography i will ask a question that i know the answer to just so the lecturer will not miss something that i think is important to bring out yeah i wait until he is wrapping up that particular topic but if he omitted some important information i like to ask so he can answer instead of raising my hand and saying didn't you forget to say of course if we are going to do this effectively we will have to remember to come back to certain questions a few times most likely to do this easily you can roll over the plus sign under the original question and then click on add to my personal watch list then when you log on go to your watch list under your profile and see what has been added to the discussion i think we will all find that doing this takes enough time that we will tend to not even look at those basic questions about whether someone is pretty or how to add color to a picture so we won't be annoyed by them any longer  Photography Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Los Angeles Kings CPU cache Internet troll Whose Line Is It Anyway?

do you like this idea no it's not another picture what started out as a simple photo in support of an answer turned into a rather interesting discussion http answers yahoo com question index ylt andtsiyhkuezpxaqlpqcnrdsy ix qid aaxpxhf is that something we might continue here community guidelines say don't use yahoo answers as a soapbox to vent your frustrations rant or otherwise violate the question and answer format if you prefer to have discussions or chat with others please use one of yahoo 's other community services such as yahoo groups so i'm not sure how well they would receive this kind of activity i mean technically this would be a discussion and a forum might be better would you like to share photos for critique and pointers or is that too much like work for those of you who do this for a living i know how that can be and that's why i am over here so much and rarely visit the dental section any more but what do you think yes antoni i am noticing that the section is settling out in strata with like minds seeking their own level it might be nice to serve as a resource to newbies but yahoo isn't paying anyone a dime to run this service for them so i say that we can turn it to our own benefit i am sure that there are existing forums probably hundreds of them on the internet that cater to exactly this sort of thing but in a way it would be amusing to hold these discussions right out here in public view and see what kind of response someone who doesn't have a clue ha often that's me might have to say i hardly feel any guilt at all when i don't tell someone how to put just one color in a black and white photo antoni one of my recent replies to a request for critique was to say my mother taught me that if i can't say something nice about someone don't say anything at all there were already or answers above me that laid it out and said that the snapshots pretty much sucked so i wasn't being cruel i thought about deleting my answer after the fact but for some reason i didn't i mean i think i know enough to have an appreciation for what i don't know but you can't start at the very beginning with everyone who asks if their picture is any good if i think someone has a good eye but needs to improve their technical skills i used to tell them so but from now on i think i will refer them to you for your judgement on that topic i like the idea critiqueing could work if it was 'here is what i tried to convey ' or it was something like a lighting problem all accompanied by an image or images s keep it to an ask answer format it wouldn't be work for me the images i take to earn a living are different than those i do for myself those are the ones that i would be interested in it would be a change from teen somethings who can't formulate a question can't write it and sorry almost started ranting nothing ventured i'm up for it vance  Theory of conduct Extreme Programming Internet troll Have I Got News For You Microeconomics Philosophy of language Milton H.

how do you take pictures of moving things sceneries without the pictures turning out blurry can you do that with a canon eos camera usa a faster shutter speed you can do this a couple of different ways but the easiest is to shoot in shutter priority mode on your canon eos camera represented by a tv on the mode dial this will enable you to choose a shutter speed fast enough to freeze motion about or faster depending on the situation read your user manual to learn how to adjust the shutter speed in that mode and the camera will set everything else automatically  Canon T90 Canon EOS Leica Shutter speed Automatic number plate recognition Canon PowerShot G Photography Movie projector Digital photography Canon T70 Time-lapse Konica Minolta Rangefinder camera Camera Modem Canon EF lens mount Mouse (computing) Canon FD Shutter (photography) F-number Horse gait Nikon FM2 Nikon FA GunZ The Duel Ethernet View camera Autofocus Stage lighting Exposure (photography) Shutter angle Nikon FE Macro photography Redundant array of independent disks Depth of field Hard disk Aperture Bullet time S Wind turbine Street photography Persistence of vision Film speed Bubble Bobble CPU design Cinematography Gradius Canon EOS-20D BZFlag Windows XP Camcorder Manual transmission Speed limit Film Burroughs B5000 Nikon FE2 Screenshot Cheating in Counter-Strike Super Mario 64 Oscilloscope PlayStation Portable Quake III Arena Motion blur RISC Diablo II: Lord of Destruction IBM PC compatible M16 (rifle) Knight Rider Compiler optimization Motorola 68000 Fast bowling Pixel Carburetor Charge-coupled device Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME GunBound Amateur astronomy Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Drag racing Digital circuit VHS Embedded system Beatmania IIDX Secure Digital card Panoramic photography Team Fortress Classic Personal rapid transit Dance Dance Revolution Canon EOS-300D Photographic lens Traffic light Cangjie method Enlarger MOS Technology 6502 Computer Pump It Up Digital cinema

is it ok if i used or create an artist name for my photography you see i'm a photographer well a student one and i'm thinkin if i can use an artist name instead of my real name what are my limits and how does it work please help thanks you do not gain accreditation or the respect of your peers by using another artist's name and you can potentially attract a defamation claim or a claim for royalties for the association of the name with your work it seems prudent if not your own name to have a stage name but one that you invent it shows that you have more g in my opinion here we register the name as a company name trading name or business name to try to prevent others from using it once succesful  Art Public domain Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Recording Industry Association of America Publishing Insurance Copyright Fair use Photography Street photography Hedge fund Income trust Intellectual property Mediation Security (finance) Slander and libel Trademark United Kingdom corporation tax First Amendment to the United States Constitution Stock photography Graphics Daguerreotype Peer review Florida State University Corporation Traditional animation Reiki Baruch College Tort First flying machine Education in the United States Technicolor Guild Software patent debate British Royal Family Reparative therapy Bogdanov Affair Patent Surveillance Value added tax Corporate finance Unemployment Martial art Oral contraceptive Judicial functions of the House of Lords BDSM Surplus value Speed limit Peer-to-peer Cass Business School, London Abortion debate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hereditary peer Appropriation (art) Royalty and Diplomatic Protection Department Freedom of speech Roe v.

does it really make a difference if you get a high end digital camera doesn't do raw files i am looking at a really nice camera that doesn't have a raw feature but i've read from a couple of professional photographers that it's really not that important as far as controlling an image when you use software i have read that taking photos in 'raw' format has advantages over regular jpeg files but some professional photographers claim that if you use photoshop you can fix the images that no one can tell the difference what the original format was maybe you can click on the little pencil icon under your question and add details to tell us specifically which camera you are looking at raw would not be necessary for most photography pros might like it for the flexibility that it gives in image adjustments but i would bet that for every raw image that is taken or are taken in jpeg  Digital photography JPEG PNG Raw image format Image file formats Photography Digital image editing View camera Windows XP Photograph QuickTime Digital camera Screenshot ImageMagick GIF Traditional animation Panoramic photography Mouse (computing) Tagged Image File Format Macromedia Flash IPhoto Goatse.cx MP3 Camera IPod Canon EOS PlayStation Portable Digital single-lens reflex cameras Konica Minolta Photographic film Exchangeable image file format Apple Computer Stereoscopy JPEG 2000 Charge-coupled device Ebook Dither Technicolor Floppy disk Leica Digital cinema Common Unix Printing System Photographic lens RGB color model Medium format Enterprise content management Macro photography Disk image XML Data compression Nikon Corporation Nikon D70 Computer Musical Instrument Digital Interface Geographic information system MiniDisc File format Blog Canon T90 Movie projector ITunes Photojournalism Vorbis DVD Contax Digital video Rangefinder camera StuffIt Circle of confusion AmigaOS Bluetooth High-definition television Closed-circuit television 2D computer graphics Extreme Programming Image Microsoft Office Cinematography Electronic journalism Pixel Reality television Hubble Space Telescope Unicode Typeface Pixel art International Phonetic Alphabet Microsoft Paint PlayStation 3 Yearbook File Allocation Table B3ta Xbox 360 Digital rights management ATI Technologies

request for honesty jeez this is ridiculous someone asked a question in another section about the camera used on a tv show called side order of life okay at over points i don't care about frickin' points but the best answer so far says that the camera is a nikon dslr of some kind and it might be a nikon d xs all i'm sayin' is that the star of the show spends half of her time in the darkroom and her camera has a huge honkin' meter on the top with a large letter f on it there is another answer that identifies the camera as a nikon f photomic if you care about truth on yahoo and not leading an innocent asker down the wrong path please go to http answers yahoo com question index qid aalkoo r w pa aptqd bwhthf uebyaqxtv wcolovacn uzjkoofewqgourlmarx rt h kl xyasqr lhr qqaa paid voted and vote for the answer that names a camera that would produce images on film thus explaining all the time spent in the darkroom not to mention it's the correct answer let's put it this way do you think a photographer could tell the difference between this wrong answer http www bhphotovideo com c product reg nikon d xs slr digital camera html and this right answer http www bhphotovideo com c product use nikon f photomic tn camera html yeah it's pm and it's till degrees it was still at pm well vote for antoni on principle if you want but don't let the asker think that the camera is a d xs is all i'm sayin' and actually the question just says what camera is used on lifetime's 'side order of life ' nowhere does the asker suggest that she is actually using the camera if she is chances are the meter is broken anyhow unless there is some kind of battery upgrade steven you've missed the point it's not as if i said your name is stephen when it's really stephen it's as if i said your name is alexander when it's really steven the answer getting the most votes is patently wrong and i just don't think that photographers should stand for that it's not a matter of opinion or speculation as to whether the most iconic camera in the modern era has been modified to accept roll film where did that come from it's just a matter of aw who really cares anyhow i can stand it when i write a word individually researched answer and someone with a different opinion is chosen the best answer even by the asker but i can't stand when the answer is so far wrong and the asker will go out and buy a camera when she could get a used camera and be a proper poser koko if at first you don't succeed flickr a little harder joyfulpaints i hear ya this is probably the biggest reason i don't visit the dental section very often you can compose a detailed response suited particularly for a person's question and thenyou never hear any feedback fromthem at all i know that i have given answers there that would literally change a person's life and they don't have the courtesy to choose a best answer i hate to leave a question up for vote without choosing a best answer although sometimes i will do that if the question was for fun and games rather than for gaining information sometimes i just can't choose one over the other so i let the voters decide brian that's sort of my point i know that you take what you get as far as answers go yahoo would like it if we would use that sources box to post a link to our citation but almost nobody ever does and it doesn't make any difference if we do anyhow the dental section is so full of know it all know nothings who have their own opinion about things they have zero clue about that i almost feel dragged down by mixing my answer among their wrong wrong wrong answers it's like a friend of mine who said that he'd never run for public office because if he lost to the other people who were running he'd have to shoot himself and he's not ready to die teef i appreciate your honesty it might just be ten points worth of honesty good has triumphed over evil and the correct answer has been chosen now i can finally sleep at night thanks everyone i needed the points well dr sam the honest answer is drawing ahead on points maybe there is hope after all oh and whilst we are on the subject of honesty i posted this to get the two points all the best as always  Digital photography Theory of conduct Photography Digital single-lens reflex cameras Nikon Corporation Avenue Q Social rule Plame affair Philosophy of language Leica Abortion debate Whose Line Is It Anyway?

what would be the best way to go about getting an internship with a local photographer education is no higher than highschool but yet want to get education in the area of photography you don't need a college education in my opinion it's best to learn on the job look in the phone book under professional commercial photographers and call each photog and ask if they are looking for photo assistants i'm a photog myself and worked as a photo assistant in boston for several years pay ranges from a day to depending on experience if you really don't have any experience tell them you will intern for a while but then expect to be paid your duties will include things like loading film that is if they are still using film in which case they are behind the times getting cameras ready using photoshop to retouch photos setting up lighting equipment lugging around equipment running errands packing up and putting away equipment buying props for shoots keeping the studio clean etc if you don't know adobe photoshop learn it you will learn alot by working for several different types of photographers good luck it's a fun profession  Photography Digital photography Adobe Photoshop Photographic film Film Clapper loader Stereoscopy Surveillance Game programmer Panoramic photography Weekly newspaper Trademark Parachuting Photograph View camera Lightsaber Medium format Street photography Digital camera PNG Microsoft Office Social rule Professor IPod Konica Minolta Film crew Traditional animation Cinematographer Topps Physician Photojournalism IBM PC compatible Craps Intern Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Cover girl Paintball Single-lens reflex camera Colorist Pornography Education in the People's Republic of China James Van Der Zee Cruising (maritime) Camera General practitioner Yearbook Architect Sound design Machinima Bluetooth Photo manipulation Digital single-lens reflex cameras Depth of field Education in Germany Edward S.

how take model type pictures with a digital camera i have a coolpix l i want to get a pic of me to put on my cd cover i use photoshop cs for my graphics also just wanted to know how would i take very good picture quality like pics u see for models if not possible with this camera which one should i get to do this i would make sure that you're shooting with the highest image quality you can find out how to change that in the instructions for modeling type pictures the most importatnt thing is lighting usually the on camera flash will produce unflattering shadows or overexpose a face so you could ask around and see if anyone has any modelling lights that would be ideal failing that set up an indoor shoot with lots of different light sources so you don't have to use the on camera flash use a white piece of cardboard held in your lap to bounce light up thereby filling in shadowy areas on your face outdoors go for diffused light sun setting is a good time don't stand with your back to the sun get it so that it's on your face also simple backdrops outfits are good so lighting is the key play around with it diffused filtered by something lighting is best good luck  Digital photography Stereoscopy Road-rule enforcement camera Point and shoot camera Digital camera Photographic film Leica Lighting View camera Cinematography Adobe Photoshop Rendering (computer graphics) Color temperature Welding PIC microcontroller Ray tracing Drawing Liquid crystal display Digital cinematography Solar cell Single-lens reflex camera Film speed Contax Raw image format Gamut Computer vision Computer Traditional animation Camera Goatse.cx Movie projector Television Ra (board game) Digital image editing Syphon Filter Computer graphics Oscilloscope Camcorder Macro photography Film Billiards Patricia Ford Computer animation Motion picture terminology Volleyball RGB color model Shader Solar eclipse Analog-to-digital converter Red-eye effect Light-emitting diode Canon T90 Sunglasses The Ashlee Simpson Show 3D computer graphics NTSC Infrared Automatic number plate recognition Enlarger Mouse (computing) Konica Minolta Photograph Screenshot Embedded system Pinhole camera Time-lapse Archery Bob and George Houseplant Spirit rover Resident Evil 4 The Bill Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March 2D computer graphics Sun Cassini-Huygens Pornography Holography Autostereogram Parallax Marching band Nintendo 64 Closed-circuit television Digital camera back Canon EOS Medium format Opportunity rover ATI Technologies Motion capture Widescreen Binoculars Nikon Corporation Lightsaber Serial Game Boy Shen Gong Wu

what is the best way of taking pictures of really dark tunnels bunkers etc i read a few forums on the net where there are pictures taken within pitch black environments yet the photo is clear as day is this kind of photography possible with a standard digital camera or does it require an expensive slr the only way i know is to use a camera that has the facility to keep the shutter open for long periods you will also need some kind of light as it's impossible to photograph anything without light the whole point of a camera is to collect light you would also need a tripod and be taking a picture of a completely stationary object anything that moves in front of the camera while the shutter is open will appear as a blur think of those shots that show cars travelling at night and the long trails of the lights some digital cameras have this facility but they are often as expensive as slr models  Single-lens reflex camera Digital photography View camera Photography Leica Konica Minolta Shutter speed Digital camera Canon T90 Digital single-lens reflex cameras Macro photography Camera Automatic number plate recognition Canon EOS Photographic film Twin-lens reflex camera Panoramic photography Stereoscopy Street photography Movie projector Rangefinder camera Photograph Photographic lens Medium format Traditional animation Shutter (photography) Exposure (photography) Time-lapse Contax Film Camcorder Frame rate Nikon Corporation F-number Pinhole camera Road-rule enforcement camera Pentax Nikon FA Point and shoot camera Color temperature STS-62 Lighting Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Technicolor Computer High-definition television Surveillance Charge-coupled device Digital camera back Nikon FE2 Photojournalism Amateur astronomy Combine (Half-Life 2) Computer animation Film speed Digital Spirit rover timeline for 2005 March Cinematography Apollo 8 Floppy disk Traffic light Full frame digital SLR Zone system Golf A Geographic information system Bullet time Gamut Black hole Large format Speed of light Canon FD Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Parallax Color Closed-circuit television Enlarger Eye Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory S TGV Secure Digital card Advanced Photo System Digital art Filmmaking Pixel Bluetooth Cinerama Red-eye effect Computer vision Pornography Machine vision Digital cinematography Lens (optics) Anamorphic widescreen Rendering (computer graphics) Nikon FE

film developing i was told that there is now a product you can put your film in and it will scan it and turn it into digial pictures on your computer is this true and where would i find it i don't mean scanning already developed pictures onto your camera i was told you can take your unprocessed roll of film stick it into a device and it will read it and develop your pictures anyone else heard of this you do need to have your regular film developed before it can be scanned but once you have there are many scanners on the market that scan film there are those which are dedicated film scanners and there are flat bed document scanners with special holders and lights that isolate a frame of film and scan it at high resolution and even reverse it so it's not a negative i've got a fairly regular old canoscan d u and it scans negatives rp  Digital photography Image scanner Photography Konica Minolta Photographic film Digital cinematography Computed tomography Digital camera Pan and scan Surveillance Digital video Telecine Stereoscopy Anamorphic widescreen Computer virus View camera Magnetic resonance imaging Positron emission tomography Aspect ratio (image) Fax Frame rate Traditional animation Optical character recognition Philips Motion picture terminology OC-135B Open Skies Interlace Panoramic photography Barcode reader Pixel High-definition television Movie projector Bullet time Brain imaging Automatic number plate recognition Laserdisc Technicolor Bob and George Photograph Geographic information system Digital Luna 3 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind LIDAR Sound film Optical coherence tomography Mouse (computing) FireWire RFID Persistence of vision Digital camera back Alien vs. Predator (film) Cathode ray tube Universal Century Technology Warez 35 mm film Hewlett-Packard Photocopying Barcode Compact disc Windows XP Videotape Enlarger Rail terminology IMAX Oscilloscope Secure Digital card Film Panavision Computer animation Vladimir Zworykin Knight Rider Ebook Photolithography Film editing John Gaeta The End of the World (Doctor Who) Depth of field Lunar Orbiter program Portable Document Format Nintendo GameCube Camcorder Medical ultrasonography Macro photography IMac Spyware Microchip implant (animal) Charge-coupled device Opportunity rover Multifunction printer Computer Alien races from the Godzilla films E-Reader Digital cinema ZX Spectrum Video 720p

red eye question connected with red hair my boyfriend always gets red eye in photos even when others next to him don't would it have anything to do with his red hair and he has pale pink skin i'm curious because i never get red eye but he always looks like satan at one point he had it that many times i could have sworn that he'd tampered with them fair skin and red hair go along with lighter color eyes which are more prone to red eye than dark eyes for some reason although any eye color can show the red eye effect red eye is caused by the proximity of the flash to the camera lens that is why wedding photographers often have their flash mounted on brackets higher above the lens  Digital photography Light-emitting diode Red-eye effect Human skin color Digital camera Red hair Stereoscopy Color Hair color View camera Melanin Eye Dragon Booster Photography Cheetah Leica Canon EOS Albinism Red Sunglasses Traffic light Light DLP Iris (anatomy) Skin Black (people) Black Single-lens reflex camera Anaglyph image Physical attractiveness Macro photography Transformer Hair Rainbow Konica Minolta Dimension Bonus Stage Blond Cinematography Eyepiece Digital single-lens reflex cameras Color temperature Meriones unguiculatus Aberration in optical systems Rei Ayanami Charge-coupled device The Red Green Show Nuclear weapon design Radiation therapy Diamond enhancement Keeshond Pubic hair Contax Magical objects in Harry Potter Parallax Stage lighting Color blindness Photojournalism Camcorder Ultraviolet Photographic film Binoculars Panoramic photography Lens (optics) My Little Pony Telescope Cat coat genetics Marathon (computer game) Sun Autostereogram Barbie Conjunctivitis White (people) Canon EF lens mount The Ashlee Simpson Show Road-rule enforcement camera Drawing Dog Flash (photography) Laser hair removal Shampoo Totally Spies!

man ray who are photographers the new conservatives man ray who my daughter uses her mobile phone quite a lot these days i think there is a fresh new artistic style developing out of this technology and the likes of myspace and the importance of the re emergence of the self portrait and it seems worthy of exploration my thoughts lately are that professionals have tried to remain so elitist and fixed in their thinking that they can't transgress the post modern culture that they helped develop indeed instead of the arte nuveau i think many are the new conservatives too fixated on exposure settings and depth of field to recognise what fresh ideas young artists are now generating using their simple inexpensive tools and a home pc is the mobile camera phone the box brownie the new polaroid would you buy yorself anything costing more than if it will be obsolete technology in a month is this the age where the law of averages applies keep pressing the shutter button something exquisite will appear on pc later in a studio setting nater i can appreciate compltely your opinion on refining the technique but there is a whole lot of patience timing and luck involved in capturing a dynamic subject skill too in just the right light that you simply can't refine by re taking the shot thanks for those thoughts jack i also enjoy the idea that you can reduce pictorial art into lines shapes surfaces and colour what i like most is that kids seem to do this intuitively no training they havent heard of rodchenko these new kids on the block just think they know what they like and try to do it with whatever tool is available photoguy it's the accidental and anecdotal results that make their work so optimistic so interesting compared to yours i guess sneezecoughwheeze having technical knowledge is a miniscule part of the journey isn't it i mean just because you sell cameras doesn't make you an artist right true words of wisdom some of the so called elite may have some technical advantages such as lighting and contrast but i promise you what our kids are taking on their cell phones would draw more of a crowd in a manhattan art exhibit than some of the elite photographers i have only caught a glimpse of my grandsons' collection and they were not boring the salvador dalis' of the captured frame of a moment not lost to time well maybe not exactly but a true contemporary form of art works for black mail too  View camera Microeconomics Art Technology Stereoscopy Drawing Henri Cartier-Bresson Surveillance Extreme Programming Movie projector Leica Camera Single-lens reflex camera Konica Minolta Game programmer Supply and demand Floppy disk Modernism Surrealism Digital camera Logic Mathematics Comics Strategic management Mouse (computing) Piet Mondrian Computer Search engine optimization Land use forecasting Graphics Television Philosophy of language Cinematography Amateur astronomy Human Holography Enterprise content management Pottery Street photography Solar power Characters of Lost Science Hubble Space Telescope Apple Newton Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dither Martial art Panoramic photography Socrates Plame affair Bluetooth Philosophy of mathematics Traditional animation Scientific method Canon T90 TRIZ Alfred Hitchcock Time Out of Mind Kylie Minogue Public transport About a Boy Surrealist techniques Windows Vista Parallax Cognitive science Product Lifecycle Management Salvador Dal__ Special relativity Depth of field Open source culture Alexander Rodchenko Hip hop culture Telephone tapping Speech recognition Photojournalism Danger Hiptop Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Paragliding Motion capture Windows XP Requirements analysis Poker jargon Wealth Goodness and value theory Software patent debate London Congestion Charge EastEnders Welding Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Oscilloscope Nintendo Professional wrestling slang Electronic Arts

my mom glued my baby pictures and school pictures onto the paper and some onto album pages about years ago is there a way to remove them without ruining the pics i would like to put them in archival albums it would be ideal if you had the original negatives so that you can have them reprinted but i am assuming they are gone in this case then i would suggest before you do anything to have the images scanned after this what i would do is proceed to get a rubbermaid box and a humidifier the basic concept is that you are going to place a sheet of photos inside the box and gradually increase the humidity inside the box until the glue sepparates from the paper as there are a myriad of different types of humidifiers and rubbermaid containers you will have to use your imagination as to how to setup the humidifier box by the way this is a technique which will also work with images affixed to glass the one thing which you really want to avoid is heat as excessive heat will destroy the emulsion of the photograph as these photos are most likely rc prints or resin coated prints they are quite durable as they have an almost plastic like quality to them unlike older yet more aesthetically pleasing fiber based prints on a final note if the humidifier doesn't cause the glue to sepparate from the photo there is one final thing you can do you can always immerse the paper and the photos into a pan of cold water the key is to use cold water because hot water will cause the emulsion on the photo to peel all photos whether you are talking about rc prints or fiber based prints do in fact go through a water bath so as to clean any excessive chemicals off them in particular fix allowing the photos to immerse in cold water should cause the paper to disentegrate but at the same time the paper which is not archivally safe will release acids into the water once the paper is fully saturated with water you can peel the photo from the paper once you peel the photo from the paper i would suggest you run the photos in a continually bath of cold water for a few minutes to get rid of any acids which may have leached into the paper or surface anyhow like i said before you begin any of these procedures get the images scanned first without having the photos in hand and doing an evaluation of what process would work the best it is hard to say which procedure to take  Photography Photographic film Solar cell Printed circuit board Plastic Furnace Digital photography Milk Cookware and bakeware Pottery Solar power Water Glass Gramophone record Water purification Photographic paper Collodion process Enterprise content management Welding Traditional animation Magnetic resonance imaging Laser engraving Fiberglass Printmaking Floppy disk Tofu Nuclear power Paper Drawing Sterilization (microbiology) Soldering Jute Stereoscopy Temperature Cold fusion Movie projector Textile manufacturing terminology Aluminium Surrealist techniques Boat building Japanese tea ceremony Hand grenade Cannabis cultivation Upholstery Polyethylene terephthalate Electrophysiology C-41 process Knife Mattress Carbon nanotube Hamster Optical fiber Enlarger Carbon dioxide Technicolor Acne Explosive material Shroud of Turin Energy development Fire fighting Houseplant Etching Drill bit Bread Vitamin C Epoxy Hyperthermia Road-rule enforcement camera Bong Computer virus Tattoo Regular polytope Printing press Coffee Lighting Weathering Swimming Sento Perfume Bookbinding Drowning Color Naval mine Hydroponics Windows Vista Atari 8-bit family Internal ballistics Laser Tooth enamel Chromatography Cancer Brewery Nitrocellulose

canon a unbeaten after asking a good amount of people in college they have said that some of the 'old school' mm slr's are still unbeaten by the newer models one of the models that is very popular is the canon a about people in college have one and shoot a hell of a lot on it can today's models beat it i agree with your classmates that old school manually controlled slr's are some of the best cameras to learn on they allow you to learn the nitty gritty technical stuff that goes into taking a correct exposure i've owned a few older canon yachica and pentax manual slr's and to me there's very little difference between their features and performance as long as they haven't been sitting in a closet unused for years they'll continue to work very nicely for a long time a manual slr provides you with the control you need to approach photography from a creative standpoint other features like autofocus and automatic flash control for instance can provide a faster workflow if you need to work quickly i've photographed a few weddings during the last one i shot for about hours and turned out about pictures that would've been a nightmare working fully manually i wouldn't have been able to position myself focus take a light reading adjust for it set my flash etc for every shot quickly enough to keep up with everything that's going on i recently got a nikon f s camera which is older than the n i was using but it has every feature i could ever want in a mm camera it's built like a tank and has manual and automatic controls my favorite feature is that it can use nearly any nikon lens ever made manual or autofocus to me it's like the best of both worlds  Single-lens reflex camera Digital photography Konica Minolta Canon T90 Nikon Corporation Nikon FM2 Contax Nikon FE2 Leica Nikon FE Rangefinder camera Digital single-lens reflex cameras Nikon FM Camera Photography View camera Autofocus Pentax Photographic lens Macro photography Canon EF lens mount Cinematography Depth of field Nikon D70 Canon EOS-300D Advanced Photo System Camcorder Film Automatic transmission Full frame digital SLR Enlarger Canon PowerShot G Secure Digital card Twin-lens reflex camera Olympus (company) Street photography Binoculars Medium format Canon EOS-20Da Anamorphic widescreen Rebreather Floppy disk Canon T70 Exposure (photography) Amateur astronomy Technicolor Time-lapse M16 (rifle) Apollo 8 Panavision Computer Welding Metering mode Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 VHS Underwater photography GunZ The Duel Movie projector Pinhole camera Digital cinema Eye Zoom lens Shutter speed Praktica Aperture Firearm IPod Henri Cartier-Bresson Visual Basic Telescope Canon Inc.

optimal focal lenght on a zoom lens ok im still on this photography and lens sharing info forum buzz thing so please all contribrute so a zoom lens not a prime lets say a mm at what focal lenght will the lens be sharpest mm mm or mm if you know give a reason if you dont cool give a number and a theory or just a number my thanks is points to all one luck person will be chosen if its a tie then best theory explaination gets the big ten ive been told the answer but it could be wrong its got to do with the distance between the elements in the lens evan you are a genius wow thanks so much you are so valuable and your answers are dont know the words great is a little understated thanks there is no set answer to this resolution is commonly measured in mtf modulation transfer function a lens's peak mtf values will vary between different aperture settings and these values may peak at different focal lengths in a zoom lens for the purposes of this answer we will use the simplified imatest results from www photozone de which provides independent testing of slr lenses it is worthy of note that this testing uses aps c sensors so we will only talk about center resolution for now if we included border or extreme border it will only serve to increase the variability of the data and further illustrate my point example using the canon ef f l non is we can see that when shooting wide open the lens will achieve peak mtf at the short end mm with a value of lw ph however the peak mtf for the lens overall is at f at mm with a value of lw ph now if we compare this lens's little brother the f l non is we will find that overall peak mtf is at mm f interestingly this lens drops slightly in mtf at the mid range at and then picks up again at the long end this lens also peaks in sharpness at the short end when shooting wide open despite this variability there are a few general guides zooms are typically but not always softest at their long ends ultra wide angle zooms are often softest at their widest extreme standard zooms usually perform best in mtf around the mm mark of course lenses tend to peak in sharpness in mid aperture often around f ranges and then diffraction causes these values to begin to fall off somewhere around f or higher so to answer your example i can say that it is very likely that your hypothetical mm lens won't be sharpest at mm at any aperture whether it peaks at the short end or in the middle will depend on what the lens design wizards decided to prioritize in that particular model it will probably hit peak mtf around f the peak sharpness for wide open aperture shooting may differ from the overall peak mtf as well  View camera Photographic lens Leica Eyepiece Aperture F-number Depth of field Contax Diffraction Canon EF lens mount Photography Aberration in optical systems Cinematography Panoramic photography Antenna (radio) Digital camera Gravity Digital single-lens reflex cameras Anamorphic widescreen Headlight Reflecting telescope Canon T90 Clementine mission Nikon Corporation Angular resolution Normal distribution Single-lens reflex camera Synthetic aperture radar Laser DVD Knife Terminal ballistics Unicode IMAX Confocal laser scanning microscopy Hash table Optical fiber Nuclear weapon design Digital camera back History of telescopes Lighting C programming language Scientific method Explosive material Value system Perl Stage lighting Schneider Kreuznach Astronomical seeing Chinese language Pinhole camera Vowel Compiler optimization Extreme Programming Parallax Intelligence quotient Car handling Fast bowling Fuel injection Second language acquisition Eye Dog agility Floppy disk Internal ballistics Street photography Observational astronomy Modem Stereoscopy Trigonometric function Radar Sonar Film speed Canon FD Drill bit Grade (education) Ray tracing Microscope Human height Fisheye lens Camcorder Central processing unit Quizbowl Point and shoot camera Database

i'm taking my senior portraits today and i'm not looking forward to it i dont really know what i want to wear and i've got pimples all over my forehead and i just dont feel up to it but i've re scheduled about times so i have to take them today what can i do to make myself feel better it's not that i'm not confident it's just that i dont feel ready the first piece of advice i have for you is to wear something new even if it is just a new piece of jewelry or borrow something from someone this always makes me feel special rather than just wearing something that i always wear as for the pimples i know that it sucks to have blemishes and you dont fell you look your best when your skin isnt clear i take senoir pictures on the side and for my clients if they ask i photoshop out their blemishes on the pictures that they what to print i do it for free but some places might charge a little extra for it it never hurts to ask also don't cake on alittle of makeup to cover them up sometimes this just draws attention to the area smile and be confident and the attention will be drawn to your smile rather than your forhead for a more natural smile think of something that makes you happy or better yet bring a friend along they will make you feel more comfortable and make you smile i hope that this advice helps alittle good luck  Atomic Kitten Social rule Plame affair Care Bears Visit of King George IV to Scotland Mr. T Billboard (advertising) Jennifer Lopez Jon Secada Current teachings of Prem Rawat 613 mitzvot Aerial (dance move) Poker jargon Birthday Titanic (1997 film) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Sin City Upholstery Avenue Q Humphrey Bogart Our Friends in the North Mattress Pitaten Drawing Characters of Naruto James T.

product photography lets say a highly reflective object what type of lighting do you prefer defussed bounced key backlight fill light flash on off camera watts and distance if you want more want to know just angles etc example can be a cell phone lcd screen all contributions really apprieciated some awesome answers guys this is my area of expertise jewelry generally speaking highly diffused light is better for reflective materials there are exceptions however managing reflections often winds up mattering more than the quality of the light thus jewelry is typically shot in some sort of tent to make a uniform usually white reflection on the metallic surface it is vital to carefully control the angle at which light is hitting the reflective surface for your cell phone lcd if the light is hitting at a direct angle the light source may be reflected on the surface of the screen obscuring the display an oblique angle will help alleviate this issue even if you are using hard light so you could shoot your cell phone with highly diffused light but in this case high tech electronics i'd probably look at a hard light creating sharply delineated shadows but with the source hitting the screen on a very acute angle and thus not reflecting back into your lens much  Liquid crystal display Digital photography Solar cell Photography Stereoscopy Color Solar power Lighting Movie projector Digital camera Light-emitting diode Ray tracing Rendering (computer graphics) Diamond View camera Gamut Cathode ray tube Projection screen Organic light-emitting diode Canon T90 Polarization Welding Bicycle lighting 3D computer graphics Television Transistor Nuclear explosion Oscilloscope Eyepiece Cassini-Huygens Plasma display Lightsaber Laser Mirror Items in the Metroid series Lens (optics) Vacuum Casting Single-lens reflex camera Camera Diamond cut Wood Vacuum tube Cinematography Leica Impressionism Red-eye effect Digital single-lens reflex cameras Eye Contax Black hole Reflection (physics) Iris (anatomy) Anamorphic widescreen Knife Mouse (computing) Diffraction Sewage treatment Gas metal arc welding Parallax Stage lighting Film Liquid crystal display television Liquid crystal Microscope Terminal ballistics Microphone Nuclear weapon design Cinerama Transformer Volleyball Diamond simulant Drawing Renewable energy Light Silver Panoramic photography Galileo spacecraft Gas tungsten arc welding Handheld game console Cannabis cultivation Wallpaper group Bloodstain pattern analysis TFT LCD Depth of field Surveillance Solar panel Optical coating Photographic lens Traditional animation Holography Geographic information system Optical fiber Piezoelectricity Parabola Membrane potential Speed of light

optimum fstop for clarity little distortion i know there no answer but ones closer than the others sharpness as oppossed to depth thanks joe nice to hear from you as always a dr are you talking about the f club sorry no disrespect cant email you sorry the f club im not a member they are worth a look on the net though nice work doug group f group nice work carl thanks a in general lenses are sharpest at about the middle of the aperture range at the center of the image lenses are often sharpest one or two stops down from max aperture as others have noted but this not the case at the edge of the frame at the edge it is usually sharper at smaller apertures perhaps up to about f so when the question is at what aperture is a lens sharpest then answer has to be it depends however for the overall average sharpness across the whole frame is considered usually it is in the middle of the range say f to f  Depth of field Aberration in optical systems View camera Eyepiece Telescope Contax Aperture Bokeh IMAX Photographic lens Stereoscopy Cinematography Photography Reflecting telescope Confocal laser scanning microscopy Knife Fisheye lens Single-lens reflex camera Zeiss Panoramic photography 70 mm film Pinhole camera Diffraction Autostereogram Antenna (radio) Leica Widescreen 35 mm film Microscopy Anamorphic widescreen Canon EF lens mount Floppy disk Angular resolution Algebraic geometry Konica Minolta Movie projector Schneider Kreuznach Stage lighting Brewery Digital photography Exposure (photography) Zoom lens Guitar Eyeglass prescription Extrasolar planet Clementine mission Camera Shutter speed Technicolor Amateur astronomy Spark plug Synthetic aperture radar Pixel Microeconomics Astronomical seeing Drill bit Maxilla Sphenoid bone Enlarger Digital single-lens reflex cameras Canon T70 Trumpet Shaggy dog story Roxette Piano The Beach Boys Transmission electron microscopy Circle of confusion Violin Bass guitar Film Microscope Street photography Television History of telescopes Galileo spacecraft Full frame digital SLR Green Bay Packers Black hole Gravitational lens Joel and Ethan Coen Pet Sounds Canon T90 Carl Zeiss Federal Standard 1037C Timpani PNG Adaptive optics Motion picture terminology Macro photography Wheel of Fortune Vignetting Film speed Parallax Plame affair Harpsichord Drawing

how do i clean up old photographs for scanning and printing b w and colour personally i don't clean them too much i don't want to damage anything if they have a good hard surface i wipe them with a soft woven cotton cloth read undershirt mostly i scan them at high resolution like dpi and clean them in photoshop elements see http www flickr com photos samfeinstein for an example where i was afraid to clean a photo too much with the creases and folds there were tears in the emulsion and i was afraid that any cleaning would lift up little corners and break away parts of the picture there was so much wrong with this picture that i just left some degree of aging there as we all knew the age of the picture it's kind of a special effect in its own right here's another one that i put up for this question and my family this is an example of what happens when you don't rinse out the fixer adequately but it's also an example of a picture that i was afraid to clean very much at all you clean it in post processing http www flickr com photos samfeinstein antoni as far as compressed air be careful first of all turn the photo upside down when you blow on it second be aware of possible chemical reactions with some of them i can't tell you which ones but i have seen cases where compressed air interacted with photos and left water spots on the photo i have a can of dust blaster right here and it's not air it says tetrafluoroethane use quick little bursts and not a steady stream so it will be less likely to condense and pool on the photo  Textile manufacturing Image scanner Diving Digital photography Ice core Nuclear explosion Mattress Drill bit Carbon dioxide Brewery Floppy disk World Wide Web Cathode ray tube Gramophone record Internal ballistics Butterfly Photographic film Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Movie projector Explosive material Nuclear fallout Nuclear weapon design Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Social rule Paper Aerial (dance move) HyperText Transfer Protocol Dry cleaning Haloalkane Helium Pixel Stereoscopy JPEG Equine conformation Textile manufacturing terminology Tagged Image File Format Hard disk London Bong Laserdisc Hard water Knife Car washing techniques Universal Century Technology Dishwasher Carburetor PNG Hat Mouse (computing) Uniform Resource Locator Japanese tea ceremony X-ray Solar power High-definition television Water Furnace Radiation therapy Warez Air pollution Glossary of firefighting equipment Professional wrestling slang Cold fusion Fast bowling Professional wrestling holds Strap-on dildo H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Geographic information system Pebble bed reactor Wok Thermal power station Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Drowning Bob and George Sento Flickr Photo sharing Gamma ray burst Snooker Roswell UFO incident Tank Eye Seismic retrofit Upholstery Theory of conduct Tire Hydrochloric acid Vacuum cleaner Collecting fossils Plastic Digital image editing Autopsy 2005 Kashmir earthquake Flax Car handling Sutro Tower Weaving Bridge Cloud

advice from professional photographers and photojournalists please ok so i am in high school right now and for the last two years photography has been my main focus i've never had this drive for anything else in my life i'm constantly taking pictures learning new skills and it's all i talk about with any passion i'm also really into writing and am therefore wanting to be either a photographer or photojournalist but my question is is there any job security with being a photographer with the internet videos and how digital has taken over are photographers still going to be in demand a lot of people have suggested to me to just keep it as a hobby because the outlook isn't very favorable is that correct it's not that i want a huge paycheck but i do want a job and the possibility of great success and i just want to know how competive is the field in photography and what the outlook is i have some photos on deviantart www browniemonster deviantart com if you'd like to check them out or critique thanks for any help and suggestions correct link www browniemonster deviantart com a very good question firstly until a camera can always meter for light correctly can set up and arrrange lights and manipulate available light can artistically compose shots can select the correct apepture and shutter speed to give artistic results and advise the photographer what view points are needed then there will always be a demend for professionals the demand for professional images is growing particuarly for low res internet images of quality job security unless you become a reporter security isnt really part of the deal if you work on the writing as well it will open alot of doors for you images with words are worth more in the market place my english is poor so i work with for writers time in the business is the best security if you build a good client list and some asset like say a collection of stock images dont know how to view you pix link would be good suggestions use a tripod whenever you can expose and focus manually whenever you can when you talk about your passion dont say taking photos thats what anyone with a camera can do start saying and doing this i have been making lots of images take it or leave it my point is theres nothing great about taking photos planing an image in your mind setting up and controling light selecting the best depth for the image exposing perfectly and controlling focus are what great photographers do they dont take pictures they make them great to hear you have the most important asset needed passion a  View camera Digital photography Stereoscopy Photojournalism Panoramic photography Konica Minolta Single-lens reflex camera Cinematography Leica Street photography Canon T90 Shutter speed Digital camera Enterprise content management Camera Photographic film Depth of field Autostereogram Macro photography Goatse.cx Canon EOS Floppy disk Photograph DeviantART Economics Exposure (photography) Contax Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Digital art Apollo 8 Art Movie projector Camcorder F-number Photographic lens Blog Closed-circuit television Technicolor Film Pornography Enlarger Oscilloscope Computer World Wide Web Plame affair Extreme Programming Surveillance Television PlayStation Portable Capital accumulation Anamorphic widescreen Traditional animation Theory of conduct Mutual fund Digital single-lens reflex cameras Charge-coupled device Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Canon EF lens mount Enron Corporation Librarian Shutter (photography) Independent Media Center Aperture Scientology beliefs and practices Opportunity rover Inflation Electronic journalism IMAX Film speed Road-rule enforcement camera Henri Cartier-Bresson Eyepiece Apollo 11 The Shining (film) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Internet fraud Aikido ITunes Reflecting telescope Bluetooth Motion capture Mojave people CPU design Microeconomics Rudolf Steiner Holography Circle of confusion Political economy Automatic number plate recognition Past teachings of Prem Rawat X Window System Strategic management

why do photographers wear black well not all of them but most of them my professor wears black almost every meeting if not black then white what's with the colour anyway to go to the last question first black is the absence of a colour as much as white is the presence of every colour there are several reasons for wearing black black clothing flatters older men by disguising some more obvious degradation of their once wonderful physique why younger men follow this trend rather than wear wonderful coloured clothing is beyond me but they do black disguises dirt and grime better than other colours so if you are working in dirty conditions it is easier to still look cool in black than it would be if you were wearing dirty white clothing roadies photographers etc find this a useful characteristic black is a better colour for blending in than other colours or white it is low contrast in many urban situations and allows the photographer to blend into the background this is particularly useful where the photographer wants to faithfully record other's actions and not be engaged as a protagonist in the events for the same reason wearing black can reduce the intrusion of the photographer into the recorded image such as those where highly reflective surfaces might reveal the photographer's presence a photographer wearing black on a black background can hide in the image black gloves balaclava and full length sleeves and trouser legs complete the ensemble at this stage one might want to be careful about being mistaken for someone with more sinister intent than mere photography  Photograph Gramophone record Japanese tea ceremony Digital photography Surveillance Color Black tie Leggings Fencing Nudity Cross-dressing Photography Camouflage Policing in the United Kingdom Skirt and dress Mess dress Social aspects of clothing Snooker Sin City Grace Cossington Smith Brave New World Morning dress Academic dress of Oxford University Puppet Clothing Military uniform Color theory Aikido Doctor (Doctor Who) The Amazing Race Dragon Booster Isaac Newton's early life and achievements Traditional animation Handloading Motorcycle Infantilism Lighting Rainbow Mourning Hakama Fast bowling Kimono Paul Is Dead Skinhead The Adventures of Tintin Comanche Swimming pool Ozone depletion Photographic developer Blackadder Men in Black Trousers Grunge music White (people) Suit (clothes) G-Man (Half-Life) Colours, standards and guidons Welding The Beatles (album) The Dalek Invasion of Earth Swimming Cinematography Heavy metal fashion Stereoscopy Albedo Planet of the Apes Hazing Harrow School Human skin color Social rule Saruman Child pornography Aberration in optical systems Order of the Garter Protective clothing Photographic paper Gamut Undergarment Color blindness Holography St. John Ambulance Black Kilt GIF Beachwear K' Diamond Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Bicycle lighting Diamond enhancement Urban heat island Final Fantasy IX Igneous rock Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Sunglasses Strap-on dildo Plastic Sea Scouts (BSA) Fire fighting

income for photographers i'm thinking more of a geographical photographer and wildlife photographer depending how good you are at shooting and marketing your images will depend on your income you can starve one year and be feasting the next you can submit to a stock agency for sales but those can sometimes only dribble in as income so you can not count on that until you really make it in this area have a look at this site and check their submission guide lines and if you can match theirs you could match others http www alamy com contributors default asp every magazine on a monthly basis needs to put pictures into their journal and there are the regulars that write the articles and most of the time not always use their photos so to get yourself noticed by the editor you need to have technicaly perfect images captions need to be correct and it also helps if you add the camera information example nikon d xs mm lens th etc now if you really want to make a sale you should write an article ms manuscript of what you are submitting example how to shoot wild moose you could give the best times to go out and shoot where to find them the technical ways on how you shot these images etc etc doing the writting means the editor does not have to worry about doing anything but proofing and sending it to the press and you getting paid for it but you need to do your home work you need to know about that magazine if you can buy it at the newstands do it if not contact them for a copy see if there was a recent article about wild moose or something like it if the article is older than years you stand a good chance of making a sale this is because newer readers have not read the article and older readers need to be re freshed make sure when contacting the editor you get the right person new editor would not like this you can find out about a magazine by looking at the masthead either towards the front or back of the magazine a magazine has about a month lead time so try and get your articles to them in time for christmas summer vacation etc a good source for a lot more information is the photographers market handbook which you can find at amazon com here you will find book publishers poster companies ad agencies stock and many more p s you don't have to go to formal school to learn photography as long as you are good and you have the determination to succed hope this helps kevin  Digital photography Photography Publishing Surveillance Independent Media Center Yearbook Editor Amiga Power Plame affair MAD Magazine Screenplay Annuity Panoramic photography Ajax (programming) Stock photography Photojournalism Peer review Single-lens reflex camera C plus plus Fair use View camera Nikon Corporation Apollo 8 Stereoscopy Academic publishing Domain Name System Playboy (magazine) Style guide Nintendo Power Short selling Kylie Minogue Cinematography Gray Wolf Blog Internet fraud The Standard On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Goatse.cx Leica Slashdot trolling phenomena Virginian Railway Publication of Darwin's theory Film H2G2 Mixed martial arts Newspaper Everything2 Photographic film Crossword Konica Minolta Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina HyperText Transfer Protocol Photographic lens The Guardian Media in the People's Republic of China Microeconomics FairTax Canon EOS Private Eye United Kingdom corporation tax Marvel Comics Lens (optics) Surplus value Oasis (band) Depth of field Slashdot subculture Technicolor NME Digital camera Copyright Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Apple Computer Extreme Programming Weekly newspaper Digital single-lens reflex cameras Logic Houston Chronicle Legal research Movie projector Comics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The New York Times Warren Buffett Topps Douglas Adams PNG The Economist DeviantART PHP Patricia Ford Rangefinder camera Bond Supply and demand Open access

how do i make a blend picture out of my own pictures how do i make a blend picture out of my own pictures does it require a special service or can i just make one for free on a website essentially you need a photo manipulation program to do this the most common and popular application for this is adobe photoshop if you have photoshop or a similar application then you can put your pictures on different layers and adjust the transparency of the pictures using various keying and masking techniques to create a blend of your choice you can do this at home on your own computer and get the result printed like a normal photo in photoshop for example you can start with a blank x inch or x inch frame or any other size you want and add your picture to it layer by layer and mix and match using all the techniques that the software can provide if what you want to do is merge pictures to create a panorama then that too is possible in photoshop for most photo manipulation jobs you rarely need to look any further it a whole new world out there for photoshop users enjoy  Adobe Photoshop 2D computer graphics PNG GIMP Microsoft Office MP3 Adobe Systems Digital photography Macromedia Flash Ebook Digital image editing Game programmer Screenshot IPhoto Traditional animation Windows Vista Portable Document Format Bryce Mouse (computing) Common Unix Printing System JavaScript Windows 2000 IPod Computer Adobe Illustrator Photoshopping Finale notation program Database Mac OS X Warez Apple Macintosh Anamorphic widescreen Operating system Gramophone record Carbon (API) Copy protection Compact audio cassette Object-oriented programming Trademark Floppy disk Linked list Laserdisc HyperCard Geographic information system PostScript Internet protocol suite AmigaOS Printed circuit board Mach kernel Technicolor Macromedia Fireworks Pornography OpenOffice.org Emacs 3D computer graphics Atari ST Password Enterprise content management Tagged Image File Format Synthesizer Amateur telescope making MDAC Lisp programming language Cocoa (API) Web page Netfilter/iptables Drill bit BASIC programming language Expert system Common Lisp Photograph Adobe Acrobat Architecture of Windows 2000 Tux Paint Panoramic photography Computer virus Atari 8-bit family Nude celebrities on the Internet WindowBlinds Transport layer Apple typography Compact disc Goatse.cx Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Microsoft Desktop publishing Mac OS X v10.4 Strap-on dildo Digital audio workstation Redundant array of independent disks OpenDocument Software engineering Python programming language

does anyone know a photographer by the name will sterling i believe he lives around the memphis tn area but i'm not sure hi awb i met the will sterling once it was a few weekends ago i was walking to the corner market for a loaf of bread when i had to pass by a neighborhood church i was somewhat acquainted with the structure as it was always mentioned in the newspaper s community section known as the loft folks would gather there on thursday evenings for poetry readings however this day happened to be a saturday afternoon and a pair of gentlemen greeted me as i walked by they invited me in to sample an hour of their presentation ok i went inside and found myself to be a prospective new recruit for their brand of religion most of the pews were filled with hooded monks chanting a haunting rhythm there were others who like me were wearing their regular denims the service began like most others that church goers would be familiar with a grand master of ceremonies led the group through some songs and gave a sermon near the end of the hour it was time for their ritual of laying on of the hands some of the parishioners would come forward and ask for prayers for their ailments or for a sick grand mum who fell down in the tub all the hooded dudes whose faces could not readily be seen would all place a hand on the person and their combined energies were presumed to have a strength and expedite a solution to the problem ok now there was another new guy in the pews who was watching eagerly i recognized will sterling from a wanted poster viewed earlier at the post office when he saw a chance he approached the ring of conspirators and described how he was always moving around and never able to settle down the hooded goons closed in upon him all to make a physical connection the master of ceremonies began a prayer a dogmatic mix of logic and pure hocus pocus i immediately saw the effects of the procedure as the tension went out of will sterling s body when the beseeching was near an end the master asked are the brothers ready a suspenseful few moments passed until he almost shouted now on that cue the brothers began to pummel their hapless victim continually delivering blows over head and to the solar plexus until will sterling was down on the floor getting stomped after another minute the grand pooh bah decided the treatment administered was sufficient to induce a relaxing calm that would assuage the shaky leg syndrome of will sterling for a long long time i can t say for certain if will sterling got the comeuppance he deserved as i had a loaf of bread to buy and some other errands to do that day i hope for you awb that you do find a sense of closure to this difficult episode of life and be sure to put on your best sympathy face if anyone ever asks about will sterling  Prayer Eastern Orthodox Church Shaggy dog story Mass (liturgy) Funeral of Pope John Paul II Meat Loaf Eucharist Roman Catholic Church Tridentine Mass Baptism Professional wrestling attacks Funeral Professional wrestling aerial techniques Glossary of partner dance terms Columbine High School massacre Canonical hours About a Boy Religious Society of Friends Scientology beliefs and practices Royal Assent Jewish bereavement Escape from New York Baptist The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Professional wrestling holds RuneScape quests Apollo 8 Social rule The Inside Novus Ordo Missae Philipp Melanchthon Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Rule of St Benedict Battle of Jutland Charles Darwin's views on religion Plame affair John Wycliffe Saturday Night Live Fasting Abortion debate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Aerial (dance move) Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Sydney Riot of 1879 Humphrey Bogart Hypoglycemia 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Poker jargon Japanese tea ceremony Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Community of Christ A Course In Miracles Sharon Tate Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Sant Thakar Singh Sumo Academia Westminster School Swingout Vespers Insomnia Boxing Tenshinhan YuYu Hakusho Church of Christ, Scientist Fort Ashby, West Virginia Surveillance Conspiracy (TNG episode) Reiki Mojave people Professional wrestling slang Hypnosis Hulk Hogan Donald Neilson Jewish services John Wesley Massage Atheism Men in Black Iglesia ni Cristo Rose (Doctor Who) Texas Revolution Past teachings of Prem Rawat Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina First English Civil War Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban National Football League Muslim ibn Aqeel I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Abbey Easter Neuro-linguistic programming

will photos on a disk start to fade after five years someone said that photos on a disk will start to fade after fiver years and that you should back them up to keep them i never heard this before is it true it it is how can i prevent this it isn't the photo on the disk that will fade the photos on disk are just a digital file i think what the person was talking about was medium used to make cd r can degrade from the cd r wiki at present stated cd r lifetimes are estimates based on accelerated aging tests as the technology has not been in existence long enough to verify the upper range with proper care it is thought that cd rs should be readable one thousand times or more and have a shelf life of several hundred years unfortunately some common practices can reduce shelf life to only one or two years therefore it is important to handle and store cd rs properly if it is necessary to read them more than a year or so later real life not accelerated aging tests have revealed that some cd rs degrade quickly even if stored optimally burned cd rs suffer from material degradation just like most writable media cd r media have an internal layer of dye used to store data in a cd rw disc the recording layer is made of an alloy of silver and other metals indium antimony and tellurium in cd r media the dye itself can degrade causing data to become unreadable as well as degradation of the dye failure of a cd r can be due to the reflective surface while silver is less expensive and more widely used it is more prone to oxidation resulting in a non reflecting surface gold on the other hand although more expensive and no longer widely used is an inactive material and so gold based cd rs do not suffer from this problem permanent markers are commonly used to mark the label side of cd rs and dvds this practice has been discouraged because it is believed xylene and toluene common substances in permanent marker ink can cause surface deterioration additionally volatile organic compounds may be released which will remain inside the enclosed atmosphere of a cd r's storage box causing harm one last factor that affects the quality of a cd r and influences its lifespan is the lacquer that is used to seal the cd r and protect the dye and the reflective material from the influence of external materials air water alcohol etc  CD-R Compact disc Gramophone record Laserdisc Hard disk DVD Welding Explosive material Digital photography Aluminium Corrosion Digital rights management Enterprise content management MP3 Carbon dioxide Vacuum tube Solar cell Ultraviolet Mach kernel Backup Gas metal arc welding USB flash drive Password Ice core Paint Gasoline Commodore 64 Terminal ballistics Nuclear power Ozone depletion Disk storage Enzyme Geographic information system Drill bit Casting Ammonia Inflation Bong Japanese tea ceremony Sea level rise Audiophile Stereoscopy Mineral File Allocation Table Oscilloscope Blu-ray Disc Sewage treatment Silver Copy protection Glass Laser 8 mm video format Mattress Linked list PlayStation 3 Ecology Motorcycle DVD-R Windows XP Battery (electricity) Ozone hole Inkjet printer Movie projector Phonograph Sound recording Hydrogen economy Gold standard Atari 8-bit family CD recorder Carburetor Atari ST Hydrochloric acid Warez Hubble Space Telescope Digital circuit Geology of the Moon MiniDisc Hand grenade Alcohol fuel Loudspeaker Spark plug Data recovery Deforestation Pottery Nickel-cadmium battery

art value of photos using photoshop filters like watercolor when selling photographs has anybody had luck when using photoshop filters like watercolor fresco etc i like the artistic value of some shots with the filters to make them not seem like photos what are some opinions about trying to sell tweaked photos like that also would this work if these were glicee prints on canvas would they really look like paintings my years of experience has always been w film i'm behind the times w digital but like the possibilities please send any opinions about selling digital prints using different 'artsy' procedures it depends on your audience people that are familiar with photography are also familiar with the filters and plug ins of photoshop most will not give too much artistic merit for clicking on an action true art is more than just pretty colors it is an expressions of our humanity it is a catalyst for what we are trying to communicate of course there is an audience for everything look at the success for the mass produced painting of thomas kincade  Photography Adobe Photoshop Art Traditional animation Drawing Fine art photography Stereoscopy Paint Watercolor painting Photographic film Digital art Pornography Georgia O'Keeffe 2D computer graphics Gamut Graphic design Colorist Film Cinematography Painting Thomas Kinkade Digital camera Color theory IPhoto GIMP Leica Technicolor Artemisia Gentileschi Game programmer Macro photography Airbrush Audiophile Black-and-white E.

i have a kodak z with a telephoto lens need help i just got the x lens for the camera along with the adapter tube and without the lens it takes great pictures even at full zoom but with the lens on at full or even half zoom there seems to be a purpleish haze around things and a little bit out of focus does anyone know what is causing this uv filters are used to reduce haziness created by ultraviolet light a uv filter is mostly transparent to visible light and can be left on the lens for nearly all shots uv filters are often used for lens protection much like clear filters a strong uv filter such as a haze a or uv cuts off some visible light in the violet part of the spectrum and so has a pale yellow color these strong filters are more effective at cutting haze and can reduce purple fringing in digital cameras strong uv filters are also sometimes used for warming color photos taken in shade with daylight type film http en wikipedia org wiki photographic filter also here is a step by step link for using a kodak close up lens http www kodak com eknec pagequerier jhtml pq path pq locale en us  Digital photography Cinematography Photography Ultraviolet View camera Macro photography Color Technicolor Contax Digital camera Photographic lens Panoramic photography Zoom lens Single-lens reflex camera Leica Light-emitting diode Polarization Digital camera back Anamorphic widescreen Canon EOS Color temperature Movie projector Digital single-lens reflex cameras Traffic light Color blindness Eastman Kodak Cassini-Huygens Camera Lens (optics) Lighting Film Depth of field Glass Schneider Kreuznach Rangefinder camera Fluorescent lamp Enlarger Pinhole camera Light Traditional animation Konica Minolta Filter (optics) Stage lighting Observational astronomy Sunglasses Rainbow Film speed Gamut Charge-coupled device IMAX Apollo 8 Clementine mission 35 mm film Nuclear explosion Chromatic aberration Lightsaber RGB color model Point and shoot camera Laser Shutter speed Ray tracing Uniform Resource Locator Nintendo 64 Reflecting telescope Television F-number Tank Incandescent light bulb Super 8 mm film Diamond enhancement Autostereogram Camcorder Optical coating Telescope Federal Standard 1037C Nikon Corporation Advanced Photo System Movie camera Low-pass filter Photograph Color theory Gamma ray burst Rayleigh scattering Aperture Widescreen Titan (moon) Cinerama Eyepiece Grayscale Anaglyph image Four Thirds System

what to do iam confused i have a digital camera the confusion is whether to keep it on or switch it off when you have gaps between each shot say for example iam in a museum i find something interesting i shoot a picture but iam not really sure how soon i will take the next picture i switch it off to save power but have to keep switching it on is this the right way or i just leave it on you can adjust your settings so that if you don't take a picture for a minute or so it goes into power saver mode  Mouse (computing) The Cure Digital photography PlayStation Portable Television Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Oscilloscope Secure Digital card Depth of field Kirby's Adventure Transistor Digital cinema Stereoscopy Digital circuit Movie projector Digital cinematography Widescreen Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Digital camera Digital Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Pixel Electronic amplifier Panavision Bluetooth 8 mm video format Canon T90 STS-61 Super Mario Bros.

how much should i charge an old friend for the digital file of a photograph i'm starting a photography business an old friend wants some photos of her band and for me to design the album cover i thought about giving her the digital files so she can have them for whatever else how much should i charge for everything or give me a price for the digital files of the photos yes will be high resolution your photographs have worth if your friend wants to use them for her cd cover the idea posed by others to do it for free is in my opinion bad business and bad for the friendship is your friend giving the cd away for free i doubt it so why should you give your work away for free with that said you should charge an hourly rate for designing her cd cover and a usage fee based on how many cd's she is going to produce for the actual image personally i wouldn't give her the high resolution shots for other uses unless she paid for that as well what you charge though should be based on the uniqueness of the image and what the market is willing to pay for bands that don't earn a lot of money i don't go overboard on my fees i do though take into account how much they are going to sell the cd for and base my usage fee on a percentage of the first run using cd's as a starting point if they do a first run of less then cd's i still use the run point and will give them the license to cover that amount if they do future runs over then the band will owe additional usage but it is still based on the initial percentage keep in mind that due to anti trust laws i nor should anyone else give you actual rates in such a public forum it gives the idea of price fixing which is against the law charge what you feel comfortable charging and by all means don't give your work away if you are serious about photography and want to be a professional then be one and charge for your work if you charge pennies then you are telling others that your work is worth pennies you should go to the asmp website for help on writing your terms and conditions http asmp org commerce legal terms conditions back php they also have info on model releases here http asmp org commerce legal releases and a copyright tutorial here http asmp org commerce legal copyright you might want to also consider joining asmp's pro advice forum on yahoo it is open to members and non members and dedicated to helping emerging professional photographers you can join by going here http tech groups yahoo com group asmpproadvice keep in mind that they too won't give you actual pricing info but you can respond or call someone directly if you have a specific question hope that helps and by all means do not give your work away  Copyright Digital photography Copyleft SCO-Linux controversies Intellectual property Taxation in the United States GNU General Public License Apple Computer Photography Microeconomics BitTorrent Tax Public domain Mutual fund Mortgage Credit card Bond Open access Microsoft Inflation Fair use SCO v.

why do you think some people do not like taking photographs photography is ok for me i'm certainly not an enthusiat but there're always people disliking taking photographs not only of themselves but also others i can't understand why isn't is good to have some of your memories saved in a hardware some people aren't comfortable taking their own pictures so they settle for second hand memories pictures someone else took it takes time and practice to do any new skill some don't care to learn it others are afraid of being judged harshly that's too bad to me photography is a personal art form and journal those are memories that will last notice what people do when a flood or tornado comes besides the family treasures they save the photos i think that says a lot don't you but i don't mind if a person doesn't want to take pictures that's their choice however it is a bit imposing to ask can you take a picture for us or can we get a copy of that i mean i'm flattered but there are times i've missed the photo i wanted because i was preserving someone else's memory with today's cameras it's easier than ever all one has to do is try  Photography Theory of conduct Stereoscopy Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Photograph Social rule Digital photography Surveillance Time Out of Mind Aesthetic Realism Humphrey Bogart Photojournalism Panoramic photography Kender Traditional animation Digital camera Henri Cartier-Bresson Dyslexia Unemployment W.
