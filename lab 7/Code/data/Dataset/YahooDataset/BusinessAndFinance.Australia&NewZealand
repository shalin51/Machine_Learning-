can someone tell me if it is possible to salary sacrifice a car lease in nsw i would like hubby to consider a new job same pay less hours but no car the less hours is the part we like i was wondering if it's possible to lease a car for his work and if it effects his tax etc he works in transport industry but in an office as long as the employer is agreeable a car lease can certainly be salary sacrificed a common solution is via novated lease which is a tripartite agreement between employee employer and a lessor while the employee remains with the employer the employer takes responsibility for the lease payments once the employee leaves the employer the novation lapses and the employee becomes directly responsible for the lease in simple terms the car goes with the employee when they leave while the novation is in place all running expenses of the vehicle including the lease payments can be salary sacrificed but on the flip side the employee will also pay fringe benefits tax on the vehicle care needs to be taken when entering these arrangements as the fbt can significantly reduce or negate any tax benefit achieved from salary sacrifice make sure you do your numbers beforehand and just a response to the answer below once a vehicle is structured into your salary there is no other tax break or deduction available outside sacrificed costs regardless of business or personal use  Leasing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tax Microeconomics Taxation in the United States Salary Insurance Unemployment benefit Salary cap 401(k) Social Security (United States) Airline Student loan Unemployment Compensation of employees Economy of the United States Publicly funded medicine Education in England Leasehold estate Flat tax Operating surplus Gross domestic product United Kingdom corporation tax Health insurance Wal-Mart Child support Economic inequality Surplus value Life insurance Pension Hybrid vehicle Food Stamp Program London Congestion Charge Sport utility vehicle Minimum wage Principal-agent problem National Insurance Tariff Income trust Domestic partnerships in California Employment Centrelink Great Depression New Deal Contract Personal rapid transit Outsourcing Expert system Wayne Corporation Progressive tax FairTax Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 United States Postal Service Economy of India Alcohol fuel Islamic banking Intermediate consumption Labour economics C__ile Ferate Rom__ne Tax credit Personal finance Rail transport in Great Britain Reaganomics Transport in Hong Kong Inflation Amtrak Working time GO Transit Trust (Law) non-USA Airbus Arturo Frondizi Article One of the United States Constitution History of the United States (1918-1945) Value added tax Toll road Freeters Delta Air Lines United Airlines Capitalism Renting Lloyd's of London Assignment (law) Auto insurance Subsidy Automobile Health savings account New York Central Railroad Day care Contract with America Labor theory of value Economic history of Japan Efficiency wages

why did you introduce a major change to our taxation system from sales tax to gst without a referendum i do know at the time you said because you had been elected you had a mandate from the people but to do what you want if any responsible leader of any country were to dramatically change that taxation system then don't you agree that the change ought to be ratified by the people's vote on that very critical change or is it a dictitorial decision that because i am your leader then i will do what ever i want because the majority in this case not elected me i found and still find that decision reprehensible mr howard i trust that you will have a peaceful retirement from having to make decisions and overide the needs of the australian people in spite of their well being and best interests we have paid far too much and far too well for your dotage yes remember him saying there will never ever be a gst under my government the old core and non core promises had to love janette recently saying in defense of her deceitful hubby that sometimes he just says he's going to do something but that doesn't mean he is going to really or something hilarious to that effect it was inevitable since the asprey report in the 's that under a liberal government at some point we were going to get a high revenue raising broad based tax such as gst of which a greater burden is borne by low income earners because it is not a progressive tax liberals opposed the labor introduced capital gains tax which is essentially a tax on wealth and is fair under our progressive tax system i e the greater your means are the more tax you pay that nicely illustrates the traditional difference between the parties as far as their views on social welfare and equity are concerned  Flat tax John Howard Tax Progressive tax Taxation in the United States Democracy Microeconomics Supply-side economics Goods and Services Tax (Canada) Liberal Party of Canada Canadian federal election, 1993 Liberal Democrats (UK) Value added tax Democratic Party (United States) Brian Mulroney Capitalism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus United Kingdom corporation tax Social Security debate (United States) FairTax Australian legislative election, 2004 Social democracy Australian Democrats Supply and demand Politics of Canada John Hewson Conservative Party (UK) Social Security (United States) Liberalism Publicly funded medicine Australian Labor Party Goods and Services Tax (Australia) Progress Party (Norway) Taxation in Canada Inflation Poll tax Margaret Thatcher Reaganomics Article One of the United States Constitution Australian constitutional law Left-wing politics Paul Keating Free market Canadian and American politics compared Charles Haughey Local government in the United Kingdom Corporate governance Economic inequality Gross domestic product Joe Clark Regressive tax Property tax Mike Harris Politics of Ontario Voter turnout Protectionism Income tax Quebec general election, 2003 Taxation in the Republic of Ireland History of the United Kingdom Economy of Russia Celtic Tiger Peter Costello Modernization of Sweden Politics of the United States Canadian Senate 39th Canadian federal election Australian electoral system Canadian and American economies compared Surplus value Non-aggression principle Progressive Democrats Free trade Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Alliance (New Zealand political party) Trickle down effect Bob Hawke Labour Party (UK) Politics of the Republic of China Kyoto Protocol Liberal Party (UK) Labour economics Post-Confederation history of Canada Elections in the United Kingdom Libertarianism Tariff Bob Rae

attention all past present xlon tax software users hi i have nearly scored myself a new job that i am very eager to start however the one condition that will keep me from getting this job is that i have never used xlon tax before i currently use handisoft i would like to know your opinions on xlon is it fairly user friendly and do you think the basics could be picked up fairly quickly does anyone know if there is a demo vresion i can download from somewhere i used the predecessor of this version years ago called xlon ceedata and it was my favourite tax software to use very user friendly and easy to navigate i also used solution which was the most annoying clunky dinosaur tax software i ever used i think solution took over xlon and this is the product you have now if it's based on ceedata then it should be nice to use you may be able to get a demo from solution so google them but really if you've used handitax and know your way around a tax return then with a little computer savvy it's not going to take you very long to get the hang of other tax software they're all based on the same tax return forms tax staff are hard to find so i'm sure the employer will be happy if you say you know handitax and are confident as a quick learner to use xlon i've never had any trouble learning new tax software and currently use elite which is the best in my opinion if this job doesn't work out and you're in sydney then contact me i might need you  HyperCard Computer virus System/36 Commodore 64 OpenOffice.org Linux Expert system Extreme Programming Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Common Unix Printing System Mach kernel Microsoft GNU General Public License BASIC programming language Windows XP Enterprise content management Outsourcing Microsoft Windows IPod Machinima BitTorrent Wiki Mozilla Firefox Common criticisms of Microsoft Copy protection Mac OS X v10.4 Database management system Game programming System 7 (Macintosh) GIF AmigaOS Software engineering Apple Macintosh Software testing Bluetooth Genetic algorithm IBM PC compatible Mouse (computing) Gross domestic product Object Desktop Intuit, Inc.
