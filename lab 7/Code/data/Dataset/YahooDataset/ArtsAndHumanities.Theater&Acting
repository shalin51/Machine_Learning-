about agents okay i've been reading other peoples questions and i see that most of the answers for getting out there in the acting world and gaining auditions so forth and so on call for agents i was wondering what was the price range on agents and such and i know certian commercials or what not hold open casting calls but can you imagine how hard it is when you're not even eighteen yet and you live in north carolina nothing much happens here sorry 'bout useless rambling lol but yeah any comments on average costs for agents and what i should do since i live in a state that barely knows what the word industry means there are no aftra sag franchised or non sag franchised agents in the state of north carolina so now what all i really need to know is how to go about finding a suitable agent or something and so are you saying that if they charge you to represent you it's a scam are you kidding are you anywhere near wilmington one tree hill is filmed there as was dawson's creek according to wikipedia over film tv productions have been shot in the area the largest sound stage outside of hollywood is built there check out the nc film office website i have no idea how big nc is so it may not be possible for you to get to wilmington but if it is then check out agencies there you could probably at lest get some extra work if you're not near there then you're right there probably aren't many agencies in your area b c there's probably not a lot of demand in that case if you want to act check out your local theatres your high school even churches even if you're in a small town there should at least be some opportunities also no you don't pay agents they take a percentage of your earnings so they only get paid when you get paid secondly outside of ny and la you don't necessarily need an agent to get you work in dc we have very few agencies most of the offices are casting directors so you get rid of the middle man essentially they still take a percentage of your earnings though but you don't have to sign an exclusive contract  Screen Actors Guild Modelling agency Katie Holmes Microeconomics Film Real estate broker Plame affair Insurance Hollywood, Los Angeles, California Contract Advertising Screenplay Citigroup FairTax Mutual fund National Kidney Foundation Singapore One Tree Hill (TV series) Supply and demand North Carolina Bond Natural monopoly Principal-agent problem Home Box Office Unreformed House of Commons Advance fee fraud Screenwriting Publishing Marlon Brando Public domain Canadian House of Commons RKO Pictures National Football League ITV Taxation in the United States Tax Child support Lawyer Filmmaking Confidence trick CPU cache Boston and Lowell Railroad Xerox Paul Is Dead Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Reparations for slavery November (film) Airline Unemployment Theatre Humphrey Bogart Merit Credit card Karl Rove University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Education in the United States Education Wall Street Public transport Article One of the United States Constitution Raleigh, North Carolina The Apprentice 2 Minimum wage Primerica Financial Services Estoppel Cinema of Canada Trademark Secretar__a de Inteligencia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Paintball Boston Red Sox Casting (performing arts) Inflation Major League Baseball television contracts Altruism Avenue Q Movie studio Dawson Creek, British Columbia Value added tax Poker jargon Kasparov versus The World United States Postal Service The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Whose Line Is It Anyway?

i seem to forget my lines on stage is it memorization or stage fright i have done a couple of monologues and duets yet it seems like every time i blank out on stage i do take some time to memorize my lines but just briefly i'm not sure if its stage fright or i need to take more time on memorizing what do you all face simple stacking method to remember your lines first use a pencil or word processor and write down or type each page of the script you can also do several pages at a time as opposed to the entire script take the page into a quiet room shut the door and eliminate all distractions look at the first line in your notes and read it out loud then close your eyes and say the line without looking at it repeat the step above this time with the first lines next try it with lines then repeat until you have memorized every line in the script sides after a study session take a quick nap new memories are very vulnerable but studies have shown that sleep helps your new memories stick after your nap repeat the memory technique once more for maximum retention  Sleep Compiler optimization Traditional animation CPU design RISC Lucid dreaming Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Mnemonic Arabic alphabet PaX Memory Cross site scripting Forth programming language Writing Musical mode CPU cache Glossary of partner dance terms Marching band Whose Line Is It Anyway?

how do u become an actress one of the biggest difficulties faced by those of us who decide to become professional actors is a large group of folks i call the bad advice crowd the bad advice crowd bacs are a diverse group which includes smart alecks wise guys nay sayers fear mongers cynics gossips fact checkers dummies failures rumor repeaters experts and even those poor souls who are worried about what other people will think a bac becomes a bac because a bac is unable to see the reality of any situation generally this happens because the bac is so wrapped up in his own vision of how things are or how things should be that he cannot see the truth please take my word for it you will encounter many bacs in your quest for professional acting success the first group of bacs you will encounter are a little surprising people in your family moms dads sisters brothers second cousins and maiden aunts can assault you with their fears concerns and prejudices they will do this because you have decided to go off the beaten path and they are worried about you this is cathy she s our actress is the least debilitating of these sorts of comments some others include acting how will you make a living that s not the sort of thing people like us do what makes you think you can act my goodness you ve got to stop dreaming and get a decent job who told you that you could do that the second group of bacs are surprising and a llittle sad other actors that's right people just like you will also rain on your parade the odd part is that most of them will actually be in circumstances much like your own these are people who are in the same boat with you telling you how to get out of the boat think about it the comments suggestions and advice you get from these kinds of actors is literally unbelievable if they knew as much as they purport to know well they wouldn t be there in the boat with you would they this is a dog eat dog business is something you will hear from other actors a lot if you don t have the look you don t stand a chance this town is only interested in who you know your type doesn t get much work you ve got to spend a fortune on headshots or they won t work without an agent you re dead in the water don t do extra work they won t give you parts if you do that they only hire their friends if you want to make it you ve got to be willing to do anything a lot of people date their way to the top there are many more comments in this category but i think you get the gist in fact what they are really doing is raining on their own parade don't listen they're talking to themselves and you need to stay far away from people like that all of these so called statements of fact are utter hogwash the third and most dangerous group of bacs are composed of agents managers casting directors producers and other executives these people can have a devastating effect on your career with just a word or two if you listen i don t think you have what it takes you re not movie star material you have no talent why are you wasting your time you need my help i can get you to the top if you sleep with me i ll see to it that you get that part there are millions of wannabes what makes you any different if you want to make it you ve got to be willing to compromise your values now will you date me the fourth bac well i ll get to that one in a minute the downside of the bad advice crowd is this they are ruinous to your attitude why is your attitude important because attitude 'mind set' is the secret weapon of successful people i was watching the biography channel yesterday and mike meyers talked about his secret of success i just wouldn t give up no matter what i would just keep doing it this is the attitude the mind set of practically every professional actor i ve ever met or read about you cannot allow anyone to chip away at this attitude with their bad advice no doubt you love your family but don t listen if they don t support you if they do support you then listen carefully they may give you very good advice as far as other struggling actors giving you good advice let s just say that s about as likely as paulie shore winning an oscar most of the time when you hear smart actors talking about the rules and the way things are you are hearing an excuse they are making up for later their chatter is a rehearsal for the eventual explanation they will give for their own failure to achieve their goals it s a crap shoot you gotta get the breaks it s so competitive and i m just not a competitive sort of person i just won t sleep around to get ahead it s not easy to hear someone in a position of authority tell you that you should go back to omaha because you just don t have it there are going to be people like this in your life it s a guarantee how do i know this because of people like harrison ford julia roberts denzel washington clint eastwood lucille ball and ray romano all these actors and thousands of others probably every last man jack of us have been told they didn t stand a chance many were fired for being without talent or too ugly or too much like someone else almost all were turned down by agents managers producers and executives a group who have proven over the years that they cannot see a movie star in the making any more than they can see subatomic quarks colliding with protons with their naked eye the great writer william goldman put it best nobody knows you are going to hear this stuff you must ignore it think about it if you are being told that your dream is not worthy this is very bad information your dream is what your life is all about people who do what they love without any thought of giving up are the most astounding successes in our little world period love it and don t give up those are the real rules of success please listen closely you must ignore these people in your life they are everywhere and they never shut up so you have to learn to ignore them can you do it of course you can you are able to ignore anything you choose to ignore like traffic elevator music or aol cd's in your mail box you do it every day now apply your skill to all this baloon juice you get from other people it s an exercise how can you ignore all these people and still be a nice person don t hang with them who you hang out with will have an astounding effect on your outcome if you hang with a group of idle less than ambitious people with excuses for the lack of forward progress it will cost you if you like these people or even love them they will have a negative effect on your mind set by the same token if the people in your crowd talk about their own dreams of success becoming professional actors getting to the top making it etc then you will find it easier to stay focused on your own goals love your family but ignore them on this issue if they aren t supporters of your dream choose your friends carefully those who support your dream are going to help you those that scoff or question or present you with the facts are going to hold you back in work situations you will not have the choice about your associates but you do have a choice about whether to listen to them or not it s just that simple make up your mind which is why it s called a mind set to only 'take in' the advice that will help you learn to tell the difference ignore the bacs just like you ignore cable access shows about accounting you can do it oh that fourth bac well it's not really a crowd unless you are a multiple personality that's right it's you you have to keep an eye on yourself and the things you say to yourself if you repeat the kinds of things we've been talking about to other less experienced actors you are rehearsing your own excuse don't do that if you are constantly looking for 'reasons' that things aren't working out for you it's rehearsal again don't do it if you are negative about your skills your looks your finances your lack of contacts your lack of an agent etc it will cost you big time in fact it will cost you the very thing you desire so if you want to succeed get into the right 'mind set' and stay there positive messages in positive results out that s my input ps isn't it interesting how the guy below me just cut and pasted my answer before i spaced it out a bit what a fool  Hey Jude Roxette Goodness and value theory Intelligent design Jon Secada

i am auditioning for guys and dolls and i need some general acting dance and voice tips to get a good part i've been in plays before so i have the basics down i really want the part of sky masterson so how should i mold my character i am actually in a production of guys and dolls right now i play sarah brown so i'm pretty familiar with sky's character since he's sarah's romantic lead in the show your best bet would be to watch the movie and see how brando does the role very suave and debonair very confident in himself maybe even a little cocky it isn't until he falls in love with sarah that he becomes unsure of himself and much more likeable sky is like a big football jock at the high school not afraid to make big crazy bets well known by all the other gamblers in new york and claims he can get any doll he wants however you should probably make sure not to overdo the role the actor playing sky in the production i'm in does a very good job drawing the line between a believable character and a caricature the difference a caricature more or less is making fun of a stereotype instead of being a believable character if you're not much of a singer don't worry about it sky's songs are fairly easy and if a sarah is cast with a strong voice it'll be even easier as most of sky's songs are duets not much dancing is involved with sky's role either there's a little dancing when sky and sarah go to havana and a little bit of dancing in sky's big music number luck be a lady tonight other than that the role is fairly simple no matter what part you end up getting guys and dolls is one of the most fun musicals i've ever been a part of and you're sure to have fun too just remember not to overdo it and it should all be smooth sailing have fun and break a leg  Marlon Brando Rod Stewart Cliff Richard Jon Secada Whitney Houston Jennifer Lopez Sarah Jessica Parker Kodocha The Fairly OddParents Janet Jackson Poker jargon Aerial (dance move) Craps Cyndi Lauper Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In Actor David Bowie Spice Girls Eric Cartman Ed, Edd n Eddy Sinfest AFI 100 Years series Recurring South Park characters Ray Winstone Britney Spears The Jazz Singer Can't Hardly Wait The O.C.

are there any movies casting currently it is my dream to become an actress does anyone know if there are casting agencies looking for unknowns for any young roles any info would be great it doesn't sound like you are ready by any means to be a professional actress otherwise you most certainly would not be asking this question however anyone can be an extra in film and television unlike actors extras do not have agents who take a percent commission you simply register with extras casting companies and call in each day on their casting lines to get work unless you hire a booking service for about a month to call in and get you the work of course these calling or booking services really do not call in to get you the work they simply know people at the extras casting companies and get lists of what they need and act as sub casting agents think about it why would the extras casting company individually call each and every person when they can just call a booking service and say we need people for a party scene then the booking service does all the work and calls each of their clients themselves sag is trying to regulate these companies at some point but the fact remains that these services can get you much more work than you can on your own just calling in on the casting lines all day trying to get through the busy signals the screen actors guild does have jurisdiction over backround actors however the contracts only require a small number of union extras to be hired for a given union production and the rest of the extras are non union this is part of the contract that production companies sign with the union there is a publication called extra work for brain surgeons it truly is the bible of extra work i am not one to try to sell books for anyone but i am in the know about this subject central casting in the biggest extras casting company followed by bill dance casting you simply register with these places and then you work there is a huge amount of work for non union extras and just a small amount of union extra work as a matter of fact one can work every day as a non union extra but if you are a sag member it is much harder to get union extra jobs this is because a given tv show for example only has to hire union extras and the rest can be non union if you sign up with a booking service or calling service as they like to call themselves you can literally work every day but the pay is not much more than minimum wage for non union although overtime is usually the norm as well as wardrobe allowance and sometimes mileage allowance you also can get paid extra for using your car pet or props in a scene there are many sag members secretly doing non union extra work simply because there just is not enough union extra jobs to go around you must live in la of course get a thomas guide map book and have a cell phone and a car but if you do your homework you literally can work every day no matter your experience or looks you can be young or old tall or short overweight or underweight some one armed dude or whatever there is plenty of work to go around and hollywood needs all types of people you don't even need headshots or a resume they take a digital photo when you register with all of those extras casting companies just stick with the legit companies there is a nominal or so fee to register even sag member have to pay a photo fee to register so there it is don't take bad advice just register with the big extras casting companies and follow the rules of working as a fim tv extra as i said i am not out to sell that book you can do some research and find out all you need but be careful as there are tons of bottom feeders scamming people who want to work in film tv as extras if you are lucky you can even become sag eligible from doing non union extra work but that is a whole other long story here is a link to hollywoodos the company that publishes that book extra work for brain surgeons http hollywoodos com index php option com content task blogcategory id itemid peace out alan ps aftra american federation of television and radio artists has jurisdiction over soaps and sitcoms among other videotaped and radio broadcast productions this is a whole different story and anyone can walk into aftra and join for about  Screen Actors Guild Insurance Whose Line Is It Anyway?

best agentcies in los angeles hi i want to start an acting modeling or acting singing career were is the best agency in los angeles i have the money to pay for it and i've taken lessons for all three for a couple of years thanks bye there isn't really such a thing as a best agency it depends on your age experience attitude type and many other factors talent agents for actors come in two main types theatrical television and film and commercial for commercials there are also dance print and voice over agents who specialize in these fields and signing with one of these agents can be a great way for actors with these other skills to cross over into one of the other areas being with the same agency for everything is called being signed across the board but many actors prefer to have separate agents for different types of work become some agencies might be strong commercially but not as strong theatrically or vice versa agents get information about auditions for roles either directly from casting directors and producers calling them asking for client submissions or from a fax email service called the breakdowns a daily list of roles being cast sent only to agents and managers although there is a black market for this information within the acting community and many actors without representation self submit for available roles which some casting people don't mind others hate and the owner of breakdown services abhors remember actors your agents work for you but they only get of what you make so that means you need to do of the work especially when you are getting started that means always be professional know your craft don't shy away from networking and letting cd producers and directors know about your accomplishments upcoming appearances by sending out postcards know your type and how you fit into the current market and above all make sure you and your agent are on the same page about what kinds of parts you will be submitted for and never pay an agent or manager up front to represent you they only make money when they make you money the plan of attack most agents refuse any off the street drop ins in other words they'll see new talent by appointment only don't bother phoning in for one just yet because without a face you're just another voice and unless that voice is absolutely incredible and the agent handles a lot of voice over work it simply won't get you in instead mail off your photo and resume along with a very special cover letter what makes that letter so special simple prove that you understand how valuable their time is so many people try cramming in their whole hopes and dreams autobiography into the cover letter it resembles a chapter from a novel the agent hasn't the time nor the interest to be a publisher any submission that takes more than seconds to scan through and read will likely be filed in the trash here's a sample of how to keep it short wannabe talent hopeful avenue dreamland bc attn ms a gent please accept my photos and resume for possible consideration of future representation i will contact your offices next week to verify your receipt of this package thank you very much for your time johnny smartguy that's it nothing else just plain and simple the agent even has seconds left to take a quick glance at your photo s and stats now the big trick comes the following week give it a full week before calling in and try to make the call on a tuesday or wednesday when they may be less frantic in the office just call up and say hi my name's johnny smartguy and i'm just calling to confirm you received my photo and resume chances are you'll get a response of the agents will be looking at it or there are no openings right now try back in a few months or even the infamous the agents will call you back if they're interested whatever the response simply answer no problem i don't want to take up your time i just promised i would make sure the package got there okay i don't want to keep you thank you very much for your time pause they'll either be impressed and relieved at the short conversation or they'll be caught so off guard that they'll try to explain further if they haven't said goodbye then just repeat a variation of your previous words always offering them the opportunity to end the conversation and reinforcing that you know their time is valuable they're so used to the can i come in pleading that you've really thrown them for a loop by not asking them for something call the better business bureau to see if any complaints have been made against the agency tips warnings agents making their living by earning a percentage of each job they book for a model do not pay any up front fees to an agent if you're not happy with the number of auditions or bookings you are getting set up an appointment with your agent and discuss what you can do to generate more jobs if the agent lies to you makes outrageous promises or asks for up front money to cover phone calls or mailing expenses on your behalf keep looking legitimate agents do not ask for expense money go to the website link below it is the screen actors guild agent list for both sag franchised and non franchised

how do i get an agent if you have one plz tell me how you got one i really need an agent ive tooken classes and im really serious about acting talent agents for actors come in two main types theatrical television and film and commercial for commercials there are also dance print and voice over agents who specialize in these fields and signing with one of these agents can be a great way for actors with these other skills to cross over into one of the other areas being with the same agency for everything is called being signed across the board but many actors prefer to have separate agents for different types of work become some agencies might be strong commercially but not as strong theatrically or vice versa agents get information about auditions for roles either directly from casting directors and producers calling them asking for client submissions or from a fax email service called the breakdowns a daily list of roles being cast sent only to agents and managers although there is a black market for this information within the acting community and many actors without representation self submit for available roles which some casting people don't mind others hate and the owner of breakdown services abhors remember actors your agents work for you but they only get of what you make so that means you need to do of the work especially when you are getting started that means always be professional know your craft don't shy away from networking and letting cd producers and directors know about your accomplishments upcoming appearances by sending out postcards know your type and how you fit into the current market and above all make sure you and your agent are on the same page about what kinds of parts you will be submitted for and never pay an agent or manager up front to represent you they only make money when they make you money the plan of attack most agents refuse any off the street drop ins in other words they'll see new talent by appointment only don't bother phoning in for one just yet because without a face you're just another voice and unless that voice is absolutely incredible and the agent handles a lot of voice over work it simply won't get you in instead mail off your photo and resume along with a very special cover letter what makes that letter so special simple prove that you understand how valuable their time is so many people try cramming in their whole hopes and dreams autobiography into the cover letter it resembles a chapter from a novel the agent hasn't the time nor the interest to be a publisher any submission that takes more than seconds to scan through and read will likely be filed in the trash here's a sample of how to keep it short wannabe talent hopeful avenue dreamland bc attn ms a gent please accept my photos and resume for possible consideration of future representation i will contact your offices next week to verify your receipt of this package thank you very much for your time johnny smartguy that's it nothing else just plain and simple the agent even has seconds left to take a quick glance at your photo s and stats now the big trick comes the following week give it a full week before calling in and try to make the call on a tuesday or wednesday when they may be less frantic in the office just call up and say hi my name's johnny smartguy and i'm just calling to confirm you received my photo and resume chances are you'll get a response of the agents will be looking at it or there are no openings right now try back in a few months or even the infamous the agents will call you back if they're interested whatever the response simply answer no problem i don't want to take up your time i just promised i would make sure the package got there okay i don't want to keep you thank you very much for your time pause they'll either be impressed and relieved at the short conversation or they'll be caught so off guard that they'll try to explain further if they haven't said goodbye then just repeat a variation of your previous words always offering them the opportunity to end the conversation and reinforcing that you know their time is valuable they're so used to the can i come in pleading that you've really thrown them for a loop by not asking them for something call the better business bureau to see if any complaints have been made against the agency tips warnings agents making their living by earning a percentage of each job they book for a model do not pay any up front fees to an agent if you're not happy with the number of auditions or bookings you are getting set up an appointment with your agent and discuss what you can do to generate more jobs if the agent lies to you makes outrageous promises or asks for up front money to cover phone calls or mailing

i have a interview with a talent agent does anybody have any tips for me this is my first interview and i don't even have a headshot how did you get the interview just curious yes as long as they don't want you to pay them a dime up front for anything or want you to go to a specific photographer or take specific classes workshops i couldn't even work as a backround actor on a soap without a photo and resume when i started out i was with a friend who was auditioning for general hospital and i helped his read lines before he went in to read for the head casting director then the associate casting director asked me if i was an actor then he said to send in a headshot and resume even showed me a sample and then they put me to work as an extra only after i sent in the headshot and resume although my resume was blank lol just my name contact and special skills like bowling and motorcycle riding lol anyways here is a good article meeting with a talent agent by tony martinez talent agent congratulations you did it you managed to get my attention and i've agreed to take a meeting that means you get one shot to convince me that my career as an agent cannot continue unless your name is on my list the process is simple first i always meet one on one with potential clients this gives me a chance to really get to know the person if that goes well i ask the actor to come back and meet the other agents it's essential that everyone be in agreement one agent should never try to convince the others to sign someone and that's basically it the only problem is actors tend to be their own worst enemy believe it or not actors seeking representation are always convincing me not to sign them pretty depressing right i'm always amazed by how much effort actors put into getting a meeting with me but none of you ever know how to behave once you're actually in my office before we tackle this subject let's make something clear i want to like you it's my job to sign actors and if you're sitting in my office that means you did something right maybe i noticed your submission maybe someone referred you or maybe i saw your work in a showcase whatever it was something positive happened to get your butt into that chair so don't turn a positive into a negative you've got minutes to make an impression that's seconds you have to use that time wisely so how should you behave in my office well think of it this way meeting with an agent is like a first date you've got two people in a room they're sizing each other up and they're both wondering if it's going to go any further now ask yourself this what's the worst thing you can do on a first date answer talk about yourself there's nothing worse than being stuck on a date with someone who spends the whole night going on and on about themselves it's the same thing in a meeting i tend to tune out actors who waste their time by doing a non stop monologue about who they are and what they want so don't play into the stereotype of the narcissistic self involved actor it's dull it's boring and worst of all it doesn't give me a chance to really get to know you instead walk into that office and create an atmosphere where you can both get to know each other as people i have to forget that you're an actor seeking representation that's boring instead i need to see you as an individual i have to get a sense of who you really are outside the world of show business how do you do this easy try to have a normal conversation maybe there's something in my office that catches your eye or maybe you just saw a great movie whatever the idea is to get into a give and take situation where you're talking about anything but acting this will give me a chance to get to know the real you i once met with a young lady who had tarot card reader listed on her resume under special skills it just so happens that i love anything having to do with the occult so we started talking about it and the next thing you know we're both sitting on the floor and she's giving me a reading as a result we really got to know each other and i ended up representing her for many years now that's what i call a good meeting remember it's easy for an agent to pass on an actor seeking representation we do it every day but saying no becomes just a little bit harder when we've spent minutes getting to know you as a human being and that might just be enough to get you signed as a client  Milton H.

i have a question for people skilled in theatre and concert lighting i went to a concert for the first time since i was last night and was really intrigued by the lighting i am the tech director in my highschool's drama club so i recognized most of the lights used as pars but they were using another type of light that i did not recognize they were hanging moving lights that shot out focused beams there were also some on the floor of the stage that had less focused beams i don't think that they are really used in theatre lighting probably just in concerts i was just wondering if anyone knew what these were called i'm a complete techie and i like to know as much as possible thanks they are no doubt various kinds of ellipsoidal and fresnel spotlights in today's lighting the spotlights have remotely controlled motors which allow them to be refocused in use some also have color changing ability they are used both in concerts and theatrical productions but few schools have them due to the great expense  Stage lighting Lighting Theatre Film Ellipsoidal Solar power Carnegie Mellon University Headlight Speed of light Lens (optics) Theater (structure) Lighting designer Drama Irish theatre Traffic light Fresnel lens Universal Century Technology Cliff Richard Super Metroid King George V School Sydney Opera House Puppet Light Milton H.

acting audtions my sister is a big name actress but i can't tell you who for personal reason and whenever i go to movie auditions they never treat me like i am my own person they don't understand that i am not my sister can you give me some tips on what to do ha my sister and i are not famous but the same thing happens to us it is because your sister has left a bigger impression than you have the only way to fix this is to be famous in your own life whatever you do do it well make friends when your sister's people meet you for the first time they only have your sister to compare you to talk a while and let them get to know you but remember in your sis's world that things are different than in yours if you are not famous don't expect strangers to recognize you i wouldn't suggest being an actress to try to be equal to your sis in popularity unless that is what you want to do for a career choose your own road and be famous with the people on your road good luck to you  Theory of conduct Polyamory Social rule The nature of God in Western theology Scouting Sexual orientation Friends Actor Utilitarianism Kodocha Asha Bhosle Betting (poker) Poker jargon Sharon Tate Hilary Duff Cliff Richard Nicomachean Ethics Humphrey Bogart Kim Philby Milton H.

i have read and seen much ado about nothing its theme is more complex than love lies and denial any ideas i saw the play tonight tomorrow at two p m is the final performance at csueastbay in hayward and it was so real i have read the play previous to this in a shakespeare class so i know the storyline and characters well what i need help with is the theme not the story what is it really about it is more than denial andfinding true love it is more than plotting against purity isn't it what do you think that the underlying theme is of this play i read a comment which was posted monthes ago that mentioned the idea of nothingness hence the title what do you think thanks for considering this and responding the title of 'much ado' is interesting because it seems to work as a pun on several levels firstly the play is itself 'a lot of fuss about nothing' hero wasn't unfaithful beatrice and benedick don't really hate each other all the characters' problems could be resolved really simply it's just that human beings are complicated and perverse and never want what's best for them another meaning is based on the fact that at the time when shakespeare was writing the word 'nothing' was pronounced a lot like the word 'noting' so the play is much ado about noting about people listening in on each other's conversations spying and overhearing stuff that they shouldn't the third meaning is then based on the fact that a woman's vagina was often referred to as 'nothing' at the time because it couldn't be seen easily and so 'didn't exist' unlike the male penis therefore the play is also 'a lot of fuss about women's private parts' another theme is control of women and possession of them the power struggle between what men want and what women want and the role of human sexuality in all this in terms of themes in general there are therefore lots of things to talk about the battle between the sexes the way in which love and desire is irrational with people not wanting what is best for them the fact that love and hatred are often very closely connected etc etc there isn't just one thing that the play is about it's a complex work of art which raises numerous different issues and ideas  Much Ado About Nothing Human sexual behavior Deconstruction Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Plame affair Homophobia EastEnders Shaggy dog story Sex Iago George Costanza Theory of conduct Theodicy Isaac Asimov Androgen insensitivity syndrome Shakespeare on screen Fight Club Extreme Programming Free will Oral sex Infidels Gender-neutral language Avenue Q Objectivist philosophy Human Brave New World Goodness and value theory Drama Hiberno-English Sexual intercourse Tl__n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius Christopher Marlowe Predestination Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Effeminacy Sex and the City God Emperor of Dune Sant Thakar Singh Charmed The Catcher in the Rye Sharon Tate Zoophilia Capitalism Days of our Lives Meaning of life Sexual orientation Social rule Transsexuality Philosophy of language YuYu Hakusho Drawn Together Intersex surgery The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Penis envy The nature of God in Western theology Tao Te Ching Abortion debate The Merchant of Venice Gender role Sodom and Gomorrah Shakespeare's reputation Blackadder Shakespearean authorship Empire Burlesque Sigmund Freud Ten Commandments Carlos Castaneda Homosexuality and transgender Gender Nihilism Something Positive Identity Crisis (comics) Atheism Bat Lash The Apprentice 2 David Hume I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Daredevil Epistemology FLCL Homosexuality and Christianity Friends Culture of Lithuania Humphrey Bogart The Chronicles of Narnia Summa Theologiae House of Leaves XML Yoko Ono Paradox Three Laws of Robotics Storytelling Ex-gay

how do you start an year old acting career i really want to start acting i was wonderng if anyone new anyting about being and extra or in a commercial or something anyone can be an extra in film and television unlike actors extras do not have agents who take a percent commission you simply register with extras casting companies and call in each day on their casting lines to get work unless you hire a booking service for about a month to call in and get you the work of course these calling or booking services really do not call in to get you the work they simply know people at the extras casting companies and get lists of what they need and act as sub casting agents think about it why would the extras casting company individually call each and every person when they can just call a booking service and say we need people for a party scene then the booking service does all the work and calls each of their clients themselves sag is trying to regulate these companies at some point but the fact remains that these services can get you much more work than you can on your own just calling in on the casting lines all day trying to get through the busy signals the screen actors guild does have jurisdiction over backround actors however the contracts only require a small number of union extras to be hired for a given union production and the rest of the extras are non union this is part of the contract that production companies sign with the union there is a publication called extra work for brain surgeons it truly is the bible of extra work i am not one to try to sell books for anyone but i am in the know about this subject central casting in the biggest extras casting company followed by bill dance casting you simply register with these places and then you work there is a huge amount of work for non union extras and just a small amount of union extra work as a matter of fact one can work every day as a non union extra but if you are a sag member it is much harder to get union extra jobs this is because a given tv show for example only has to hire union extras and the rest can be non union if you sign up with a booking service or calling service as they like to call themselves you can literally work every day but the pay is not much more than minimum wage for non union although overtime is usually the norm as well as wardrobe allowance and sometimes mileage allowance you also can get paid extra for using your car pet or props in a scene there are many sag members secretly doing non union extra work simply because there just is not enough union extra jobs to go around you must live in la of course get a thomas guide map book and have a cell phone and a car but if you do your homework you literally can work every day no matter your experience or looks you can be young or old tall or short overweight or underweight some one armed dude or whatever there is plenty of work to go around and hollywood needs all types of people you don't even need headshots or a resume they take a digital photo when you register with all of those extras casting companies just stick with the legit companies there is a nominal or so fee to register even sag member have to pay a photo fee to register so there it is don't take bad advice just register with the big extras casting companies and follow the rules of working as a fim tv extra as i said i am not out to sell that book you can do some research and find out all you need but be careful as there are tons of bottom feeders scamming people who want to work in film tv as extras if you are lucky you can even become sag eligible from doing non union extra work but that is a whole other long story here is a link to hollywoodos the company that publishes that book extra work for brain surgeons http hollywoodos com index php option com content task blogcategory id itemid peace out alan ps aftra american federation of television and radio artists has jurisdiction over soaps and sitcoms among other videotaped and radio broadcast productions this is a whole different story and anyone can walk into aftra and join for about  Screen Actors Guild Insurance Cable television ITV Whose Line Is It Anyway?

do you know any us acting agents who also take on people from the uk please help me the us websites seem more helpful than the uk websites i believe some will but you'll need to be able to come out to the us for an interview and then for auditions so it's going to be hugely inconvenient and expensive also you will need various forms to work over there although i think that's provided when you get a job so the short answer is no you should look for a uk agent first maybe when you have an established uk agent and some credits they will hook you up with someone in the us if that's what you want like established british actors who start working over there i would say exhaust your local market first  Call centre Real estate broker Financial audit Modelling agency Dwarfism Offshoring Voice actor Licence to Kill 24 (television) Charmed Predictive dialer Britpop Outsourcing Stamp Act 1765 Bretton Woods system Student loan Sleeper agent Insurance Whose Line Is It Anyway?

i'm years old i wanna be an actor because it's my dream to be how can i get this or how can i enter almost every working actor today has completed a college degree the tiny percentage that didn't almost always became famous doing something else modeling athletics comedy hip hop first your first step toward your career is to earn a bachelor of fine arts bfa degree from the best university program you can manage since i don't know where you are educationally i'll try to address both possibilities if you are already out of high school then it's too late to get in to one this year so go to your local community college and take general education courses hoping that you'll be able to transfer them and save yourself from losing a year now if you're currently in high school similar advice applies but you don't want to look at community colleges in the meantime do as much theatre as you can audition for roles in school plays not only your own but other nearby colleges and universities if they hold open auditions also volunteer to help backstage or in front of the house professional actors today not only know acting they understand all aspects of theatre lighting props sets costume make up ticket sales house management directing stage management etc etc etc immediately start looking for universities that offer a bachelor of fine arts bfa degree in theatre your high school counselor or community college career development office can help also ask every contact that you have in school or community theatre you should identify three or four schools that you will apply to or that are a real challenge to get into tip top programs like yale that will probably accept you a good state university maybe and that accepts everybody that's your safety net get your applications in pronto many of the programs will require that you be accepted as a student at the university and then will require another application and auditions before they accept you as a theatre major if you don't get into the theatre program they try to get you to major in something else there like accounting or nuclear physics that's why you have a back up plan so it's essential to have your university acceptances this fall if you want to start your theatre degree in fall early admissions also will put you earlier in line for more types of financial aid the bfa program should give you all of the training and knowledge to become a working professional actor eventually many of the finer ones even include instruction in such niceties as how to navigate the subway system in new york city so get into a good fully accredited bfa program and you'll have the best shot at your dream  Education in the United States Community college Juris Doctor Law school Graduate school Associate's degree Software engineering Master's degree Education in Portugal Medical school College admissions College Physician University of Central Florida Lawyer Architect Education in the People's Republic of China Florida State University California Polytechnic State University Seneca College Athabasca University Nurse Chinese University of Hong Kong Academic degree Florida Institute of Technology Education University of Michigan University of Notre Dame Trinity College, Dublin Master of Business Administration Physical therapy Georgetown University Kwantlen University College University of Connecticut American University Bachelor of Arts City and Guilds of London Institute Paralegal Far Eastern University Northeastern University, Boston Degrees of Oxford University Dentistry Oregon State University York University Theatre Education in Romania Advanced Placement Program Education in Sweden Columbia University Student loan Education in the Republic of Ireland Johns Hopkins University Scientology beliefs and practices University of Southern California Heidelberg College Information Technology Infrastructure Library Yale University Education in Taiwan Baruch College University of Santo Tomas University of San Francisco Middle Tennessee State University Purdue University Washington University in St. Louis School counselor Quizbowl Education in Japan Domain Name System University of Bristol Virginia Military Institute University of British Columbia Bilkent University Caldwell College Scholarship University of Alabama Ivy League University of Hawaii at Manoa Pennsylvania State University Cooper Union Education in Malaysia High school ISO 9000 Object-oriented programming Bologna process A-level Temple University Librarian

im and i wanna start acting how do i go about this most of the people who ask questions about getting started in acting on television and in the cinema are fans of the shows they want to work on and there is nothing wrong with that but you need to realize that being a fan dose not mean that you should be an employee of the show too many people have the idea that they are going to go to an open casting call wow the casting director and get a spot on their favorite show honestly your chances are probably better at winning the lottery than this scenario ever happening there is no magic formula to follow that guarantees you success if there is this business wouldn t be this hard to get into to but what i can show you is the path to start on if you really want to make a go of this as a career you have to figure out if acting is really what you want to do or if you only want to do it because you are a fan of a particular show or movie or if it s a passing trend would you be just as happy if no one outside of your community knew who you were but you got to act every week at the local theatre or are you after the money fame and celebrity status that might come your way if your answer has anything to do with the second option stop right now and find another line of work start getting training you can take classes in your school all the way through college or if your town offers a professional acting class all the better you have no idea how many people say i love acting and i know i could be great but i have no training and i ve never acted before that s like asking an airline to make you a pilot but you don t know how to fly a plane obviously foolish start with local plays and build your experience any actor worth their trade will tell you that you never stop training read read read read books not only on the art of acting but also the business of acting as well you re never to young to arm yourself with information concerning the business and how it really works later in life if this becomes your profession the information you ve gained will be invaluable you can buy tons of books on line or check out your library once you ve gotten to the point where you ve done the research and got some training you need to get yourself professional headshots and this is going to cost money if you want to be taken seriously as a professional you need professional headshots digital copies from mom s camera ain t gonna cut it nor will photos from your yearbook or glamour shots you will need to find a reputable headshot photographer and hire them to book a session prices usually range anywhere from and up make up artists are extra and will range from dollars extra now you need to get a couple hundred copies made to prepare for your auditions and mailings now a reality check if you want to make a go of this you will need to be in los angeles la is the film and television mecca for entertainment likewise if you wanted to work in theatre you need to be in new york it s just a simple fact that you will need to adjust too how many professional surfers have you ever heard of who spend all their time in iowa after you have your head shots you or your parents need to start submitting to auditions simply put unless you have a very specific look or talent no reputable agent is going to take you on with no experience they need to know that they can sell you and in turn make money if they can t then it s not in their best interest to represent you you can find auditions through on line services such as la casting actor s access and now casting keep in mind that these sites usually charge a monthly fee for their services again this will cost you money up front we never said getting into acting was cheap after you have landed a few jobs you can start to submit to agencies or invite agents to see you in showcases if an agent likes what they see you can structure a deal with them keep in mind that a legit agent will never ask for money up front however they will get at a minimum of your earnings once you ve booked a job tell the agent up front if you have aspirations to work on a certain show of type of film but the reality is you ll have little chance to select the work you go out for initially a good place to start would be the publications put out by wolf press or through http ww sag org so you still want to be an actor actress then you have to be proactive about it do the research find the agents and make the contacts no one is going to do that for you without you paying for it acting as a profession involves long hard hours of training and work possibly thousands of dollars in headshots monthly bill fees and training and that s just to get a chance to audition long answer short get your training read to get yourself informed do plays locally to get experience get your headshots do small parts to build upon to get experience for your resume submit to agents then finally you may have your shot as fun as it sounds and from time to time it is fun acting is still a job you have to respect it and prepare for it just like any other job if you think you can stand in front of a camera repeat a few lines and make millions then stay in school and look for another profession on the other hand if this is really what you want to do and you re willing to make the sacrifice and do the hard work early on we may just see you on the screen

how often to broadway plays recast specifically when will the actors in the major roles in spring awakening be changed i know it depends but what is expected it depends on how long their contracts are and whether the actors and producers decide to renew the contracts or not they'll probably start looking for a new actor a couple months before a current actor's contract is to end and not be renewed so there's time to rehearse the new person before she he has to perform  Broadway theatre Actor Saturday Night Live John Forsythe Red Hot Chili Peppers Minor league baseball Screen Actors Guild The Kinks BMT Canarsie Line Clark Gable WWE Friday Night SmackDown!

feminism in hamlet i'm doing a seminar on feminism within hamlet i'm about to start reading all the parts where gertrude and ophelia are in the scene but does anyone know any starters e g basic ideas about feminism within the play i've googled but it only brings up pay to view essays which aren't much help atm i must qualify everything i am about to say by admitting that i am no great student of hamlet or shakespeare college course performance which is nothing but here are some ideas focus on how polonius interacts with laertes as compared to ophelia she is reified by polonius her chastity a commodity to be bartered hamlet's love for her a bargaining chip meanwhile polonius's p level of discourse with laertes l is heightened in specific the advice scene to thine own self be true advice is a huge theme in general follow the advice p and l give to ophelia o p manipulates his son too but in a way that allows l more dignity than o i think you'd want to focus on the scene where hamlet and ophelia meet after the to be soliloquy the one were claudius and polonius are secretly watching and hamlet does his whole to a nunnery with you spiel certainly the theme of sexual mores and the nature of gender its performance are an important part of the scene and shakespeare's work at large i may be totally off but i found the scene to be about the objectification of women at least in part if thou dost marry says hamlet to o i'll give thee this plague for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape calumny get thee to a nunnery go farewell or if thou wilt needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them to a nunnery go and quickly too farewell women stir passions in men that make them do evil things probably over simplification i am trying to figure out the most important feminist aspect of gertrude it's one of the things that doesn't come right off the page and is left to interpretation in the performance i saw she is played as an over sexed ninny but i really thought that was crappy this is again an oversimplification but i'd look at the double standard without getting into the whole oedipal thing hamlet resents his mother's practicality doing something so politically comfortable something so potentially sexually gratifying i found gert to be doing what she had to in order to survive but just as easily one can interpret her sexual desire for claudius and for this hamlet finds her a traitorous whore i am probably missing something huge but that's what came to mind at first i hope it helps here is a good website there are plenty like it http www shakespeare online com  Shakespeare on screen Ten Commandments Sexual abstinence Macbeth David and Jonathan Mary, the mother of Jesus William Shakespeare Feminism Matthew 5 Medea (play) Sexual orientation Laertes (character) Iago Virgin Mary in Islam Conversion of Dale-Gudbrand Merit King Claudius Shakespeare's reputation Gender role The Lion King Shakespeare's sonnets Tragic hero Economics Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead Objectivist philosophy Homosexuality Reduced Shakespeare Company Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints The Dunciad Tales from the Public Domain Homosexuality and Islam Gender-neutral language Misogyny Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Sexual revolution A Course In Miracles Amidah The Merchant of Venice Jewish ethics Original sin Sola fide The Sound and the Fury Blackadder Profanity Hamlet (1996 film) Shakespearean authorship Israel ben Eliezer Pornography Marriage In Memoriam A.H.H.

what to wear to community theater auditions i am a teenager and i am trying out for a play on august fourth and i just realized i have no idea what to wear i don't want to look like i know nothing about auditions by dressing up too much but i don't want to seem like i rolled out of bed i probably won't get a role because there are very few parts for my age so i wonder if that plays a part in the desicion also if the audition description says cuttings from the play should i have memorized a monolougue too because i didn't just dress comfortably don't let your clothing distract from what you are doing the more you can be at ease the better you'll be able to perform as a director if i see that an actor is too concerned with how he she looks i'm less likely to cast him her because he she may be more difficult to work with wear something that doesn't inhibit movement and isn't necessarily attention getting  Hilary Duff Theatre Little Britain History of the Beatles Theater terms My Life as a Teenage Robot American Idol Humphrey Bogart Elijah Wood Marlon Brando The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) EastEnders Batman Forever The Wall Autism Gender role The Shining (film) Procrastination Saturday Night Live Shaggy dog story Blonde on Blonde Drag (clothing) Clothing Plame affair History of SNL:1980-1985 Aida (musical) Cross-dressing The Star Wars Holiday Special Skirt and dress Strap-on dildo Street-Legal Brave New World Equine conformation Alias (TV series) Bon Jovi Katie Holmes Marching band Saved by the Bell Monty Python Milton H.

is this childrens tv audition spot a scam at the mall i got signed up to audition for acting and they called me a few days ago and now i have a spot to audition this saturday some people on yahoo answers have told me to watch out and thats its probbaly a scam but i saw the same audition advertisment on tv as well so im not sure if its real or not here is the ad i saw on tv http youtube com watch v vm qjac pjw is this a scam or not this looks like a common scam a company who really sells high priced classes advertises auditions for a disney show but in the end they give you the hard sell on their classes for somewhere between they have you audition by reading a short scene or commercial often from a well known product or even a disney show these pages are very easy to obtain or type up yourself watch the show copy the dialogue that's all there is to it they film you on camera and have you go to the next person who will either tell you that you have potential but you need to take their classes or tell you someone will call you if they're interested and they'll always call because they want your money i've heard that they put on the hard sell meaning that often they try to pressure you into paying for several months of these classes by saying that they are only offering this opportunity to so many kids and you're really lucky to be getting this deal and it's only available now blah blah blah if they're so reputable then why do they need you to pay now because they just care about getting your money they prey on kids and parents with stars in their eyes please don't fall for it don't give them any money they don't even say who they are i'll bet it's john robert powers or another company just like them who have been sued over and over again for ripping people off reputable agents do not hunt down new talent at the mall nor do they advertise for them on tv they don't need to because actors are banging down their doors by the thousands every day what you need is to do things the right way not look for ashort cut get sold training at a reputable acting school or theatre make sure your family supports your decision all the way get into theatrical productions work your way up to student films and independents then try to find an agent without handing thousands of dollars over to people who really aren't going to do anything for you and could care less about your dreams and your career if you want to find a legitimate agent to represent you for commercials tv film go to sag org use the dropdown menu on the right labeled 'resources' and choose 'agent information' on the next screen on the left choose 'find a sag franchised agent' and follow the directions you can look up agents all over the us but there are higher concentrations where the work is los angeles ny il fl ga etc another great resource is ross reports especially because they update their info so often but not all of the agents they list are sag and you have to pay for the list that doesn t mean they re not legit but that s why i always tell people to start with the sag list it s free and those agents have signed an agreement to put the actor first www rossreports com if you subscribe to backstage com you can get a combo subscription which can come in handy but can also get quite expensive then you can send the agencies your headshot resume and a cover letter stating that you are seeking representation and wait to see if they call you in for an interview you never call the agencies directly that is a big no no at least it is in la please remember that reputable agents take exactly of your pay after they help you get a job not one cent more and not one cent before anything else is a scam this is strictly for talent agents not modeling agents or talent managers who take different percentages once you have an agent they will get you the auditions but until then you can check out actorsaccess com you can also see if your state has a film alliance commission society or whatever your state calls theirs some have more than one sometimes they post audition information for projects filming locally for theatre and other auditions on backstage you can go to backstage com or www actorsequity com click on casting call if you find the audition on the equity site you still may be able to go as long as their not taking appointments from equity actor's only on backstage com you have to pay to get all of the info but the initial search is free and you may be able to see enough info to find out the rest on your own without paying

why do spring awakening have lyric changes i was watching a video of the song of purple summer and i listened to the actual track off the cd and its totally different lots of changed lines and i was wondering how come that is is it because of the off broadway to broadway transition yes when a show is first being made they record the songs on a workshop or demo cd these are usually slightly different from the finalized broadway versions they might have found a better way to make the show flow or they needed to change a bit for the sake of the plot if you listen to the nytw version of rent workshop it is very different from the show you'd see today  Avenue Q Jim Steinman Vision of Love Bolt Thrower (band) Rent (musical) Boards of Canada The Holy Bible (album) The Wall Empire Burlesque She Loves You Madama Butterfly ABBA Sesame Street Quarashi Weezer Hole (band) Mixtape Chess (musical) Joy Division (band) BMT Canarsie Line Red Hot Chili Peppers Broadway (Manhattan) MBTA buses in South Boston Destiny's Child Tommy Pump It Up The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars Dream Theater Seramyu Silverchair The Ashlee Simpson Show Meat Loaf Real Love (song) Therion (band) Musical theater Smile (album) Linkin Park Jonathan Larson Wonderland (McFly album) Time Out of Mind Spamalot Crazy in Love Candide (operetta) Nirvana (band) Tony Bennett Rodgers and Hammerstein A Day in the Life Wonderful Town Incubus (band) Louie, Louie Jerry Herman Ira Gershwin Chris Rice Porgy and Bess Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys God Save the Queen Push It (Garbage's song) Multitrack recording The Emancipation of Mimi Law & Order The Beatles discography Air (band) The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Blink-182 Missy Elliott Sake The Little Mermaid (film) Shot of Love Pearl Jam WQHT (FM) Independent Subway System Music genre "Weird Al" Yankovic Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat Rent (film) Whose Line Is It Anyway?

acting please reply i've always been interested in acting except i can't find that many auditions close to where i live i'm and turning in a month does anyone have any suggestions on websites i should check that's a rough age to cast unfortunately but not impossible you might try to get involved in shows where the cast is slightly older maybe as a stage hand or production assistant get immersed in what they do how they do it etc call up directors or producers who have numbers out for casting calls and see if they need stage help that kind of experience goes a long way to building relationships as more people get to know you you may have an advantage you'll know who their acting coaches are where they're going to audition next and when a casting director sees you he she will recognize you as a hard worker and smile that is worth gold best advice i can give get to know people in the biz any possible way you can be set crew be construction crew be anything they need you to be and learn anything they are willing to teach you work hard and get a reputation as a good person and a hard worker avoid light crew if you can unless you just plain like it they tend to be a bit more isolated from the action good luck  Filmmaking Sharon Tate Social rule Drama Poker jargon Drill bit Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Scientology beliefs and practices Indian caste system Humphrey Bogart Alias (TV series) Milton H.

how do i start how could i start a career as an actor well not really a career im only but how can i get into movies and commercials and stuff first off let me say that this question is asked almost ever day in one form or another so if this answer doesn t satisfy you feel free to browse through the other million answers already given now that being said this is the reality most of the people who ask questions about getting started in acting on television and in the cinema are fans of the shows they want to work on and there is nothing wrong with that but you need to realize that being a fan dose not mean that you should be an employee of the show too many people have the idea that they are going to go to an open casting call wow the casting director and get a spot on their favorite show honestly your chances are probably better at winning the lottery than this scenario ever happening there is no magic formula to follow that guarantees you success if there is this business wouldn t be this hard to get into to but what i can show you is the path to start on if you really want to make a go of this as a career you have to figure out if acting is really what you want to do or if you only want to do it because you are a fan of a particular show or movie or if it s a passing trend would you be just as happy if no one outside of your community knew who you were but you got to act every week at the local theatre or are you after the money fame and celebrity status that might come your way if your answer has anything to do with the second option stop right now and find another line of work start getting training you can take classes in your school all the way through college or if your town offers a professional acting class all the better you have no idea how many people say i love acting and i know i could be great but i have no training and i ve never acted before that s like asking an airline to make you a pilot but you don t know how to fly a plane obviously foolish start with local plays and build your experience any actor worth their trade will tell you that you never stop training read read read read books not only on the art of acting but also the business of acting as well you re never to young to arm yourself with information concerning the business and how it really works later in life if this becomes your profession the information you ve gained will be invaluable you can buy tons of books on line or check out your library once you ve gotten to the point where you ve done the research and got some training you need to get yourself professional headshots and this is going to cost money if you want to be taken seriously as a professional you need professional headshots digital copies from mom s camera ain t gonna cut it nor will photos from your yearbook or glamour shots you will need to find a reputable headshot photographer and hire them to book a session prices usually range anywhere from and up make up artists are extra and will range from dollars extra now you need to get a couple hundred copies made to prepare for your auditions and mailings now a reality check if you want to make a go of this you will need to be in los angeles la is the film and television mecca for entertainment likewise if you wanted to work in theatre you need to be in new york it s just a simple fact that you will need to adjust too how many professional surfers have you ever heard of who spend all their time in iowa after you have your head shots you or your parents need to start submitting to auditions simply put unless you have a very specific look or talent no reputable agent is going to take you on with no experience they need to know that they can sell you and in turn make money if they can t then it s not in their best interest to represent you you can find auditions through on line services such as la casting actor s access and now casting keep in mind that these sites usually charge a monthly fee for their services again this will cost you money up front we never said getting into acting was cheap after you have landed a few jobs you can start to submit to agencies or invite agents to see you in showcases if an agent likes what they see you can structure a deal with them keep in mind that a legit agent will never ask for money up front however they will get at a minimum of your earnings once you ve booked a job tell the agent up front if you have aspirations to work on a certain show of type of film but the reality is you ll have little chance to select the work you go out for initially a good place to start would be the publications put out by wolf press or through http ww sag org so you still want to be an actor actress then you have to be proactive about it do the research find the agents and make the contacts no one is going to do that for you without you paying for it acting as a profession involves long hard hours of training and work possibly thousands of dollars in headshots monthly bill fees and training and that s just to get a chance to audition long answer short get your training read to get yourself informed do plays locally to get experience get your headshots do small parts to build upon to get experience for your resume submit to agents then finally you may have your shot as fun as it sounds and from time to time it is fun acting is still a job you have to respect it and prepare for it just like any other job if you think you can stand in front of a camera repeat a few lines and make millions then stay in school and look for another profession on the other hand if this is really what you want to do and you re willing to make the sacrifice and do the hard work early on we may just see you on the screen before you know it best of

is there anyway to get into acting proffesionally im almost and was wondering if it is possible to make it into movie acting an still study my years in university you can but it's a hard balance to maintain at this piont i would highly recommend checking into your university's and neighboring u's film schools to see if students can make use of your talents for their films you'll gain lots of good experence working in vastly differing environments good and bad and you may get good stuff for your reel your education is important so i wouldn't bail on that you do have summer though and if you're lucky you could find an agent who would respect that and keep you on hold while you are in school the problem would be if you booked a series or something anyway cross that bridge if when you come to it if you have the training and credits to back yourself up and you want to pursue getting an agent you can find a legitimate agent to represent you for commercials tv film by going to sag org use the dropdown menu on the right labeled 'resources' and choose 'agent information' on the next screen on the left choose 'find a sag franchised agent' and follow the directions you can look up agents all over the us but there are higher concentrations where the work is los angeles ny il fl ga etc another great resource is ross reports especially because they update their info so often but not all of the agents they list are sag and you have to pay for the list that doesn t mean they re not legit but that s why i always tell people to start with the sag list it s free and those agents have signed an agreement to put the actor first www rossreports com if you subscribe to backstage com you can get a combo subscription which can come in handy but can also get quite expensive then you can send the agencies your headshot resume and a cover letter stating that you are seeking representation and wait to see if they call you in for an interview you never call the agencies directly that is a big no no at least it is in la please remember that reputable agents take exactly of your pay after they help you get a job not one cent more and not one cent before anything else is a scam this is strictly for talent agents not modeling agents or talent managers who take different percentages once you have an agent they will get you the auditions but until then you can check out actorsaccess com you can also see if your state has a film alliance commission society or whatever your state calls theirs some have more than one sometimes they post audition information for projects filming locally for theatre and other auditions on backstage you can go to backstage com or www actorsequity com click on casting call if you find the audition on the equity site you still may be able to go as long as their not taking appointments from equity actor's only on backstage com you have to pay to get all of the info but the initial search is free and you may be able to see enough info to find out the rest on your own without paying these websites also have listings for student films and going without an agent means choosing your own schedule which may be more ideal for a student good luck  Internet fraud Slot machine Modelling agency Unemployment Economics Advance fee fraud Education in the People's Republic of China MMORPG Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Corporate governance Financial audit Plame affair Professional wrestling slang Spam (electronic) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Divorce Scientology beliefs and practices National Football League Web crawler Search engine optimization Domain Name System Cable television Enterprise content management Microeconomics Advertising Principal-agent problem The Jackson 5 Film Graduate school World Wide Web Student loan Theory of conduct United States Postal Service Credit card Tax X Window System Screenwriting Call centre Education in the United States E-mail spam Nuclear power Education Security (finance) United Kingdom corporation tax Debt Karl Rove Child support Publicly funded medicine Secretar__a de Inteligencia Education in Germany Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Legal research Digital rights management American Football League Free trade Charmed Mutual fund Lloyd's of London Airline AmigaOS The Standard Mattress MapleStory Meat Loaf Teletext Primerica Financial Services Education in Portugal Pump It Up Capitalism Israeli Arab RuneScape Voice actor Annuity Betting (poker) Notary public A Course In Miracles Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Charter school Social Security (United States) Password Windows XP Database management system Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Movie projector Salary cap Finance 2005 Kashmir earthquake

anyone please anyone that became an actress or model please tell me how u broke into the business and tell me what agency u chose thankss any auditions u know of here's my advice no matter your age you need support from your family and friends if you're under age you absolutely need to have the full support of your family because they not only need to sign off on your contracts and be your advocate be fully aware of all child labor laws and help uphold them while you're on set but they need to drive you to all your auditions and stay on set with you at all times or hire someone to be there with you the next thing you need is training if you're not already you need to get into classes asap acting classes voice lessons and dance classes then you need to get involved in theatre get a few roles on your resume then start trying for some student films and independents info to follow most agents will not consider you unless you have training and credits when you've accomplished the above and you want to find a legitimate agent to represent you for commercials tv film go to sag org use the dropdown menu on the right labeled 'resources' and choose 'agent information' on the next screen on the left choose 'find a sag franchised agent' and follow the directions you can look up agents all over the us but there are higher concentrations where the work is los angeles ny il fl ga etc another great resource is ross reports especially because they update their info so often but not all of the agents they list are sag and you have to pay for the list that doesn t mean they re not legit but that s why i always tell people to start with the sag list it s free and those agents have signed an agreement to put the actor first www rossreports com if you subscribe to backstage com you can get a combo subscription which can come in handy but can also get quite expensive then you can send the agencies your headshot resume and a cover letter stating that you are seeking representation and wait to see if they call you in for an interview you never call the agencies directly that is a big no no at least it is in la please remember that reputable agents take exactly of your pay after they help you get a job not one cent more and not one cent before anything else is a scam this is strictly for talent agents not modeling agents or talent managers who take different percentages as for which afgent when you're new you don't usually get to be picky you do the mailing and see who's even interested if you get more than one bite from your mailing meet with them and see who you have the best rapport with once you have an agent they will get you the auditions but until then you can check out actorsaccess com you can also see if your state has a film alliance commission society or whatever your state calls theirs some have more than one sometimes they post audition information for projects filming locally for theatre and other auditions on backstage you can go to backstage com or www actorsequity com click on casting call if you find the audition on the equity site you still may be able to go as long as their not taking appointments from equity actor's only on backstage com you have to pay to get all of the info but the initial search is free and you may be able to see enough info to find out the rest on your own without paying fyi in my opinion for tv film acting the place to go is la and for modeling it's ny all the way for modeling info start here http www fordmodels com main cfm click on global scouting http www elitemodel com

i'd would like actors' opinions on why you got into acting in the first place i've been an actor for a long time and i've talked to many professional actors both famous and not so famous about this very few say they're in show business for the fun of it perhaps this is idealistic on my part but i only do it because i enjoy it i've made some money acting and that's always nice but if i didn't like it i wouldn't do it professionals talk about the 'work' of acting and getting the next 'job' which is fine but nobody every says something like this is the funnest job i've ever had yes acting is hard work and it takes comittment and dedication and it must be taken seriously which i totally agree with i'm very professional when i'm working on a show i'm just curious as to what others have to say about this in my mind it is possible to do this as a profession and have fun at it too like my grandmother always said find something that you love to do and make that your career and you'll never have to work a day in your life so i did i got into acting without the decision to make it a career i have seen what a career in acting can do to a family and i decided it wasn't for me but i love performing i perform i teach and i learn if i were in it for the money i'd be very bitter by now but i kept that part out of it and just worked hard got involved in as many shows as possible kept my work hours as flexible as i could and just went out and did it years later i settled down and now i have a family but i still perform and i still teach i think my experience as a kid helped me set my goals differently than most i didn't want to be famous or be rich from acting i just wanted to perform and some applause would be nice i love watching my students as much as performing i got to see things from a wow this is neat perspective rather than how can i get ahead i learned to be competitive without being too cut throat i hope i imagine doing this as a job would have its rewards but it comes at such a cost that i admire those who can balance it i was fortunate to know what i wanted from life and from acting and i'm glad to say i have them both good for you for finding your balance too  W.

how do i get discovered for acting and modeling i live in pennsylvania what are some tips on how to get discovered im short blonde blue eyed and i'm really good at acting and modeling i need to be dicovered we dont have much money for agents and stuff though names of free modeling or acting agencies would help too um im sorry but i dont really think that there are free agencies because i am and i loved to act sing model since i was or and i went to an acting school for they said i have incredible acting skills but i need to work on memorizing a bit so i am practicing a lot i was looking for agencies and coaches but they all require money i think someone in your family can be your agent though which would pr bably be free not sure but its hard because they have to find auditions and stuff for you im sure you will need to spend money though on your way to become a star so try babysitting or something just to earn a couple extra bucks you know it sucks cuz my family isnt rich so we cant spend thousands of dollars for this well i hope you get discovered i understand how much you love to act cuz i would do so much for singing and acting i really wanna get discovered too but i would recommend doing school plays to practice cuz there's always room for improvement and even if you don't get a big part in the play remember that you have to start somewhere and if you dont get the lead youre not bad it just means that someone else fit the part a little better because theres probably other people that wanted the lead lol any more questions you can always try to email me and ill help you as much as i can hope we all get discovered and good luck finding an agency  Hamlet Ghost William Shakespeare King Claudius Shakespeare on screen The Lion King Hamlet (1996 film) Blackadder Shakespeare's reputation Tales from the Public Domain Thou Mary, the mother of Jesus Richard III (play) Soliloquy Shakespearean authorship Julius Caesar (play) Shakespeare's sonnets Rom__o et Juliette Reduced Shakespeare Company Gertrude Stein Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead Tragic hero Macbeth Tom Stoppard Highlander (film) Conversion of Dale-Gudbrand References in Star Trek Music history of the United States (1960s and 70s) Christopher Marlowe Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Pansy Pericles, Prince of Tyre The Dunciad A Midwinter's Tale Mark Rylance Sarah Bernhardt Gesta Danorum Thomas (Apostle) Subjunctive mood The Conscience of the King The Tempest (play) Tragedy Cunt Minstrel show Royal Shakespeare Company Euphemism BBC Television Shakespeare Soul Hathor John Updike Pentagram Sharon Tate Dulwich Hamlet F.C.

can anybody please help i want to act more than anything any advice if you do please click first off let me say that this question is asked almost ever day in one form or another so if this answer doesn t satisfy you feel free to browse through the other million answers already given now that being said this is the reality most of the people who ask questions about getting started in acting on television and in the cinema are fans of the shows they want to work on and there is nothing wrong with that but you need to realize that being a fan dose not mean that you should be an employee of the show too many people have the idea that they are going to go to an open casting call wow the casting director and get a spot on their favorite show honestly your chances are probably better at winning the lottery than this scenario ever happening there is no magic formula to follow that guarantees you success if there is this business wouldn t be this hard to get into to but what i can show you is the path to start on if you really want to make a go of this as a career you have to figure out if acting is really what you want to do or if you only want to do it because you are a fan of a particular show or movie or if it s a passing trend would you be just as happy if no one outside of your community knew who you were but you got to act every week at the local theatre or are you after the money fame and celebrity status that might come your way if your answer has anything to do with the second option stop right now and find another line of work start getting training you can take classes in your school all the way through college or if your town offers a professional acting class all the better you have no idea how many people say i love acting and i know i could be great but i have no training and i ve never acted before that s like asking an airline to make you a pilot but you don t know how to fly a plane obviously foolish start with local plays and build your experience any actor worth their trade will tell you that you never stop training read read read read books not only on the art of acting but also the business of acting as well you re never to young to arm yourself with information concerning the business and how it really works later in life if this becomes your profession the information you ve gained will be invaluable you can buy tons of books on line or check out your library once you ve gotten to the point where you ve done the research and got some training you need to get yourself professional headshots and this is going to cost money if you want to be taken seriously as a professional you need professional headshots digital copies from mom s camera ain t gonna cut it nor will photos from your yearbook or glamour shots you will need to find a reputable headshot photographer and hire them to book a session prices usually range anywhere from and up make up artists are extra and will range from dollars extra now you need to get a couple hundred copies made to prepare for your auditions and mailings now a reality check if you want to make a go of this you will need to be in los angeles la is the film and television mecca for entertainment likewise if you wanted to work in theatre you need to be in new york it s just a simple fact that you will need to adjust too how many professional surfers have you ever heard of who spend all their time in iowa after you have your head shots you or your parents need to start submitting to auditions simply put unless you have a very specific look or talent no reputable agent is going to take you on with no experience they need to know that they can sell you and in turn make money if they can t then it s not in their best interest to represent you you can find auditions through on line services such as la casting actor s access and now casting keep in mind that these sites usually charge a monthly fee for their services again this will cost you money up front we never said getting into acting was cheap after you have landed a few jobs you can start to submit to agencies or invite agents to see you in showcases if an agent likes what they see you can structure a deal with them keep in mind that a legit agent will never ask for money up front however they will get at a minimum of your earnings once you ve booked a job tell the agent up front if you have aspirations to work on a certain show of type of film but the reality is you ll have little chance to select the work you go out for initially a good place to start would be the publications put out by wolf press or through http ww sag org so you still want to be an actor actress then you have to be proactive about it do the research find the agents and make the contacts no one is going to do that for you without you paying for it acting as a profession involves long hard hours of training and work possibly thousands of dollars in headshots monthly bill fees and training and that s just to get a chance to audition long answer short get your training read to get yourself informed do plays locally to get experience get your headshots do small parts to build upon to get experience for your resume submit to agents then finally you may have your shot as fun as it sounds and from time to time it is fun acting is still a job you have to respect it and prepare for it just like any other job if you think you can stand in front of a camera repeat a few lines and make millions then stay in school and look for another profession on the other hand if this is really what you want to do and you re willing to make the sacrifice and do the hard work early on we may just see you on the screen before you know it best of luck  Highway 61 Revisited Time Out of Mind Whale song The Velvet

how do actresses train to develop their voices not that i want to be an actress i just want to have a clear voice like one many of them take lessons to learn the proper forms of breathing posture when to belt when to be nasely and when to back off a note you need to have enough knowledge of your voice what it can handle and what challenges the song you're singing presents to your voice what sets actresses apart is that they really study the score and know when to make it impressive when to back off a litttle to save their voices and when to breath when you breath try lifting up your palate and when you sing concentrate on pushing the sound outwards and upwards and not allowing yourself to get bogged down by a depressing song when you can stand with your back straight head erect shoulders back and legs shoulder width apart concentrate on breathining and singing from your diaphram with every breath and note your diaphram should be heaving  $ale of the Century The Amazing Race Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Wheel of Fortune Screenplay Mutual fund Photography Plame affair Poker jargon Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Marilyn Monroe FairTax Sharon Tate Education in the United States Knots Landing Microeconomics The Price Is Right Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 2005 trial of Michael Jackson TLC Shaggy dog story Scientology beliefs and practices The Ashlee Simpson Show United States Postal Service Game show Citigroup Jeopardy!

can i be a actor and then be a director because i though if i can be an actor but still go to collge to major in filmmaking i can have the money to budget my own film can i do that can i act then later be a director but i also want to act because not only i want to make a film i would love to be in one and in commerical and shows too absolutely many actors have turned to directing later on ron howard ring a bell the only things that concerns me is that you seem to be banking that you'll make enough money as an actor to finance a film of your own later on this could be an indie or a major feature but whatever the case may be just be aware that both of these professions require a tremendous amount of training work and dedication if you choose to use one as a means to an end to another you may find that neither one comes out exactly the way you want it if you want to be a director focus on that aspect and instead of working as an actor dabble with producing a little bit you'll find that it's much easier to raise money to finance a film than it will be to work as an actor and raise the money yourself  Yul Brynner Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor Shirley Booth Jack Albertson Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical Jos__ Ferrer Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play Audrey Hepburn Academy Award Fred Ebb Margaret Leighton Rex Harrison The King and I Rodgers and Hammerstein Actor Michael Cacoyannis Henry Fonda Musical theater Liza Minnelli Angela Lansbury The Ed Sullivan Show Academy Award for Best Actress Academy Award for Costume Design Mel Brooks Julie Andrews Patty Duke Bette Davis Tony Award The Magnificent Seven Cyrano de Bergerac Broadway theatre Academy Award for Directing Whoopi Goldberg My Fair Lady Jack Gilford Chita Rivera Spamalot Ralph Fiennes Tony Award for Best Original Score Mary-Louise Parker Anthony Quinn Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama William Shatner Laurence Olivier Cabaret (musical) Martin Scorsese Academy Award for Best Picture Orson Welles John Cromwell (director) Jack Nicholson Wicked (musical) Grammy Awards of 2004 Guitarist Marlon Brando Christopher Plummer Academy Award for Film Editing Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay Stage name Academy Award for Best Cinematography Paul Newman The Ten Commandments (1956 film) Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical Katharine Hepburn G__rard Depardieu Alan Alda Sally Ann Howes Jane Wyman Les Mis__rables (musical) Anita Ekberg Barbra Streisand The Miracle Worker Thelma Ritter Another World (TV series) Claudette Colbert Rita Moreno Jerry Herman Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album Kander and Ebb Tony Shalhoub Hal Prince Robert Morse Academy Award for Original Music Score Tyrone Power All About Eve Marvin Hamlisch Cyrano de Bergerac (play) Irene Papas Cher (entertainer) Shakespeare on screen Susan Hayward John Lithgow AVN Awards Celebrity appearances in Doctor Who A Man for All Seasons

what do youll wear to acting auditions also can youll tell me exactly what youll wear and wouldnt wear thanks in los angeles wear neat comfortable clothing i know you want to look nice but make sure you can move around the room and don't wear a costume your outfit can suggest the character such as a high collar blouse for a period piece but don't get all dressed up avoid solid whites very bright colors and busy patterns jeans are a gamble wear them only if they are clean and if they are appropriate for the role some casting directors don't like jeans and others don't mind you have to decide if you are willing to take that chance with your first impression wear nice clean casual clothes in solid pastels or neutral colors the should be comfortable enough to allow you to move without feeling constrained the fit and colors should flatter your skin and body dressing for the part is risky you may end up looking out of place ask your agent if the client specified what they want you to wear if you are auditioning for the part of a doctor wear something loose and casual if you are auditioning for a sexy character role wear something classy that flatters your figure if you do not feel comfortable in the clothing it will show be remembered while it's certainly a valid point that you don't want the auditors to be distracted by your clothing or pay more attention to what you're wearing than what you're doing clothing is most definitely a useful tool in making your presence a memorable one it has often happened while sitting in on an audition that i've heard the one with the purple scarf bring her back in my point is even if they've fallen in love with you they still may not remember your name and a distinctive article of clothing or accessory can cause a memory jog callbacks always make a note of what you wore to an audition if you are invited to callbacks make sure you wear the same thing the audition panel will often use your outfit to help remember who you are  HyperText Transfer Protocol Live 8 Domain Name System FAQ Website The Princeton Review The nature of God in Western theology World Wide Web 50 Cent Extreme Programming Avenue Q RuneScape cheats Altruism Socrates Crossword Computational complexity theory HTTP cookie Kuzari Web server Logic Cliff Richard GED Gregg Alexander Virtual hosting Apache HTTP Server Theory of conduct Squid cache Federalist No. 10 Milgram experiment Jeff Gannon Kasparov versus The World Uniform Resource Locator Current teachings of Prem Rawat Science Parliament of Malaysia Socratic method Education Evaluation Determinism QI Donna Summer Scopes Trial Free will Electronic commerce Theatre Censorship in cyberspace Slashdot subculture Bernard Williams Theodicy Freedom of speech Economics Right to silence Summa Theologiae 3-2-1 Republic (dialogue) Halting problem Complexity classes P and NP Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act STS-59 Clarity Act Poker jargon Assessment Sheryl Crow Translation Polish language Zoroaster Wget Ja Rule Pauline epistles The Ashlee Simpson Show CPAN G__del's incompleteness theorem Apocrypha Inquiry education Coercion Parsifal Authorship of the Pauline epistles The Joker's Wild Scientology beliefs and practices Meaning of life Le Malade imaginaire Stomach cancer Freedom of information legislation The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything BitTorrent British House of Commons Goodness and value theory Usher (entertainer) Marbury v.

how should the perfect headshot be i am clueless s o can anybody describe the perfect headshot as int pose size etc a standard headshot is x traditionally they are in black and white but the trend is now leaning heavily towards color your headshot should look like you not some glamazoned out airbrushed version if you get called in for an audition based on your headshot you need to be able to go in looking exactly like to you do in the photo therefore if you cut color your hair new headshots gain lose significant weight new headshots etc most actors have headshots a theatrical and a commerical a theatrical headshot is usually more serious with a closed mouth expression a commerical headshot is with an open mouthed smile and much more friendly the point of having different looks is to be able to submit to different projects that may require different types you don't really pose for headshots the way models pose for shoots you have a general position and usually change your expression more than anything else you want to convey personality and have that alive look in your eyes you don't have to be the most beautiful person to have a great headshot that makes an agent pause to look at it and think wow it is definiately not easy to get that perfect shot so it's important to find a good photographer that you feel comfortable with so that you don't look posed and aritficial and ideally you should get at least shots or rolls of film out of the session to choose from check out some of these well known photographers all in ny webites to get an idea of what a good headshot should look like http www kriscarrphotography com http robertkim com http ronrinaldi com http www starkstudio com http www jordanmatter com  Sly & the Family Stone The Ashlee Simpson Show Music genre Bohemian Rhapsody The Velvet Underground Louie, Louie Rhythm and blues Pop music The Doors Hip hop music Rush (band) Rock (music) Rock and roll Love and Theft Heavy metal music Steely Dan The Kinks Rod Stewart Gary Glitter The Strokes Karaoke The Supremes Journey (band) Blues Empire Burlesque Robert Palmer (British singer) Joni Mitchell Noel Gallagher Funk Music history of the United States Southern rock Please Please Me R.E.M.

please answer ok well i want to be an actress and i don't really know how to find auditions real ones that can get you into a tv series or a movie do you have to have an agent to get you to auditions let me know yes training is the key but obviously you don't need to wait until college to go for it if your family supports your goals you can and should start now especially with classes you should keep your grades up and you absolutely should plan on getting a college education because being an actor makes you your own business and being well educated and knowing how to run that business will be key to not getting taken advantage of and making smart business decisions in the future get yourself into classes for acting dance and voice lessons after that audition for local theatre productions then move on to student films and independants info to follow once you have a few roles to put on your resume you can try to get an agent if you want to find a legitimate agent to represent you for commercials tv film go to sag org use the dropdown menu on the right labeled 'resources' and choose 'agent information' on the next screen on the left choose 'find a sag franchised agent' and follow the directions you can look up agents all over the us but there are higher concentrations where the work is los angeles ny il fl ga etc another great resource is ross reports especially because they update their info so often but not all of the agents they list are sag and you have to pay for the list that doesn t mean they re not legit they absolutely are but that s why i always tell people to start with the sag list it s free and those agents have signed an agreement to put the actor first www rossreports com if you subscribe to backstage com you can get a combo subscription which can come in handy but can also get quite expensive then you can send the agencies your headshot resume and a cover letter stating that you are seeking representation and wait to see if they call you in for an interview you never call the agencies directly that is a big no no at least it is in la once you have an agent they will get you the auditions but until then you can check out actorsaccess com you can also see if your state has a film alliance commission society or whatever your state calls theirs some have more than one sometimes they post audition information for projects filming locally for theatre and other auditions on backstage you can go to backstage com or www actorsequity com click on casting call if you find the audition on the equity site you still may be able to go as long as their not taking appointments from equity actor's only on backstage com you have to pay to get all of the info but the initial search is free and you may be able to see enough info to find out the rest on your own without paying don't forget that legit agents take of your pay after they help get you a job not one cent before and not one cent more good luck  Taxation in the United States Social Security (United States) Child support Bond Insurance Federal Reserve Food and Drug Administration Minimum wage Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States New Deal Mutual fund Environmental Protection Agency Student loan FairTax Citigroup Credit card Tennessee Valley Authority Real estate broker Debt Flat tax European Space Agency Divorce United States Agency for International Development Defense Logistics Agency Tertiary education fees in Australia Education in the United States Public transport Wal-Mart Economic inequality Credit rating agency Economic rent Financial services Warren Buffett Contract with America Stock Legal aid Copyright law of the United Kingdom Progressive tax Unemployment Bay Area Rapid Transit Economy of the United States Pension Campaign finance reform Social Security debate (United States) Opportunity cost Plame affair Credit score No Child Left Behind Act Reparations for slavery Japan Self-Defense Forces Medicare (Canada) Food Stamp Program Cerritos, California Capitalism Remediation Principal-agent problem Microeconomics Graduate school Airline Deregulation Act Health insurance United Nations Open access Income Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Income tax Micropayment Anarchism and capitalism Defense budget of Japan San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Education United States Marshals Service Reserve clause 401(k) Microcredit National Health Service Agricultural policy Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority Rick Santorum Advertising Temasek Holdings Agricultural Adjustment Act Environment Agency Union shop Tom Ridge Adoption H-1B visa Screenplay Municipal bond Tax Efficiency wages Air Force Reserve Command Canadian Space Agency Inflation National Kidney Foundation Singapore Non-governmental organization National Football League Players' Association Emissions trading Prostitution History of the United States (1918-1945) Compensation of employees

i want to get some acting jobs how do i find a legit agent in boston ma talent agents for actors come in two main types theatrical television and film and commercial for commercials there are also dance print and voice over agents who specialize in these fields and signing with one of these agents can be a great way for actors with these other skills to cross over into one of the other areas being with the same agency for everything is called being signed across the board but many actors prefer to have separate agents for different types of work become some agencies might be strong commercially but not as strong theatrically or vice versa agents get information about auditions for roles either directly from casting directors and producers calling them asking for client submissions or from a fax email service called the breakdowns a daily list of roles being cast sent only to agents and managers although there is a black market for this information within the acting community and many actors without representation self submit for available roles which some casting people don't mind others hate and the owner of breakdown services abhors remember actors your agents work for you but they only get of what you make so that means you need to do of the work especially when you are getting started that means always be professional know your craft don't shy away from networking and letting cd producers and directors know about your accomplishments upcoming appearances by sending out postcards know your type and how you fit into the current market and above all make sure you and your agent are on the same page about what kinds of parts you will be submitted for and never pay an agent or manager up front to represent you they only make money when they make you money the plan of attack most agents refuse any off the street drop ins in other words they'll see new talent by appointment only don't bother phoning in for one just yet because without a face you're just another voice and unless that voice is absolutely incredible and the agent handles a lot of voice over work it simply won't get you in instead mail off your photo and resume along with a very special cover letter what makes that letter so special simple prove that you understand how valuable their time is so many people try cramming in their whole hopes and dreams autobiography into the cover letter it resembles a chapter from a novel the agent hasn't the time nor the interest to be a publisher any submission that takes more than seconds to scan through and read will likely be filed in the trash here's a sample of how to keep it short wannabe talent hopeful avenue dreamland bc attn ms a gent please accept my photos and resume for possible consideration of future representation i will contact your offices next week to verify your receipt of this package thank you very much for your time johnny smartguy that's it nothing else just plain and simple the agent even has seconds left to take a quick glance at your photo s and stats now the big trick comes the following week give it a full week before calling in and try to make the call on a tuesday or wednesday when they may be less frantic in the office just call up and say hi my name's johnny smartguy and i'm just calling to confirm you received my photo and resume chances are you'll get a response of the agents will be looking at it or there are no openings right now try back in a few months or even the infamous the agents will call you back if they're interested whatever the response simply answer no problem i don't want to take up your time i just promised i would make sure the package got there okay i don't want to keep you thank you very much for your time pause they'll either be impressed and relieved at the short conversation or they'll be caught so off guard that they'll try to explain further if they haven't said goodbye then just repeat a variation of your previous words always offering them the opportunity to end the conversation and reinforcing that you know their time is valuable they're so used to the can i come in pleading that you've really thrown them for a loop by not asking them for something call the better business bureau to see if any complaints have been made against the agency tips warnings agents making their living by earning a percentage of each job they book for a model do not pay any up front fees to an agent if you're not happy with the number of auditions or bookings you are getting set up an appointment with your agent and discuss what you can do to generate more jobs if the agent lies to you makes outrageous promises or asks for up front money to cover phone calls or mailing expenses on your behalf keep looking legitimate agents do not ask for expense money go to the website link below it is the screen actors guild agent list for both sag franchised and non franchised agencies in all states http www sag org sagwebapp

should technical theatre resumes have years on them i have heard both sides of the argument should i include the years of the shows or not and why thanks in general theatre resumes don't need to have years on them some one looking at your resume is more interested in your range of experience and possibly the companies you've worked with and isn't too concerned with when you did each job if you are submitting your resume for something other than a tech job say for admission to college or grad school then you might want to include dates in case they want to verify the facts or if you want to highlight the number of years of experience you have i'm a director and when i see dates on a resume it's usually a person who is fairly green you might want to consider which choice would make your resume seem more impressive if you've been doing theatre for many years and you want to show that off you could include them or if you want to show that you were a part of some now well known company early on sure you could include dates but if you just started this work recently you would probably want to direct attention to the type range of experience and not necessarily showcase how long or not long you've been doing it  Wicked (musical) Broadway theatre University of Denver Blue Man Group Theatre Sally Ann Howes King Crimson Bee Gees The Waterboys The Jackson 5 Sonic Youth Jerry Springer - The Opera The Supremes The Monkees The Jam The Jazz Singer Lindy Hop Before the Flood The Yardbirds Madonna (entertainer) Alain Boublil David Bowie Chicago theatre Fargo, North Dakota Rock and roll The Bootleg Series Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue New York City Subway Hair (musical) M__tley Cr__e Music genre Improvisational comedy Eddie Kramer Mississippi John Hurt The Doors Nirvana (band) Les Mis__rables (musical) Jerry Herman Disc jockey Gerome Ragni Dream Theater Rammstein New Order Porgy and Bess Jesus Christ Superstar Journey (band) The Beatles Ben Elton Movie theater Jandek Ethel Merman New York Giants Jelly Roll Morton Super Bowl Warren Haynes Led Zeppelin Adore Santa Rosa, California Oasis (band) Spamalot Miles Davis Ian McKellen Fleetwood Mac African American music Edinburgh Fringe Tony Bennett Bo Diddley Circus Actor The Band Sun Ra Deep Purple Nat King Cole Pink Floyd Blonde on Blonde Styx (band) Music history of the United States Stand-up comedy Art Ensemble of Chicago Eric Clapton Louis Armstrong Chicago (band) Johnnie Ray Rhythm and blues The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical) Ramones Clear Channel Communications Pow-wow Ritchie Blackmore Grateful Dead Christian Death Bruce Springsteen Billy Joel Mot__rhead Beastie Boys James Taylor Roxy Music New York City Fred Ebb Marching band History of the Beatles

anyone have any thoughts on this i think it's perfectly normal for a young kid to think they can grow up to be famous but most of the kids who post questions here want to be famous now imo that's another matter altogether that's seems a bit sick to me especially when a kid gets lots of answers explaining why it's not realistic and then asks the same question over and over the first time it can be chalked up to naivette after that there's no excuse dumb adults invariably started out as dumb kids i know plenty of adults who try and fail time and time again to get rich it never occurs to them they don't have what it takes and they never will they live in a state of perpetual disappointment it's normal and healthy to fantasize and lots of the kids who post here will get over the idea fast but i think there are plenty of kids on here who are flat out delusional and will grow up to be the same way any thoughts ok well st i understand that you are directing the question to me who always asks so what if you think im dumb and ill never be what i want to i dont care because its my life and i know i have what it takes that sir is my thought towards your question  Photography Screen Actors Guild Digital photography Cheating in Counter-Strike Modelling agency Mutual fund MMORPG Child pornography Final Fantasy XI All My Children Mattress MapleStory Craps Copyright law of the United Kingdom Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Film Money supply Computer Stereoscopy Voice actor Real estate broker Capital accumulation Geographic information system Traditional animation Nintendo GameCube Copyleft Inflation Neopets Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Annuity Roman currency Screenplay Paintball Nude celebrities on the Internet Poker jargon Brassiere Screenwriting United States Postal Service Social rule Unemployment Public transport Marilyn Monroe Contract GunBound Monopoly (game) Karen McDougal Marlon Brando Drawing Academic publishing Hitman (computer game) Personality psychology Labour economics Labor theory of value Prostate cancer Cinematography Grade (education) Electronic commerce Diablo II Cancer Independent Media Center Upholstery Economy of the United States Motion picture rating system Ragnarok Online Open access Counter-Strike Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Alexander Technique Common Lisp Volkswagen Type 2 Public policy Casting Deus Ex: Invisible War National Kidney Foundation Singapore Education in the People's Republic of China Publishing Advance fee fraud Pyramid scheme Expert system Slot machine Asperger syndrome Archery Call centre John Lott Minor league baseball Economics Software engineering Outsourcing Trailer Park Boys

how to balance time between theater and work i have a part time job and now i've become interested in becoming an actor and as i know you have to start in community theater how can i balance time between these two things and how can i deal with it when the new school year starts please help i am going to be taking an acting class in school the main question im asking is how can i do community theatre without missing work i am more than merely interested in acting it is something i feel i have to do i was just wondering what kind of part time job would be best so that i can support myself while doing what i love most depending on where you live and whom you are the problem varies if there are a lot of part time employment opportunities in your area but few acting opportunities you should commit to whatever acting opportunity is available and find the right job to compliment it on the other hand if there are a number of opportunities to act and to work you should find the best mix it takes research to find what the real opportunities are generally people who are interested in becoming actors will never be successful success is generally limited to those who must act  Live 8 $ale of the Century ITunes Music Store Shaggy dog story Internet fraud Calvin and Hobbes Public transport Taxation in the United States Surveillance FoxTrot Electronic commerce Jennifer Lopez Grand Central Terminal Filling station Google Microeconomics IPod Advertising The Amazing Race U2 (band) Kylie Minogue Octopus card New England Patriots Textile manufacturing Madonna (entertainer) Supply and demand New York Giants Computer and video games Price discrimination Plame affair Nintendo DS Best Buy Denver, Colorado Wheel of Fortune Microsoft Wedding Crashers Animal Crossing Enron Corporation Neopets Satchel Paige Britney Spears Delta Goodrem Tax Ocean's Twelve Cincinnati Bengals Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dot-com Jayne Mansfield Michael Jackson John Lennon The Phantom Manor Mutual fund Futurama (TV series - season 5) Donald Trump Nintendo Power Day trading In-N-Out Burger Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.

did i make the right decision in becoming a theater major it was so much more fun in high school i actually felt like i was getting something done now i feel underappreciated and my hard work is shit upon i would go back to my dorm after a theater class and feel so bad that i would start crying i feel really stupid picking a career that doesn't promise much in the way or success i should have chosen a field in which i could at least have a chance to be successful you know one that actually appreciates the output and not the facetime i am about to begin my senior year and it is too late for me to change my major i also feel that as an african american woman there is no chance for me out there in entertainment i don't look like halle berry and am in my opinion not talented enough to succeed in hollywood or anywhere what can i do i just don't feel like i love it anymore i also get the vibe from those around me that i am either with the group or against it i grew up in santa barbara with actors eric stoltz and anthony edwards and they also had fun in high school doing plays etc then they both went to usc as theater majors they both dropped out the first year now look at them i'm not saying that you should drop out but just a though they both went on to study with the late peggy fuery and they learned more in her classes than they would have in four years of college you must make that decision for yourself whether or not you made the right decision as far as being an african america woman it is actually a big advantage i am on the screen actors guild ethnic equal opportunities committee and i am in the know about this good luck in your decision and i personally love to see people rough it out and stay the course  Graduate school Drama Social rule Explosive material Minimum wage Avenue Q Property (ownership right) Theatre W.

is the play the thing i am a produced and published playwright my latest work was presented at a tiny theater in nyc and now i've submitted it to a publisher recently i was contacted by a movie producer who is interested in filming the play i would prefer to wait til the play is published it is copyrighted already this way the movie producer purchases the film rights but i retain the performance rights as a play this may squash the whole deal though any thoughts i don't have an agent i don't make that kind of money wr garrity it's all tied up in contract negotiations we've produced a few films along the lines of what you're going through and in each instance it had to be presented very clearly as to who had the rights to what and so forth in reality you can have a contract state almost anything you want as long as all parties agree to what is stipulated what you need to be on the look out for is what is sometimes called a futre considerations clause in this case the producer films the play live but what happens down the road if they decide to develop what he films into a feature movie also i would check and see what they are looking for as far as display rights i mean you wouldn't want a film of your play running in a cinema right next to the playhouse granted that is an extreme worse case scenerio but you see what i mean i would suggest you speak with a lawyer who specializes in entertainment law and have them draft up a contract prior to production if you can't afford an attorney look around locally for a legal aid office sometimes they take a little while longer to produce the results you need but the cost difference can save you a ton of money  Voice actor American Idol Melissa Joan Hart Winona Ryder Sunshine Logro__o Halliburton Journey (band) Modelling agency Mandy Moore Dirk Benedict William Hung Edward Pawley Limp Bizkit History of SNL:1980-1985 Susie Carmichael Kristin Kreuk Financial audit Bestseller Little Britain Riley Smith Hannah Spearritt Play School Film Batman Forever Marlon Brando Eddie Murphy Wal-Mart General intelligence factor Mulholland Drive (film) Hollywood, Los Angeles, California Sally Ann Howes Meat Loaf Cheo Feliciano Tom Hanks Popular, Inc MythBusters Self Immolation Extras (sitcom) Comedy film Sal Mineo Psychiatric hospital W.E.B.

how can i become a voice actor without losing my day job i need to know if it's right for me without jeopardizing my family's income lots of information here but this is the basic answer we give people who want to consider a profession as a voice actor your basic reading skills are a must but you need to be able to read several different types manuscript or copy as it's known in the business you need to be able to pick up a newspaper and read it aloud you need to be able to pick up a medical journal and read it aloud lets face it you need to be able to pick up anything and be able to read it aloud here's the kicker you need to be able to do more than just read it you need to be able to speak the words on the paper as if they were your own this is one part of the talent many vo's spend countless hours training to learn how to do some of them learn how and some of them don't therein lies one of the needed talents you need to develop the ability to grab a piece of paper that is sometimes handed to you minutes before you go into the studio dissect it to find it's true message and read it aloud as if the words were flowing from you if you practice and practice and practice and still don't develop the ability then you might not have the talent some of the other talents that certainly help are the ability to act and be funny a lot of people might think they are funny but you need to be funny many of the commercials that are recorded today whether they are for television or radio have some aspect of comedy or comedic acting in them tandem spots tandem is more than one vo in the spot a spot is a commercial generally demand that the actors or voice actors be funny your time is best spent getting professional training from a qualified acting coach for acting and a voice over coach for learning voiceovers a coach will generally know if you have what it takes to advance in either career the third and probably most important is a good voice by good we mean clear listenable articulate and in some way unique one of the biggest misconceptions is that you have to have some sort of dynamic over the top high or low voice to get into the business not true what you need are the abilities mentioned above and a sharp concise speaking ability a very regional voice as in having an accent can hurt a lot more than it helps a very heavy accent or inner city affect will most likely not get you very many calls if that's one of your voice characteristics it's time to start working on getting rid of that accent talent is being able to turn it on or off don't loose it just find a way to turn it on and off it's totally possible to make a fairly decent living even by la standards by doing nothing but voice over work i have several friends that do almost nothing but voices for video games and they are getting booked all the time couple of things i noticed when they were starting out was that the ones who could do multiple voices comic scary announcer etc booked work a lot faster than others having a demo reel and a site where people can sample your work on line was also a huge plus also if you can get in with a manager or an agent that deals with voice over work they can be a huge help as most vo jobs don't get posted to breakdowns the way acting jobs do there are a number of classes and books that can give you tons of information on training and things to take into consideration if this is the path you want to follow though be warned the field of vo acting is almost more competitive than standard acting and quite a bit tougher to break into there are training programs that will range from a few hundred dollars for a basic introduction to a dollar week program a decent site to visit to see what you're up against is voices com the other thing to keep in mind is that once you have your training and you think you're demo ready you'll have to book studio time to record there is no real way to put a price on this because there is no way to tell how long your sessions would take or how much you want to record some industry figures are as show below recording fee dollars duplication fee dollars graphic design dollars cd cost dollars printing cost dollars distribution costs packing postage dollars keep in mind these prices will vary from market to market as well as studio to studio best of luck  Soap opera Russell T.

what is a good way to get noticed in showbiz i've always been intrested but i dont know how to start im even okay with being even a movie extra win america's got talent but seriously extra work will not get you noticed but anyone can be an extra in film and television unlike actors extras do not have agents who take a percent commission you simply register with extras casting companies and call in each day on their casting lines to get work unless you hire a booking service for about a month to call in and get you the work of course these calling or booking services really do not call in to get you the work they simply know people at the extras casting companies and get lists of what they need and act as sub casting agents think about it why would the extras casting company individually call each and every person when they can just call a booking service and say we need people for a party scene then the booking service does all the work and calls each of their clients themselves sag is trying to regulate these companies at some point but the fact remains that these services can get you much more work than you can on your own just calling in on the casting lines all day trying to get through the busy signals the screen actors guild does have jurisdiction over backround actors however the contracts only require a small number of union extras to be hired for a given union production and the rest of the extras are non union this is part of the contract that production companies sign with the union there is a publication called extra work for brain surgeons it truly is the bible of extra work i am not one to try to sell books for anyone but i am in the know about this subject central casting in the biggest extras casting company followed by bill dance casting you simply register with these places and then you work there is a huge amount of work for non union extras and just a small amount of union extra work as a matter of fact one can work every day as a non union extra but if you are a sag member it is much harder to get union extra jobs this is because a given tv show for example only has to hire union extras and the rest can be non union if you sign up with a booking service or calling service as they like to call themselves you can literally work every day but the pay is not much more than minimum wage for non union although overtime is usually the norm as well as wardrobe allowance and sometimes mileage allowance you also can get paid extra for using your car pet or props in a scene there are many sag members secretly doing non union extra work simply because there just is not enough union extra jobs to go around you must live in la of course get a thomas guide map book and have a cell phone and a car but if you do your homework you literally can work every day no matter your experience or looks you can be young or old tall or short overweight or underweight some one armed dude or whatever there is plenty of work to go around and hollywood needs all types of people you don't even need headshots or a resume they take a digital photo when you register with all of those extras casting companies just stick with the legit companies there is a nominal or so fee to register even sag member have to pay a photo fee to register so there it is don't take bad advice just register with the big extras casting companies and follow the rules of working as a fim tv extra as i said i am not out to sell that book you can do some research and find out all you need but be careful as there are tons of bottom feeders scamming people who want to work in film tv as extras if you are lucky you can even become sag eligible from doing non union extra work but that is a whole other long story here is a link to hollywoodos the company that publishes that book extra work for brain surgeons http hollywoodos com index php option com content task blogcategory id itemid peace out alan ps aftra american federation of television and radio artists has jurisdiction over soaps and sitcoms among other videotaped and radio broadcast productions this is a whole different story and anyone can walk into aftra and join for about  Wicked

what do i need to watch out for with my child i posted a question earlier about how to get my month old daughter into advertising auditions modeling etc to help provide money for her future is there anything in particular that i need to watch out for as far as scams for example i read somewhere that there are no fees associated with the business only a percentage taken upon payment of an awarded job or that with an infant we do not need to pay for an expensive photo shoot because they change so often that they generally only require casual snapshots taken by family or friends they recommended that if they try to tell you otherwise than it is not a safe place to go are these things true is there anything else that i need to look for or any tips that experienced people can offer me i really appreciate any help out there i think this would be a great opportunity for my daughter and would ease the stress on us trying to save up money for college for her there was an answer posted a while back for a similar question so i will repost it here in regards to having to pay money up front to an agent no you shouldn't have to managers on the other hand work a little differently for the photos well you have to understand that the photo that someone looks at has literally to seconds to catch someones eye this is sometimes the first and last best chance to make an impression if you want to be taken as a professional you need to have professional items to work with they will cost money up front and they will need to be retaken every few months or so i know some parents who get their kids shots retaken every four months usually costs about for the session plus reproduction fees but they are working contantly and make that all back plus more after the childs first booking but in response to your question here is the previous answer pick up a ross report or backstage paper at a newsstand both of them list agents and managers from there you begin the process of mailing pictures and letters expressing your interest the pictures should be an accurate representation of your child and they should be flattering no messy face crazy hair or other weirdness parents often send pictures they think are cute but are very unflattering to their child have someone not related look at them and tell you what they think you can also look for open casting calls many managers and print agents do these to find new talent there are various schools and talent searches competitions out there but at that is a waste of your money while many of these places do what they say and introduce you to agents and managers it is a hefty fee they charge there are also websites that for a fee will post your child s picture in the five years i worked as an agent i never met anybody who ever got any work this way they wasted their money and were put off by the whole business be sure this is something your child can do many kids are hams at home and around people they know put them in a strangers office and ask them to perform and they freeze up be prepared explain to your child what is expected of them nine times out of ten a small child becomes mute in my office and i am amazing with kids and very approachable most casting directors are not so your child has to be able to turn it on without any warming up otherwise it's see ya and as a last and most important piece of advice never pay money to get your kid in the business anybody who says you have to pay them to represent you is running a scam agents and managers get a percentage of what you are paid from jobs they book you on they only get paid if they find you work you should never give anything upfront if you don't work they don't get paid that's how the system works look for union approved agencies and you should be safe good luck and happy hunting  Drama The Ashlee Simpson Show Theory of conduct Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Parsifal EastEnders Whose Line Is It Anyway?

i can make myself cry but sometimes the tears won't come out i mean my eyes do get all red and i do look like i'm crying it's just that tears won't come out how can i make tears come out hi the reason you do not shed tears is because you might be dehydrated remember that tears are liquid and the tear gland function is to remove and lubricate your eyes with liquid the average water cosumption fo a person is about liters per kilograms of body weight i know that seems to be a lot of water but consider the effects not only do you rehydrate yourself but it could help detoxify your body from the food and liquids you take aside from that it could make your skin firmer and fresh looking  Status Quo (band) Beastie Boys Time Out of Mind The Game (rapper) Stephanie Mills Daz Dillinger Game show The Doors Mikhail Kasyanov Whose Line Is It Anyway? 50 Cent Leonard Cohen Mixtape The Beach Boys One-hit wonder Academy Award for Original Music Score Jennifer Lopez Lenny Kravitz The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Hikikomori Surf's Up Guilty Gear Waltzing Matilda The Guess Who Hip hop collaborations Grease (film) Michelle Branch Tonality Remix Talking Heads Jade Empire Dave Mustaine Hall & Oates Primus (band) Academy Award for Best Song Monkey Island Fuck Louie, Louie American Idiot Blackfoot music Kurt Cobain Harry Nilsson Poker jargon Jethro Tull (band) Chas and Dave Crazy in Love Out-of-order execution Marching band Vin Scully Do They Know It's Christmas?

more then one acting agent can u have more then one agent for acting in the same city it's entirely possible some actors have multiple agents for various reasons but the main reason is that certain agents only handle certain aspects of a performer's portfolio for instance you may have one agent that only books you for commercials and one that does tv film while another handles stage or music there are pros and cons to this approach of course however if you sign a contract with one particular agent for let's say theatrical work there is usually a provision in th contract stipulating that you will not sign with another agent for theatrical work until after this contract has expired if you decide to go with multiple agents you may want to find an agency that is large enough to house all aspects of the agents you want into one place it'll just save you time running from one agency to the next best of luck  Onion Dehydration Tofu Water Diarrhea Rehydration Acne Hyperthermia Skin Glycerin Prostate cancer Humidity Fluoride Fire fighting Fecal incontinence Hair Eye Nutrition White phosphorus incendiary Cetacea Sulfuric acid Cyanide Condom Common cold Traumatic brain injury Mattress Human physiology Blood Carbon dioxide Aquatic ape hypothesis Motor oil Dieting Personal lubricant Radiation therapy Ceramics Zinc Shampoo Tide Standard enthalpy change of fusion Ammonia Intravenous therapy Water (molecule) Spider Animal communication Riot control agent Tetrapod Stomach cancer Menstrual cup 613 mitzvot Human Elephant Animal testing Gray Wolf Protein-energy malnutrition Kilogram Chocolate Insulin Capital punishment Engine cooling Puberty Rocket fuel Shaving Smoke-screen Siphon Tea Wound Diabetes mellitus Gravity Polychlorinated biphenyl Vulva Tocopherol Crocodilia Nerve agent Hiking Scarification Freeze drying Penis Homeostasis Drinking Paint Milk Lubricant Characters of Naruto Sperm Whale Dialysis Isotope separation Coffee Dairy Uranium Domestic rabbit Scar Devil Fruit Sweating Jon Secada Moisturizer Urinary incontinence Kitchen Vinegar Cantonese cuisine

what can i do to improve auditions for plays i am really into acting and have been a part of a few plays i took years of a high school drama class but it really only offered instruction for short skits speech and placement and i've been taking singing lessons so to the problem i try out for community theatre and don't make it you are probably thinking if she can't make it into community theatre then she should just give up or something along those lines better or worse who knows but i was just so nervous and apparently didn't fit the part and it was a moderately sized community so i tell myself i am looking for tips from people who know what they are talking about what can i do i'm and alto and must really suck help please i've gone through the same thing one good thing is to be confident at the audition even if you have to just pretend that you are confident then it will help your audition begins the moment that you step out of your car they watch everything you do not just your reading or whatever you are doing for an audition you do not suck don't even think about telling yourself that just show up early and make sure that the directors know that you are there look right into their eyes and introduce yourself proudly if someone else needs a reading partner be one of the first to volunteer well that's most of all that i can think of best of luck to you on your next audition i hope to see you in a movie someday d  The Walt Disney Company Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Happiest Homecoming on Earth Walt Disney World Resort Walt Disney Imagineering Hong Kong Disneyland Resort Disneyland Amusement park Hong Kong Disneyland Disneyland Hotel Main Street Electrical Parade Carolwood Pacific Railroad DisneySpeak Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room Disney-MGM Studios Walt Disney anthology series Disneyland Resort Paris Disneyland Resort Tokyo Disney Resort Fantasyland Disney's Animal Kingdom Disneyland Resort Line (MTR) Adventureland Jungle Cruise Big Thunder Mountain Railroad Cinderella Castle American Broadcasting Company Disneyland Park (Paris) Walt Disney World College Program MTR Disney's California Adventure Audio-Animatronics Sleeping Beauty Castle Pirates of the Caribbean Disney Channel Space Mountain Mickey Mouse Walt Disney Studios Park The Haunted Mansion Magic Kingdom Minnie Mouse Carousel of Progress Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh "it's a small world" Monorail Disneyland Monorail System The Standard Splash Mountain Frontierland Disneyland Railroad The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror Epcot Transport in Hong Kong Rapid transit Donald Duck KCAL-TV Hong Kong Police Force Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters Japan Airlines Reedy Creek Improvement District People mover American Dragon: Jake Long Tourism in Hong Kong Star Tours Hilary Duff Walt Disney World Railroad MediaCorp Pixar Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Innoventions Peter Pan's Flight Television network Disney Store Clay Aiken American Idol Fantasmic!

should i believe this lady that wanted to scout me and referred me to a website of this site i dont believe it because she has never met me or heard my talents but she works for an agency and referred me to a site that looks pretty proffesional what should i do well it's like this you probably have a look or the look and whatever that may be the agency has already schooled her on what to look for when she is out scouting so that you will get caught up in the glamour and excitement of being discovered and if they tell you about fees that maybe associated with your discovery you won't have a problem with paying the fee because after all you are going to be famous they may hit you with fees on the site or get you to come to a casting call with 's of other people and then tell you about the fees for photos and the costs to market you etc etc etc i can tell you this because i used to be a scout and it was all just one big scam within a scam i got tied up with wilhemina scouting network which was alledgedly affiliated with lou pearlman who is credited with successes for backstreet boys and n'sync the network trained us by telling us who and what to look for when we were scouting the goal was to get your scouted prospects to casting calls that occured several times during the week and then they would select the people who looked like they could pay the fees if lou's name sounds familiar it might be because the authorities were looking for him and he was found overseas he was just on the news a few weeks ago i saw video of him as he was taken into custody his company has bankruptcy and some other issues and in doing all the work we did as scouts none of us every got paid our discoveries were paying the fees but wilhemina scouting network didn't pay us every time we would ask when is payday they would say in two weeks in to weeks everybody i started working with we all had quit so i say to you if they invite you to a casting call by a scout and it doesn't cost you anything go everyone should go to at least one casting call in their life just to say you did it it makes good practice for when you have a real casting call to attend best wishes  Thelma Houston Diana Ross Michael Jackson God Save the Queen The Star-Spangled Banner Ray Charles John Lennon Billie Holiday Delta Goodrem Tom Waits Elton John I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue The Jim Rome Show Led Zeppelin Cliff Richard Whitney Houston Blood on the Tracks Please Please Me Bee Gees Ella Fitzgerald Avenue Q Fiddler on the Roof U2 (band) Enrique Iglesias The Miracles Sting (musician) Jim Steinman Street-Legal Usher (entertainer) Dalek (Doctor Who episode) Nu metal Hymn Magick Hip hop music Frankie Laine Country music Hey Jude She Loves You Slow Train Coming American Idol Megadeth Porgy and Bess The Beatles On the Road Janet Jackson Harry Nilsson Kanye West Carpenters Tina Turner Bryan Adams Journey (band) Johnny Cash Billy Ray Cyrus Unreleased Madonna songs Witchcraft Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid (album) Whose Line Is It Anyway?

modeling and acting audition tomarrow help hey guys i have an audition for tv acting and for commercial print modeling im really nervous tips of how to act in front of the tv i have only done stage would be great as well as any other helpful tips help help help thank you p s i know this isnt a scam because i have a friend in it who is doing well they do not ask for upfront money and its a agent search i am confident it is not a scam so can you please just tell me audition tips not lectures thank you i am very knowledgeable about scams and about this business just not auditions p s i know this isnt a scam because i have a friend in it who is doing well they do not ask for upfront money and its a agent search i am confident it is not a scam so can you please just tell me audition tips not lectures thank you i am very knowledgeable about scams and about this business just not auditions meeting with a talent agent by tony martinez talent agent congratulations you did it you managed to get my attention and i've agreed to take a meeting that means you get one shot to convince me that my career as an agent cannot continue unless your name is on my list the process is simple first i always meet one on one with potential clients this gives me a chance to really get to know the person if that goes well i ask the actor to come back and meet the other agents it's essential that everyone be in agreement one agent should never try to convince the others to sign someone and that's basically it the only problem is actors tend to be their own worst enemy believe it or not actors seeking representation are always convincing me not to sign them pretty depressing right i'm always amazed by how much effort actors put into getting a meeting with me but none of you ever know how to behave once you're actually in my office before we tackle this subject let's make something clear i want to like you it's my job to sign actors and if you're sitting in my office that means you did something right maybe i noticed your submission maybe someone referred you or maybe i saw your work in a showcase whatever it was something positive happened to get your butt into that chair so don't turn a positive into a negative you've got minutes to make an impression that's seconds you have to use that time wisely so how should you behave in my office well think of it this way meeting with an agent is like a first date you've got two people in a room they're sizing each other up and they're both wondering if it's going to go any further now ask yourself this what's the worst thing you can do on a first date answer talk about yourself there's nothing worse than being stuck on a date with someone who spends the whole night going on and on about themselves it's the same thing in a meeting i tend to tune out actors who waste their time by doing a non stop monologue about who they are and what they want so don't play into the stereotype of the narcissistic self involved actor it's dull it's boring and worst of all it doesn't give me a chance to really get to know you instead walk into that office and create an atmosphere where you can both get to know each other as people i have to forget that you're an actor seeking representation that's boring instead i need to see you as an individual i have to get a sense of who you really are outside the world of show business how do you do this easy try to have a normal conversation maybe there's something in my office that catches your eye or maybe you just saw a great movie whatever the idea is to get into a give and take situation where you're talking about anything but acting this will give me a chance to get to know the real you i once met with a young lady who had tarot card reader listed on her resume under special skills it just so happens that i love anything having to do with the occult so we started talking about it and the next thing you know we're both sitting on the floor and she's giving me a reading as a result we really got to know each other and i ended up representing her for many years now that's what i call a good meeting remember it's easy for an agent to pass on an actor seeking representation we do it every day but saying no becomes just a little bit harder when we've spent minutes getting to know you as a human being and that might just be enough to get you signed as a client  Anne

how can i get my baby into modeling or advertising my daughter is almost months old her father and i arent rich by any means but would love to find a way to earn some extra money to put aside for her future she is just so precious i know every parent says that about their kids lol but she is just adorable where can i go to get her some auditions and such in the maryland area send a snapshot or two to these agents and see if you get a response kids international talent agency east swan creek rd suite fort washington md tel taylor royall agency falls road baltimore md tel they are sag franchised agencies in md and if they are interested they'll call you do not call them just send the photos and a cover letter stating your purpose for contacting them btw babies days and older can work in the industry though twins are most desirable they not the only babies that work legit agents take of your pay after they help get you a job sag contract print agents generally take so if she does modeling the agent may take a larger percentage for that read any contract carefully before you sign and make sure you are comfortable with everything first read up on child labor laws in your state as it pertains to the entertainment industry as an infant there are very strict rules as to working hours etc and as her parent you are her best advocate do not be afraid to speak up if a production crosses the line you are doing what's best for your child good luck  Milton H.

how do actors remember all those lines how is it possible to memorize all those lines and not screw up or forget them different actors work differently some actors use cue cards and prompters all the time they're not memorizing at all of course there's a long tradition of this goes at least as far back as shakespeare when the book holder would be sitting with the script somewhere where actors could get a quick line in live shows professionals will rehearse to an extent that most people can't conceive after living with a script for nine months six days weekly the lines get to be like your right hand then there's also the fact that whatever you do often you get good at a new actor might have to pore over a script and learn the lines one at a time and practice with a partner an old warhorse of the stage and screen can often suck up lines like bounty on a spill i've heard for example that drew barrymore can memorize a day's worth of lines by having an assistant stage manager read them to her during morning make up the human mind's capacities far exceed the demands that most of us put on it  Copyright Crown copyright Copyleft Copyright infringement Copyright law of the United Kingdom United States copyright law Japanese copyright law Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Fair use Trademark United States Copyright Act of 1976 Intellectual property Westlaw Australian copyright law GNU General Public License SCO-Linux controversies Work of the United States Government Collage Copyright infringement of software Article One of the United States Constitution Sony Corp. of America v.

best acting agency in new mexico anybody if there even is one these are all good sag franchised agencies a m agency siringo road suite santa fe nm tel applause talent agency san pedro ne albuquerque nm tel maja agency new mexico inc yale se unit a albuquerque nm tel mannequin agency the san mateo blvd ne albuquerque nm tel o agency th street nw albuquerque nm tel phoenix agency the washington pl ne albuquerque nm tel and do not let anyone tell you that there is no work in nm there is lot's of filming going on there my best friend lives there and he works at the new lions gate studios in albuquerque they are popping up there so it is a good place to start out more about agents talent agents for actors come in two main types theatrical television and film and commercial for commercials there are also dance print and voice over agents who specialize in these fields and signing with one of these agents can be a great way for actors with these other skills to cross over into one of the other areas being with the same agency for everything is called being signed across the board but many actors prefer to have separate agents for different types of work become some agencies might be strong commercially but not as strong theatrically or vice versa agents get information about auditions for roles either directly from casting directors and producers calling them asking for client submissions or from a fax email service called the breakdowns a daily list of roles being cast sent only to agents and managers although there is a black market for this information within the acting community and many actors without representation self submit for available roles which some casting people don't mind others hate and the owner of breakdown services abhors remember actors your agents work for you but they only get of what you make so that means you need to do of the work especially when you are getting started that means always be professional know your craft don't shy away from networking and letting cd producers and directors know about your accomplishments upcoming appearances by sending out postcards know your type and how you fit into the current market and above all make sure you and your agent are on the same page about what kinds of parts you will be submitted for and never pay an agent or manager up front to represent you they only make money when they make you money the plan of attack most agents refuse any off the street drop ins in other words they'll see new talent by appointment only don't bother phoning in for one just yet because without a face you're just another voice and unless that voice is absolutely incredible and the agent handles a lot of voice over work it simply won't get you in instead mail off your photo and resume along with a very special cover letter what makes that letter so special simple prove that you understand how valuable their time is so many people try cramming in their whole hopes and dreams autobiography into the cover letter it resembles a chapter from a novel the agent hasn't the time nor the interest to be a publisher any submission that takes more than seconds to scan through and read will likely be filed in the trash here's a sample of how to keep it short wannabe talent hopeful avenue dreamland bc attn ms a gent please accept my photos and resume for possible consideration of future representation i will contact your offices next week to verify your receipt of this package thank you very much for your time johnny smartguy that's it nothing else just plain and simple the agent even has seconds left to take a quick glance at your photo s and stats now the big trick comes the following week give it a full week before calling in and try to make the call on a tuesday or wednesday when they may be less frantic in the office just call up and say hi my name's johnny smartguy and i'm just calling to confirm you received my photo and resume chances are you'll get a response of the agents will be looking at it or there are no openings right now try back in a few months or even the infamous the agents will call you back if they're interested whatever the response simply answer no problem i don't want to take up your time i just promised i would make sure the package got there okay i don't want to keep you thank you very much for your time pause they'll either be impressed and relieved at the short conversation or they'll be caught so off guard that they'll try to explain further if they haven't said goodbye then just repeat a variation of your previous words always offering them the opportunity to end the conversation and reinforcing that you know their time is valuable they're so used to the can i come in pleading that you've really thrown them for a loop by not asking them for something call the better business bureau to see if any complaints have been made against the agency tips warnings agents making their living by earning a percentage of each job they book for a model do not pay any up front fees to an agent if you're not happy with the number of auditions or bookings you are getting set up an appointment with your agent and discuss what you can do to generate more jobs if the agent lies to you makes outrageous promises or asks for up front money to cover phone calls or mailing expenses on your behalf keep looking legitimate

broadway style birthday party ideas do you have any you've gotten some great ideas choose broadway in general a specific show a time period or even a specific composer sondheim anyone whatever floats your boat i think a fun game to play would be to stick names of characters from one show or many depending on your eventual theme on each person's back and they have to go around and ask each other yes or no questions about who they are if not all of your guests are into musical theatre put out some in your face clues to help them out like maybe headshots with character facts on the back karaoke of course you could hire a dj or rent a machine with music to go with it maybe you could also play name that tune with show tunes try to choose some in advance that the guests will know you can also do 'best impersonation or interpretation of a character' and those brave enough will have to perform for the group the cake can be done to look like a record or themed like a scene from her favorite musical or like curtains on stage with spotlights etc use your imagination i drew up what i wanted on my daughter's cake and the bakery at the grocery store copied it if you want writing that may infringe on copyright do it yourself after you pick it up but leave the airbrushing of tiny hairpsray cans to the pros if you get my drift your daughter's thank you can be a bit elaborate and you can make a mini scrapbook 'program' with bios and 'cast photos' which would be their keepsake she could also include a handwritten thank you for thei attendance and gift of course ala when an understudy is replacing a main performer you would use photos from the dress up props you had for the party including a tracy turnblad wig or whatever you chose to have that went with your theme kids will do anything when hamming it up for pictures we had straight boys putting on feather boas no lie have fun  William Wordsworth William Shakespeare British literature Samuel Taylor Coleridge Shakespearean authorship Playwright Sonnet Irish theatre Romanticism Ben Jonson John Dryden Shakespeare in Love Shakespeare's reputation English poetry William Hazlitt Culture of the United Kingdom Elizabethan theatre William Butler Yeats Irish literature Sanskrit literature English literature English drama History of literature Dorothy Wordsworth Poet Laureate Lake District Poets' Corner Thomas Middleton Kannada literature Samuel Beckett Thomas de Quincey Poetry of the United States English Renaissance Tom Stoppard Writer King James Version of the Bible Ghostwriter Play William Davenant Poetry Robertson Davies Shakespeare's sonnets Samuil Marshak Augustan drama Colley Cibber Hans Christian Andersen Henry Purcell Oscar Wilde Literature Literature of the United States Michael Drayton Stratford-upon-Avon Newcastle upon Tyne Wallace Stevens Lyric poetry London Borough of Southwark Louis Zukofsky Julius Caesar (play) John Fletcher (playwright) Augustan poetry Shakespeare on screen Shakespeare Apocrypha Robert Browning The Golden Ass Adam Mickiewicz Writers' Guild of Great Britain Blank verse Langston Hughes African American literature Yiddish theatre Stratford Festival of Canada Walter de la Mare William Congreve (playwright) Du Fu Wole Soyinka Modernist poetry in English 19th century W.

why would analyzing a script be important to an actor what would they have to know about the play to do well no sarcasm please i die inside every time someone answers sarcastically the period the setting the plot the characters the lines the blocking why does theatre productions go through the process of rehearsals to become familiar with the script call it analysing memorising researching what ever there are so many different things an actor has to know in order to play a part well one important aspect for me both as a director and actor is how the lines make me feel when i read them when i say them i also learn how many different ways i could play the lines or words and which ways are definitely not going to work another thing is words or phrases that i may be unfamiliar with heck i want to be able to say them right otherwise the meaning is lost so i read the script to find those bits i do not understand then i research them reading into the script can also tell you a lot about the author and what they wanted to convey what blocking do they offer if any or do they leave a lot of the interpretation up to the actor what sub plots underlie the overall message plot them of the play what are the possible relationships between the characters i am about to direct a period piece and even for me as the director knowing where we are setting the play the dialogue of the piece ie period language possible character traits or idiosyncrasy's and so forth are just as important as learning the lines these come firstly from the script  Uniform Resource Locator Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway HyperText Transfer Protocol Punk rock Johnny Depp Belo Horizonte Wales Oasis (band) Slash (punctuation) Tyson Beckford Web server Slashdot trolling phenomena PlayStation 2 Unix Web crawler Bill Haley Goatse.cx British Royal Family Bon Jovi Windows Vista The Offspring Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Enya CPAN Image Matchbook Romance 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Tex Ritter Digital photography Domain Name System Wget World Wide Web Tysons Corner, Virginia Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills) Aerial refueling Independent Media Center JPEG Sega Dreamcast Bad Religion New England Jani Lane Toto (band) Common Unix Printing System Ian and Sylvia Domain name Kylie Minogue Photography Scalable Vector Graphics Declaration of Independence (United States) HTTP cookie ASCII art PlayStation Portable House Mouse Francisco Zurbar__n Warez President of the United States Rome Urania (magazine) Original Dixieland Jass Band Wireless Application Protocol Mary Cassatt Session Initiation Protocol V-2 rocket Wallpaper group Mozilla Application Suite Deep Impact (space mission) WebSphere Web cache George Bellows Jaguar (car) Hawaii Hollywood Forever Cemetery BitTorrent Cadillac Henry Hobson Richardson Taunton, Massachusetts Moth Helen Frankenthaler Representational State Transfer Christian Bale Hapa Beijing SAML 3DO Interactive Multiplayer Edward Norton Eurocopter Dauphin Apple II family Jos__ Clemente Orozco Fiftieth United States Congress Rancid Pow__zki Cemetery Xbox Squid cache Popular Science WebDAV Thomas Cole John Loder MxPx International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement

is west side story completely based on romeo and juliet i don't think it completely is i think it has to do a lot with the gang warfare at the time btw facts help more than opinion in this question yes west side story is based on romeo and juliet with the jets representing the montagues the sharks ad the capulets riff is mercutio bernardo is tybalt chino is paris and anita could be friar lawrence butit's more than that it's also about racism and even more about love because of anita's love for bernardo being placed aside for her love nd understanding of maria and her love for tony and then there is that amazing last scene where maria doesn't actually die but it is her living influence and the compassion they all feel for her that trully unites the jets and the sharks and i think the ending in west side story is lmost more powerful with chino realizing what he has done and handing the gun meekly to maria maria staring up at them all while crouched over the body of her beloved as if to ask 'why ' and then threatening them all with a death by hate before collapsing in tears both of them are inccredible plays  Hangul Drama Irony Object-oriented programming Writing system Theatre Musical analysis Postmodernism Unicode Social psychology CPU cache Python programming language Cognitive science Deconstruction Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Play Second language acquisition Chinese character Database Meaning Storytelling Simplified Chinese character Film director Improvisational theatre Socrates Stanislavski System Asperger syndrome Leet Marching band Logic Arabic alphabet Writing Religious Society of Friends XML Semiotics Lisp programming language Philosophy of language A Course In Miracles Philosophy Goodness and value theory Propaganda Music Sign (semiotics) Arabic language Chinese language American and British English differences Theatre director Quentin Tarantino Metaphor Standard Cantonese Speech synthesis Burroughs B5000 Structuralism RISC Actor model Meme Current teachings of Prem Rawat AppleScript Robert Altman Screenplay Cuneiform script Scientology beliefs and practices Past teachings of Prem Rawat Franz Boas Power (sociology) Lighting designer Sociology Aphasia Friends Transactional analysis Donald Davidson (philosopher) Compiler optimization Filmmaking Internet slang Kanji Software engineering Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan Consciousness Discordianism Chinese grammar Perl Modem Computer program Infantilism UTF-8 African American Vernacular English Visual Basic Literature Autism English grammar Biology Daredevil Tom Stoppard Gerome Ragni AmigaOS

what is a literary agent what do they do and where can i find one this is the nicely packaged answer there is more to being a writer than stringing words together even great writers have to do more than write unless you can persuade someone to publish the words you slave over your writing will remain unknown and unread and writing will drain rather than fill your bank account that's where a literary agent comes in your literary agent is the book marketing expert who can sell your crafted words to jaded publishing professionals he or she can turn a manuscript gathering dust in your desk drawer into a published book paying the bills a reputable agent will go to work for you to make sure that your writing pays what it should an agent will give your work a much better chance of escaping the slush piles that threaten to overwhelm the office space of all successful publishers your job which isn't easy is produce writing that an agent can believe in try this link http www writers net agents topic phpsessid af b de fa b dd dc for a list of screenplay agents  Filmmaking Film House, M.D. Motion picture rating system Our Gang The Amazing Race The Walt Disney Company Film director Anime Star Trek Seinfeld The Jazz Singer Richard Cromwell (actor) Internet fraud Surveillance The Internet Movie Database Universal Studios Serial Sharon Tate Starfleet ranks and insignia Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire Superman III Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Warner Bros.

question about rent the musical why does roger call benny's wife muffy benny corrects him and says alison which is her real name i have seen rent many many times and still don't know why i also searched everywhere on google and can't find the reason roger calls her muffy and with an affected accent because he's making fun of the fact that benny married into a upper class wasp ish family mark and roger felt abandoned by benny because he used to be one of them before he married into money which is a point of contention throughout the show muffy along wth other names such as bunny or biff is a very old school wasp y name so he uses it to highlight the class difference  Charmed Humphrey Bogart Knots Landing Whose Line Is It Anyway?

do you have to have more than one voice to be a voice actor so far i only have my regular voice it depends on what you want to do with voice acting if you're looking to do basically commercials full time and if your natural voice fits then your golden but if you want to get into doing movies video games cartoons characters etc you're going to need to develop a few voices your basic reading skills are a must but you need to be able to read several different types manuscript or copy as it's known in the business you need to be able to pick up a newspaper and read it aloud you need to be able to pick up a medical journal and read it aloud lets face it you need to be able to pick up anything and be able to read it aloud here's the kicker you need to be able to do more than just read it you need to be able to speak the words on the paper as if they were your own this is one part of the talent many vo's spend countless hours training to learn how to do some of them learn how and some of them don't therein lies one of the needed talents you need to develop the ability to grab a piece of paper that is sometimes handed to you minutes before you go into the studio dissect it to find it's true message and read it aloud as if the words were flowing from you if you practice and practice and practice and still don't develop the ability then you might not have the talent some of the other talents that certainly help are the ability to act and be funny a lot of people might think they are funny but you need to be funny many of the commercials that are recorded today whether they are for television or radio have some aspect of comedy or comedic acting in them tandem spots tandem is more than one vo in the spot a spot is a commercial generally demand that the actors or voice actors be funny your time is best spent getting professional training from a qualified acting coach for acting and a voice over coach for learning voiceovers a coach will generally know if you have what it takes to advance in either career the third and probably most important is a good voice by good we mean clear listenable articulate and in some way unique one of the biggest misconceptions is that you have to have some sort of dynamic over the top high or low voice to get into the business not true what you need are the abilities mentioned above and a sharp concise speaking ability a very regional voice as in having an accent can hurt a lot more than it helps a very heavy accent or inner city affect will most likely not get you very many calls if that's one of your voice characteristics it's time to start working on getting rid of that accent talent is being able to turn it on or off don't loose it just find a way to turn it on and off it's totally possible to make a fairly decent living even by la standards by doing nothing but voice over work i have several friends that do almost nothing but voices for video games and they are getting booked all the time couple of things i noticed when they were starting out was that the ones who could do multiple voices comic scary announcer etc booked work a lot faster than others having a demo reel and a site where people can sample your work on line was also a huge plus also if you can get in with a manager or an agent that deals with voice over work they can be a huge help as most vo jobs don't get posted to breakdowns the way acting jobs do there are a number of classes and books that can give you tons of information on training and things to take into consideration if this is the path you want to follow though be warned the field of vo acting is almost more competitive than standard acting and quite a bit tougher to break into there are training programs that will range from a few hundred dollars for a basic introduction to a dollar week program a decent site to visit to see what you're up against is voices com the other thing to keep in mind is that once you have your training and you think you're demo ready you'll have to book studio time to record there is no real way to put a price on this because there is no way to tell how long your sessions would take or how much you want to record some industry figures are as show below recording fee dollars duplication fee dollars graphic design dollars cd cost dollars printing cost dollars distribution costs packing postage dollars keep in mind

disney channel auditions hi i am looking for auditions for disney channel shows or movie in minnesota i love to act and want to be ina show thanks for the answers and help disney channel has talent searches occasionally such as this one last november http apsc disney go com disneychannel talentsearch people have been posting the following website however it is not for disney channel auditions it is only for jobs at disneyland walt disney world resort disney cruise line tokyo disneyland and hong kong disneyland http corporate disney go com auditions the disney channel talent search in the uk is just about wrapped up there are no current disney channel open calls scheduled currently the casting of the shows on the disney channel are being conducted through standard industry procedures the locations of casting offices for disney channel productions are not released to the general public these are the casting directors that were used for the seasons of hannah montana carol goldwasser episodes howard meltzer episodes lisa london episodes catherine stroud episodes fyi they do not open unsolicited submissions from actors they only accept official submissions in response to the character breakdowns and only from agents unfortunately in this day and age an actor can't pick and choose if they want to do film tv commercials be on the disney channel or whatever you have to take what you can get anyways i grew up on the same street as actor eric stoltz when he was your age he did school plays but his parents supported him big time and paved the way for him but the big break for eric was when he joined the santa barbara youth theater group it was popular for casting people agents etc to come to santa barbara and see the plays several actors got started there including anthony edwards er kathleen wilhoite and kady huffman tony award winner you should seriously consider joining a youth theater group in your area along with your school theater aside from the obvious things like finishing school and study study study study your craft here is some neat info advice for kids have fun and enjoy every performance learn as much as possible from the professionals you work with get your rest and drink plenty of water be respectful and do what you are asked to do to make the child wrangler's job easy remember you are there to do a job share the experience with your friends and family visit as many places as you can be thankful for the opportunity use your down time to keep up with schoolwork laugh laugh laugh advice for parents respect the word business in show business do not let the spotlights and excitement overshadow that this is in reality a business this is a family commitment have an open family discussion regarding how this commitment will affect your entire family and your present lifestyle you ll need to consider the following how will this affect your family s financial obligations do you have the flexibility to take your child to auditions and accompany him her on bookings who will have responsibility for any other siblings at home how would your family handle the possibility of a theatrical tour or relocation due to a job commitment be honest with your child and make sure he she understands the commitment involved and truly want to pursue a career in show business make certain your child understands that contact with peers at school may be limited and time to devote to social school sports activities will decrease as well auditions are usually after school and there is often little advance warning emphasize that auditions can be as frequent as three times per week and that performing arts instruction will also take up free time also make it clear that booking a job can involve a time commitment of one day to several months and can sometimes include touring or relocating educate yourself about the biz remember this is a business and there is a lot to learn before jumping in head first and for your child's welfare learn as much as you can visit the web sites of the screen actors guild sag aftra american federation of television and radio artists and actors equity association theater for the most reliable and current information all three web sites contain information on child performers in addition a wonderful site for reference material is lawrence parke acting books http www actingworldbooks org books ht never pay money up front for representation legitimate agents managers should never request or require upfront fees for photo shoots or any other type of service upfront fees are illegal in most states you can check your better business bureau for information on modeling talent agencies in most instances fees for the talent agency's services are limited by law to if you choose to work with a manager in addition to an agency keep in mind that managers can charge fees ranging from to which is not regulated by law of course this would be in addition to the agent's commission a must research and know the child theatrical labor laws in your state http www dol gov esa programs whd stat some states may require entertainment work permits if this is applicable to your state your child will not be allowed to work unless a work permit is obtained there are no exceptions if the work permit is renewable do so at least six weeks before expiration to assure a current work permit status some states currently california new york and louisiana also require set aside trust fund accounts information about these requirements can be found on your respective state's department of labor website or by calling to request information by mail your child must be within your sight and sound at all times while working in film tv commercials if there is an obstruction on the set preventing you from viewing your child ask the employer production to please provide a monitor for your viewing this is a union regulation so do not feel intimidated about asking or speaking up if you feel uncomfortable with a situation that will affect your child's safety and or welfare do not bring siblings to set this will distract you from keeping a close eye on the child working keep a diary of bookings and all paperwork contracts pay stubs expenses receipts parking transportation wardrobe pertaining to each booking you may need this information both for residual tracking if applicable and also for tax purposes keep a separate folder for receipts some expenses may be tax deductible if your child has met the financial requirements required for a deduction some possible deductions may include but are not restricted to continuing education with regard to your child's career i e coaching training transportation parking photos mailing expenses wardrobe laundry cleaning union dues and professional dues answering machines pagers cell phones even under certain circumstances theater and movie tickets please consult a financial advisor regarding allowed expenses the bottom line is when in doubt save all receipts beware and proceed with extreme caution when promoting your child on line and using on line casting sites internet safety is a major concern because of child predators if you choose to promote your child through a personal web site never list personal information that would enable a predator to locate your child i e date of birth address home phone number etc use a phone service number or p o box for contact if necessary also keep in mind that a child's photo on a website can be copied and used inappropriately and once it is circulated on the internet it is usually impossible to remove or control if you find it necessary to have a site designed for your child use a professional web site design service that is familiar with web site security the bottom line for your child's safety and welfare a reputable agent manager should be used to promote and procure work for your child not a personal web site keep your child connected with his her peers both from the community and from school to keep your child s life as balanced as possible inasmuch as it is possible find time for meetings with friends for special school events for after school activities for sports birthday parties etc the reality of show business is that a child actor's career can be short lived many successful young actors grow up to find themselves thrown back to reality among their peers either by choice or by chance the way to make this transition easy is never to separate your child from his her pre show business lifestyle and friends education should be a top priority a child's career should never take priority over his her education you need to think long term explain to your child that there are no guarantees that an actor s career will last through his her entire lifetime let your child know that ultimately real world responsibilities must be met and it is important to have an alternative career path just in case set up a meeting with your child's teacher principal at the beginning of the school year to advise the school of your child's situation let the school know that your child is a performer and discuss what this will entail i e frequent absences etc throughout the school year find out what your child's responsibilities will be to make up the educational requirements and what the school s policy is on absences also try to arrange for the loan of an extra set of textbooks to keep at home for use with on set teaching be prepared pack an audition work bag and refresh the contents periodically include a change of clothes grooming supplies snacks nothing messy or sticky quiet games coloring books activity books juice boxes light colored juices that will not stain your child's work permit and social security card your child s set aside trust fund information if applicable your child's birth certificate or passport union identification if applicable your identification license or passport toll money change for parking meters audition diary have this all ready to go at a moment s notice be prepared for education on set if you can get them on loan from your child s school be sure to have extra set of textbooks at home for on set teaching prepare a backpack containing the textbooks school supplies writing materials a calculator notebooks crayons markers glue stick a dictionary and whatever other items your child normally uses to do class work and or homework listen to your child his her feelings about working in show business may not be revealed through words but through actions if the smiles disappear and it becomes a chore instead of a passion or if you see your child balking at auditions and preferring to be with friends it's time to be honest with yourself and your child it may be time to stop and put the biz aside for awhile or permanently be supportive of your child have fun and enjoy the experience  Extreme Programming IBM PC compatible Scientology beliefs and practices Jennifer Lopez Theory of conduct Social rule

are there roles for tweens i have a talent agent but my mm was telling me there are not alot of roles for year olds is that true i know what you're talking about and your mom is absolutely right a few years go when i had first joined my agency i was getting frustrated because there were practically no auditions for people my age however i'm almost and i've noticed that there are much more roles for than for it's based on groups the young kids like then preteens like then young teens like but when it comes to and producers just say what the heck we'll just cast a or year old kid to play or they would rather have someone older that's not a minor and can drive be able to work etc than have a real year old but bottom line is the vast majority of roles that an agent will get are for year olds it also depends on your region since the dallas region needs more year olds that's why my agent is the way it is just hang in there you'll get a real good job eventually and it'll be worth it  Shit Neopets Kate Moss Corporate governance Objective-C Advertising America's Next Top Model Web banner Stuff (magazine) Micropayment Network effect Chris O'Donnell Ken Chu Online advertising Craigslist Internationalization and localization Richard Cromwell (actor) Legal research The Ashlee Simpson Show The Best Page in the Universe Internet fraud Wendy's Care Bears Sanford and Son Craps Team Fortress Classic Rich Mullins Sharon Stone Claudia Schiffer Attack of the Show!

how do you begin acting how do i begin my acting career with no experience in steps please i normally don't answer questions like this anymore because people post about of them each day but yours is very so simple so i will the first thing you need to do is get experience when it comes time for you to take the step to get an agent you will need to be able to show your resume a list of all your experience and you will need a lot of experience on it i always recommend theater as a place to start out because it gives you not only credits that look very good on a resume but also valuable experience as an actor if you can perform live with no problem then everything else is a piece of cake all the best actors get their start in theater and ones that didn't often wish they had so find your local community theater call them and audition for the next play they put on if you are in school join the drama club or the school play once you feel you have enough experience on your resume this can be anywhere from to or years it took me you call up an agent and set up an appointment to join agents are like middle men when a company wants to make a commercial movie etc they notify agencies which in turn tell the actors that they employ this is necessary because it would obviously be impossible for a company to notify each individual actor and just so you know agents do not seek out and discover talent like some people sometimes say you have to contact them and you never have to pay an agent agency anything they only make money when they get you work only then do they get to take of the money you make so if an agent ever asks you for money up front turn around and leave becoming a professional actor takes time but it pays off just make sure you get a good start  Adolescence Teen Titans (animated series) Saved by the Bell Child sexuality Ageing Child Emo Rocko's Modern Life Our Gang Economic inequality Alias (TV series) Child pornography That '70s Show Modelling agency Teen Girl Squad Lindsay Lohan Kodocha Springfield (The Simpsons) Everwood Codename: Kids Next Door Baby Blues American Idol EastEnders Casino Royale (2006 film) Malcolm in the Middle The Empty Child TLC Determinism Fight Club Galaxy Quest Charmed Infantilism Knots Landing Soap opera Shawn Michaels Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Motion picture rating system Hilary Duff Fictional crossover Toronto Blue Jays Sydney Bristow Kimberly-Clark Corporation Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome Television in the United States Halliburton Driver's license Toonami The Inside Independence Party (Iceland) Full House Humphrey Bogart Mind Over Murder Back to the Future Ephebiphobia Principal-agent problem Recurring South Park characters Oakland Athletics New Kids on the Block Mulholland Drive (film) Dallas Cowboys History of SNL:1980-1985 Beavis and Butt-head Extras (sitcom) Outsourcing Age of consent Younger versions of cartoon characters Plame affair Tara Lipinski Lacey Chabert Oldsmobile Cutlass Entropy The Sims 2: University The Suite Life of Zack and Cody Free market Boy band Invincible (comic) Dallas Area Rapid Transit Eric Bischoff Secretar__a de Inteligencia WNNX (FM) Little Britain Parminder Nagra Deadpool Inflation Open cluster Pitaten Sant Thakar Singh Survivor (novel) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Kristin Kreuk Robert Clark (actor) It's Walky!

getting started in acting la and chicago staring absolutey from the begining no agent no formal training where do i start most of the people who ask questions about getting started in acting on television and in the cinema are fans of the shows they want to work on and there is nothing wrong with that but you need to realize that being a fan dose not mean that you should be an employee of the show too many people have the idea that they are going to go to an open casting call wow the casting director and get a spot on their favorite show honestly your chances are probably better at winning the lottery than this scenario ever happening there is no magic formula to follow that guarantees you success if there is this business wouldn t be this hard to get into to but what i can show you is the path to start on if you really want to make a go of this as a career you have to figure out if acting is really what you want to do or if you only want to do it because you are a fan of a particular show or movie or if it s a passing trend would you be just as happy if no one outside of your community knew who you were but you got to act every week at the local theatre or are you after the money fame and celebrity status that might come your way if your answer has anything to do with the second option stop right now and find another line of work start getting training you can take classes in your school all the way through college or if your town offers a professional acting class all the better you have no idea how many people say i love acting and i know i could be great but i have no training and i ve never acted before that s like asking an airline to make you a pilot but you don t know how to fly a plane obviously foolish start with local plays and build your experience any actor worth their trade will tell you that you never stop training read read read read books not only on the art of acting but also the business of acting as well you re never to young to arm yourself with information concerning the business and how it really works later in life if this becomes your profession the information you ve gained will be invaluable you can buy tons of books on line or check out your library once you ve gotten to the point where you ve done the research and got some training you need to get yourself professional headshots and this is going to cost money if you want to be taken seriously as a professional you need professional headshots digital copies from mom s camera ain t gonna cut it nor will photos from your yearbook or glamour shots you will need to find a reputable headshot photographer and hire them to book a session prices usually range anywhere from and up make up artists are extra and will range from dollars extra now you need to get a couple hundred copies made to prepare for your auditions and mailings now a reality check if you want to make a go of this you will need to be in los angeles la is the film and television mecca for entertainment likewise if you wanted to work in theatre you need to be in new york it s just a simple fact that you will need to adjust too how many professional surfers have you ever heard of who spend all their time in iowa after you have your head shots you or your parents need to start submitting to auditions simply put unless you have a very specific look or talent no reputable agent is going to take you on with no experience they need to know that they can sell you and in turn make money if they can t then it s not in their best interest to represent you you can find auditions through on line services such as la casting actor s access and now casting keep in mind that these sites usually charge a monthly fee for their services again this will cost you money up front we never said getting into acting was cheap after you have landed a few jobs you can start to submit to agencies or invite agents to see you in showcases if an agent likes what they see you can structure a deal with them keep in mind that a legit agent will never ask for money up front however they will get at a minimum of your earnings once you ve booked a job tell the agent up front if you have aspirations to work on a certain show of type of film but the reality is you ll have little chance to select the work you go out for initially a good place to start would be the publications put out by wolf press or through http ww sag org so you still want to be an actor actress then you have to be proactive about it do the research find the agents and make the contacts no one is going to do that for you without you paying for it acting as a profession involves long hard hours of training and work possibly thousands of dollars in headshots monthly bill fees and training and that s just to get a chance to audition long answer short get your training read to get yourself informed do plays locally to get experience get your headshots do small parts to build upon to get experience for your resume submit to agents then finally you may have your shot as fun as it sounds and from time to time it is fun acting is still a job you have to respect it and prepare for it just like any other job if you think you can stand in front of a camera repeat a few lines and make millions then stay in school and look for another profession on the other hand if this is really what you want to do and you re willing to make the sacrifice and do the hard work early on we may just see you on the screen before you know it best of luck  Marilyn Monroe World Wide Web Confidence trick Spyware HyperText

how does one become a tv show producer i've been trying to find some meaning to my life and i was thinking what do i like to do and what do i have experience doing so i am trying to figure out what's involved in becoming a tv show producer i have a background in finance and extensive acting skills and i want to do something that combines both but more on the creative side anyone know from experience anything about being a tv producer or any other ideas i'm just pretty fed up with my job hahaha and really only stayed here because i wanted to finish my acting conservatory thanks everyone well what kind of producer do you want to be producers may do many different things some pay for or raise the to pay for a production to do this have a lot of friends with money or access to a lot of money some are actually writers like on sitcoms to follow this path you become a writer on a tv show and work your way up from there get a job in the mail room at a agency like caa or william morris get to know a lot of people in town when a script or pitch comes a long that you like put all your new found contacts to use and get a cast nd crew commited to brining the project to life pitch the idea to every major and minor production company in town and then make sure youa re allowed to stay on as a producer get a job at a production company ageny or as a freelance production assitant and meet a bunch of people who keep giving you better jobs with more responsibility until you have gained enough respect to become a freelance producer i recommend number find a script or a project and raise money from people who have no hollywood experience who you can fleece with promises of untold wealth from their investment make a project that is really good but not quite good enough for anyone to buy in hollywood but good enough to get you meetings so you can pitch new projects sound like a lot of work it is and it is all that while dealing with nasty back stabbing fake two faced and completely selfish people on th planet but that's why you'll get paid the big bucks  Legal research Screenplay Douglas Adams Plame affair Transactional analysis FairTax United States Postal Service The Unquiet Dead Family Radio The Amber Spyglass Computer virus ISBN Surveillance Theodicy Neil Gaiman Real estate broker Screenwriting The Catcher in the Rye Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Food and Drug Administration Optical character recognition Open access Genesis Syphon Filter Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Object-oriented programming Bounty hunter Robert Altman Cuneiform script E-mail spam WFME The Daleks' Master Plan Value added tax National Weather Service Internet fraud Tcl Freedom of information legislation E-mail Paradise Lost Chu nom Gmail Carl Barks Egyptian hieroglyph Typeface The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Scripting language Arabic alphabet Quentin Tarantino Python programming language Fallen angel KFRC Credit score Operation Mockingbird Modelling agency Credit history Adam and Eve ILOVEYOU Chinese character Peter David Barsoom series Cross site scripting Identity theft Melissa worm Kolob Perl Pretty Good Privacy Starsiege: Tribes Interstate Commerce Commission Virgin Mobile Original sin Scientology beliefs and practices The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy cultural references Library catalog PHP Don Quixote W.

major acting problems should i carry on acting i came across an audition for this musical and asked one of the cast whether i can audition or not he said the director does want me to audition and so i did i skipped school just to audition and didnt get the part since i didnt fit the criteria probably since im too young i don't really mind that but the problem is that my mum's favourite celeb also my fave celeb is in the musical also and it's a once in a lifetime experience for me if i work with her too but now since i'm not in it i dont have the guts to tell my mum and what to do with myself just because im this opportunity is let go just like that also my fave celeb has been rejecting all kinds of acting issues etc etc but this is her first and maybe only musical she'll be in i also didnt get a part in another play i auditioned for so how do i tell my mum what should i do should i carry on with this passion for acting or should i find some other passion my mum knows i skipped school btw hold your head high and tell your mum she will understand i myself had to go through the same exact thing over and over before i got an occasional job sometimes the jobs we do not get are the ones we want the most or a loved one wants us to get the most i once drove back to santa barbara after being scolded by the casting director on days of our lives for not being prepared for the audition and it was a contract role that she really wanted me to land she had originally said i have this job on my look alone i had done small roles on the show before but i went in there unprepared and bombed there i was a grown year old man driving down the freeway with tears flowing down my cheeks i ended up quiting acting for over a year before i got a call and landed a decent acting job with extreme perseverance and determination you will get jobs for me they were phenomenal jobs acting alongside of some of the most talented big names in hollywood so don't worry about working with favourite celebs right now that may come for you down the road your mum will be ok with it and she will be extremely proud of you someday ps you can continue and finish school at the same time as you pursue acting just like eric stoltz and anthony edwards did i grew up with them in santa barbara and they were going down to la doing tv commercials and abc after school specials at the same time as going to school and getting awesome grades and they graduated  Actor Pornographic actor Child actor Voice actor Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor Character actor Barbara Stanwyck Canada's Walk of Fame Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills) Ram__n Novarro Acting Academy Award for Best Actress Pen__lope Cruz Julia Roberts Canadian pioneers in early Hollywood Don Adams The Mary Tyler Moore Show Christopher Plummer Marlon Brando Guru Dutt Logie Awards of 1985 Mare Winningham Lauren Bacall Elijah Wood Spencer Tracy Drew Barrymore Sting (musician) Bollywood Emmy Award Kensico Cemetery Cockney British Academy of Film and Television Arts Jack Nicholson Martin Scorsese Golden Globe Award Jane Fonda Johnny Weissmuller Logie Awards of 1990 Police Logie Awards of 1991 Logie Awards of 1992 Henry Fonda Don Francks Holy Cross Cemetery Logie Awards of 1993 Harry Carey John Turturro Black Canadian Hollywood Forever Cemetery Mercedes McCambridge University of North Texas Rudolph Valentino Tony Award Lara Flynn Boyle General Hospital William Powell Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale) Cary Grant Mel Blanc Mary Pickford Erasmus Hall High School Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery Ed Wood, Jr. Hollywood blacklist Lee Marvin Mac Davis 1989 Golden Raspberry Awards Juilliard School The West Wing (television) Peter Fleming Notable figures in Western films Jim Davis (actor) Marilyn Monroe Connie Stevens Juliette Binoche Amadeus Angela Lansbury Helen Hunt Columbia High School (Maplewood, New Jersey) Deaths in 2002 Faina Ranevskaya John Holmes (actor) Don Ameche Irish people January 10 Will Friedle Deaths in April 2005 Hollywood High School Deaths in July 2005 Johnny Depp Baby boomer 3rd Genie Awards Alec Su Dolly Parton Shakespeare in Love Filmfare Award Stella Adler Jimmy Wang Yu Goya Awards

acting problem i want to be a actor but the only thing is im really shy doing stuff in front of a whole bunch of people how can i overcome that and how do i get into acting like do i have to be a model first or what but how do u make it big i can be shy around strangers too i found that getting on stage actually helped when you are on stage and the bright stage lights are on you you can't see the people in the audience unless you are really trying to look at them but you know at some level that they are there and after you've been up in front of them you realize that there's no point in being shy off the stage a lot of schools offer drama classes which are a good place to start if you are out of school look around for local civic theaters that put on small scale performances the civic theaters are open to teaching people the craft and would be a good place to get your feet wet try to find out if there is a drama club or something in your area keep in mind that plays can be a big time commitment especially as the performance draws near  Theory of conduct Make money fast Hey Jude Plame affair God Emperor of Dune Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Little Britain Kim Possible John Lennon W.
