should i present my boss with a weekly productivity log i usually help various co workers on assignments around the office should i submit a log to my boss every week listing my input around the office i just want him to know that i am being productive or should i just continue to keep quiet and do my work when my boss comes over to my desk it's obvious that i am working on something and i am being productive this is not high school why should i provide him with a weekly log my boss did not request a weekly log however my performance review mentioned a problem with prioritizing assignments and meeting deadlines and i don't think he realize how much work i have and why i can't meet deadlines i think if i presented a weekly productivity log will just give him another reason to be bossy annoying and nag the h ll out of me i already feel like i am being watched carefully something like a fish in a fish bowl one key skill that people who advance in jobs have is the ability to understand the bottom line if you have a major assignment that is important to your boss and organization that is a priority over helping co workers with their work when you say that you can't meet deadlines it sounds as if you're saying that your job responsibilites are impossible to fulfill the productivity log is probably not a good idea because it would only prove your boss's point and it would encourage your boss to micro manage you a better approach would be to discuss with your boss the main priorities of the job so that you can get those assignments done first  Dynamic Systems Development Method Anarchism and society Education in the People's Republic of China Rational Unified Process Extreme Programming Information Technology Infrastructure Library Probation officer George W.

can the interviewer ask you your age at the job interview i didnt think they could just wondering the reason i asked was bcoz i was interviewed by women both hot asst and manager both attrctive they asked me my age so i was wondering by the way im years old thats why i asked actually no they aren't supposed to ask you information such as age marital status sexual orientation parental status etc are questions that should not be asked due to job discrimination typically on the application if age is a factor such as burger king or retail it should be noted in the application seeing that they should have already received your application and resume or either one age is a very irrelevant question  Sexual orientation Job interview Gender role Lawrence v.

about my future can you help ok i am years old and i am homeschooled when i finished with this and have my diploma what kind of job should i get then i was wondering how would i save hsould i start off in an bank account write when i get my first check if so what kind of account should i get savings or checking or both if i have enough for them i want to start out right cause my brother wont help us save and we as in me and my mom really want to move out from my uncles house eve tho my dad is a junk man he still give us money to put up and everyone in the family still puts him down but everyone gets it before we have i cahnce to put it in the bank and my bro is the only way we get around so i cant wait for my driver li but no money fro a car i dont want help on my bro i want want help on what so i do for my future so i can be sure that i want end up like this again and i know i shouldnt be carring my mom she should be carring me up to a point in my life and i am not plaining to and maybe give her some money when she asks cause she is good on giving it back to the person but i want to have money to spend when i get up alot i want to do something with stock or something safer but i just need help getting started whn i finish this homeschool stuff going with continental academy now that i am to work for my diploma everyone gets the money my sis bro dad but he good with helping us out so no problem there he is a junk man and can make a killing off it on good dy one time he made nearly thousand dollars off stuff he found put together with his stock pile but my sis neaver pays us back she is dont really know my bro is we give he take and he barly gives back and he lives with us well he sleep here he really dont live here cause he gone all the time even with the description you gave me i still don't know you well enough what area you live in how's the living condition and type of jobs you can get as a diplomat but first thing comes in mind that you're approaching for your diploma is congratulations you're taking a step forward to be qualified for more jobs however have you thought of going to college maybe pursuing some subject that you'd might like and make a career out of it something you like so you don't have to work a low paying repetitive non challenging job that you might not even enjoy it's almost every child's dream to take care and shelter their parents or one of them with a good living making sure that they have enough to eat and proper housing and needs set for good so you should be proud that you're thinking about it i live nearby an urban city but the living condition is low average there's a lot of households that live by pay check to pay check and high in crime rate a lot of my friends in high school held low paying jobs like in fast food industry and convenient stores to help and there are some who are the backbone of the families it sounds impressive maybe and they still want to go to college and all hoping to pursue their dreams they have more challenge than others who don't have jobs while at school but their only income source is from their jobs so they have to work as well i'm not here as a banker to talk you into opening an account but if you're sure that you want to open an account then you should compare don't just pick your first bank because of their mascots or because they give you free stuff do your homework if you browse online you'll find articles that give tips for account starters or first timers to learn about it to find out which one you need checking or saving or you can go into banks talk to a rep and see what they've got to offer you you can do this to compare one bank to another too just don't sign anything that will bind you to them get brochures about the bank and interest and additional fees they charge for transactions the conveniences can you do your billing online do they have a toll free number for how reliable are they you can ask this from people you know or even other costumers you want to move out you want a car and you want a life that's your goals but what's your priorities you should have a priority and then find out how much you need to save to get that remember buying cars also mean buying insurance and gas so do your research about the car too used cars are not the best because some may cost equal to or more than new cars just to fix some of the compartments if they need to about stocks there are many considerations you should be catious about do you know how to do it do you just happen to know that you're dad is doing it and he's doing well and then you want to do it because doing stocks require some research too per se about which companies' stocks to buy and how well they do do you know the procedures besides the transactions there are legal works that you're involved in so get to know them how much of your total money do you want to invest i suggest not to invest all your money just in case the outcome won't occur as expected so set a budget are you good at it it requires some skills alright not just luck or probability in gambling overall your priority comes first may it be getting your diploma getting a job opening an account or buying stocks just focus on one and then do the next if you're focused and not distracted you'll do well in any of them don't think about everything at the same time this won't do anything for you but to stress you out  Mutual fund Insurance Life insurance Bank Poker jargon Microeconomics Annuity Internet fraud Bond Gambling Freeters Credit card Citigroup Economy of

is pay relative to the cost of living in the united states do areas with higher cost of living pay more than areas with low cost of living for example if i made dollars in houston tx and i moved to san diego ca i would have to make to live the same way now i know i wouldn't get but is the pay at least reasonably higher to compensate for the high costs interesting question in general professional highly skilled jobs pay more in higher cost of living areas the reason is supply and demand and the ability of this particular job pool to move where ever they want if an experienced advanced degreed person is needed in a job and the list of available people is limited higher cost areas will offer more than others since the non skilled jobs usually have more supply than demand the difference is smaller if at all a very useful website for your query is linked you can enter a particular job and zip code and get the salary range choose a high rent area and a low rent area for any job category and you can get your comparison  Inflation Supply and demand Unemployment Labor theory of value Microeconomics Publicly funded medicine Progressive tax Insurance Principal-agent problem Flat tax Minimum wage Gross domestic product Airline 401(k) Game programmer Education in Japan Mutual fund General aviation Intelligence quotient Canadian and American health care systems compared Graduate school Professor Deflation (economics) Digital photography Illegal drug trade High-definition television Welding Turbocharger Health care in the United States Economic history of Japan Economics MMORPG FairTax Computer Monetary policy RISC Taxation in the United States Tariff Salary cap Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Transistor Solar power Lawyer Anarchism and capitalism Public transport Economy of Russia Hydrogen economy Capitalism Freeters Debt American individualist anarchism United States Postal Service Education in Portugal Academia Labor-power Capital accumulation Gameplay of StarCraft Real estate bubble Credit card Minor league baseball Efficiency wages Ragnarok Online Medicare (Canada) Education in Hong Kong Wind power Free trade Arbitrage Law of value Gold standard Conscription Life insurance Offshoring Reaganomics Compensation of employees Natural Selection (computer game) Wal-Mart Surplus value Laserdisc Education in Australia Transformer Canadian and American economies compared No Child Left Behind Act Monopoly Cost accounting Hybrid vehicle ZIP Code Broadband Internet access Contract Dog agility United States dollar Philatelic investment Mortgage CPU cache

applying via the company internet site i am searching for a new job every book i have read has listed very low success rates for people who apply for positions online however it seems the trend is to only apply online via the company website or through another venue monster com etc since this is what is required this is what i have been doing since the success rate of applying in this manner is low but it is the process the employer requests in order to be considered how can you turn it around to be successful how do you break through to a recruiter or a live person in the company in order to get your online application recognized applying on line has a few reasons one of the biggest is that when a recruiter presents a candidate to a company that company can avoid the fee since the candidate applied on line even though the company never called the candidate it is a way to avoid the recruiter's fee just like anything else follow up try to contact someone else in the company that has the job you want or at least in the same department see if you can talk 'em up if you are seeking work in a certain industry get involved in various networking groups that attract people from that company or field recruiters for the most part have more out of work or seeking work people if you have strong skills and would be a person in high demand you may be able to get a recruiter's attention however when you are average there is not much a recruiter will want from you i am not saying or assuming you are average i am making a general statement always be professional however if you really want to be hired make sure you are creative and tactical in getting noticed i wish you well  Education in the People's Republic of China Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act MMORPG Graduate school Management Call centre Welding Genetic algorithm Internet fraud Blog Credit card Gas metal arc welding Public domain Transsexuality Microsoft Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Trade union Education in Portugal Baseball Unemployment Apple Computer Computer Single Transferable Vote Insurance America Online Strategic management Affirmative action Professor Expert system College admissions Efficiency wages Keynesian economics Economics Electronic Arts Electronic commerce Appeal Search engine optimization Skype Socialist Workers Party (United States) Labor theory of value Cable television Barrister Florida Central Voter File Software engineering Computer virus Game programmer Independent Media Center Supply and demand Hacker Recruitment ELO rating system Online marketing Unemployment benefit Software patent Paralegal Newbie Human sexual behavior Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000) Mergers and acquisitions Relationship marketing Enterprise content management Employment agency Spam (electronic) Nuclear fusion Paintball Advance fee fraud Glossary of partner dance terms Enron Corporation Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII Outsourcing Broadband Internet access First-person shooter History of the Internet World Championship Wrestling Labour economics Plame affair Alexander Technique The Apprentice 2 Airline E-mail spam Guild Wars Life insurance Freeters Offshoring Professional wrestling slang GED Bank Intelligence quotient Surveillance CPU cache Minimum wage John Lott SAT Vicente Fox Software patent debate Construction Copyright Amazon.com

can i be paid if i left employment after only weeks i am currently working on a month probationary status on my new job and undergoing some training i found a much better job and decided to leave after about weeks though i havent signed any contract with the old job yet are they entitled to pay me by law on those weeks even though im still training with them am i required to work out a certain number of weeks notice this week is my rd week so im about to leave yet so are they going to ask for a notice period first of all it's pretty crappy to leave after only three weeks but you have to do what you have to do right the department of labor determines all the rules that determine pay however if you worked you must get paid as far as the notice goes to be professional you should give a week notice but my guess is they will say thanks anyway and let you leave immediately becasue they don't want to invest any more time or money in someone that isn't there for the long haul a notice is given so the employer has the time to get a replacement but in this case they can go back to their candidate if they are still available just a word though be open and communicate with the company you're leaving it's a small world and everyone knows everyone and if you burn bridges here the word may get around be forthright with them and they'll respect you much more and next time you take a job make sure it's the one you really want  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Minimum wage Article One of the United States Constitution Graduate school Freeters Unemployment benefit Annuity United Kingdom corporation tax National Football League Trade union Education in the People's Republic of China United States Army Life insurance Outsourcing Leasehold estate H-1B visa Unemployment Paralegal Contract Apple Computer Advance fee fraud Working time Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Civil rights Military of Switzerland Short selling Labor theory of value National Insurance Employment British Rail Class 86 United States labor law Wal-Mart Insurance Newcastle United F.C.

when you're at a job interview and the interviewer asks do you have any questions is it see details proper etiqette to take out a notebook and ask questions from there while writing down the answers or should you just memorize the questions you are going to ask the interviewer as well as the answers i don't think it's a bad idea to come prepared with a list of questions but do keep the questions in the back of your mind so you're not reading straight off the list don't be afraid to glance at it though to make sure you don't miss one i learned in college that you can also score points by taking notes but be quick about jotting so you can get back to the actual interview  GED Quizbowl The Apprentice 2 Have I Got News For You The Princeton Review Plame affair Theory of conduct SAT Avenue Q Social rule The nature of God in Western theology Test (student assessment) Love and Theft Whose Line Is It Anyway?

desperately need more hours at work but they're shorting me i hope this is the right place to ask this question so i really need more hours at work and i'm scared to ask for them you see i work a part time job in retail and i leave for college in a week and won't be working there anymore for the time being i asked my boss for more hours a couple weeks ago and he said he would give them to me but i haven't gotten any more hours than usual my work has not been the very best lately so i'm worried he doesn't want to give me extra hours because of that but i really need extra money for school and it's my last chance to work since it's my last week about half the employees are teenagers who're off the schedule this week because of school so i figured they could spare more hours at least but i'm afraid to ask because i'm scared he thinks my work has been bad how should i go about asking him for more hours when i already did and that got no results please help all help is appreciated have you done anything earlier in the season to warrant him not giving you the hours like calling off last minute or not showing up leaving early even if you think that you fooled him with a good excuse this might have an impact whether he said it or not i would remind him of what he told you and explain to him that you really need the time  Shaggy dog story Haven (TNG episode) Poker jargon EastEnders Wheel of Fortune Avenue Q Social rule Unemployment Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Blonde on Blonde Rent (musical) New York Giants 1957 World Series The Apprentice 2 One Tree Hill (TV series) Ocean's Twelve Extreme Programming The Amazing Race Kodocha Pok__mon Live! 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sydney Riot of 1879 I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Fahrenheit 9/11 Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Dead Like Me Humphrey Bogart Saved by the Bell Family Feud Bowl Championship Series Big Brother (USA TV series) Cleveland Browns Singlish GED Hollywood Squares Blackjack Time Out of Mind Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Trapped in the Closet Sin City Hebrew calendar Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Jumping the shark The Inside Neighbours Dilbert Incarnations of Immortality Theory of conduct New York Jets K' Internet fraud Pittsburgh Steelers Saturday Night Live The Joker's Wild Apollo 8 Alex Ferguson Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Only Fools and Horses Past teachings of Prem Rawat Survivor (novel) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Surveillance Honey and Clover Labour economics The Smoking Room John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Babe Ruth Norway national football team Winning Streak Wal-Mart Ken Jennings Big Brother UK series 6 Labor theory of value Jennifer Lopez Boom Town (Doctor Who) 24 (television) The Family from One End Street Fight Club Jeopardy!

can you answer this please ok after you interview for a job and about days later they call of your references to ask about you does this mean they are most likely going to hire you or are really considering you for employment it's definitely a good sign employers don't generally waste effort on job candidates they aren't interested in but don't count your chickens before they hatch you don't have the job until they offer you the position and you accept so keep applying for other jobs good luck  Unemployment Social rule Plame affair Job interview Karl Rove Software engineering Graduate school Exploitation Employment Evan Mecham The Apprentice 2 Civil rights Barbara Boxer Michael D.

why are managers assholes i've noticed that pretty much all managers are assholes why could it be that the job attracts a certain type of person perhaps some people are prepared to do more irksome tasks to make an extra dollar or two you can get good managers though however with the focus on mbo and number cruching managers are bound to achieve certain objectives and get given a hard time by those above them if the stated objectives aren't achieved sometimes going the extra mile to help the customer or doing the job right isn't measurable and therefore not of interest except in a warm and fuzzy way and then forgotten  President (game) Theory of conduct Administration Computer Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Mutual fund Social rule Incident Command System Monetary policy The Apprentice 2 Strategic management Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Adjoint functors Unemployment Electronic commerce Overclocking Supply and demand ISO 9000 Requirements analysis Contract Trust (Law) USA Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Diving suit Labour economics System/34 Solar power Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Procrastination Money Astrodynamics Kyoto Protocol Extreme Programming Asshole The Apprentice 3 Information Services Procurement Library Information Technology Infrastructure Library Arianne Risk management Call centre Gamma ray burst Software engineering Public good Philosophical skepticism Customer relationship management C programming language Psychology Fuzzy logic Corporate governance Adult attention-deficit disorder Make money fast Consensus decision-making Ontological argument Mattress View camera Scale model Poker jargon Strap-on dildo Frame rate Astronomical seeing United Kingdom corporation tax Charles Goodyear Copenhagen interpretation Embedded system Class (computer science) Strategic planning Weight training Drawing Naive set theory Game programming Textile manufacturing Beatmania IIDX Diseconomies of scale W.

new name same 'company' i'm reposting this because my other question didn't get any good answers i worked for a company that within a couple days was about to fire me on false pretense basically 'he said she said' but proved to be a lie almost immediately the management that was attempting to fire me said sorry once they found out it wasn't true and still said i might get fired yes weird they never did anything to the slandering person i was offered another job and rather than dealing with management that was going closer to a lawsuit by their actions i just took the other job and quit without notice years later the company changed management and it's name ie it was bought out i wish to work there again but i don't want to explain my reasons for leaving their former owners my question is will they be privy to the formers owner's employement information i really don't feel like explaining something that can't be verified but i'd like to work there nice answer phillipa gordon thanks i know this is going to sound wishy washy but my answer is it depends often when a company is bought out it retains the human resource records and employment histories of the previous owners so if someone needs to verify previous employment those records still exist however the detail you mention in your post may not be present in those records sometimes the records for an employee's departure are pretty scant e g employee x resigned on nov meaning there's no detailed record of what transpired i think the most likely place for the discussion to arise is in the interview process where you'll likely be asked for you reasons for wanting to return so to speak you can be intentionally vague in your response to this i left to pursue another opportunity but i discovered that this company job is a better fit good luck  Plame affair Slander and libel Theory of conduct Expert system Microeconomics God Emperor of Dune Scientology beliefs and practices Michael D.

interview problem i was asked in an interview about a job that i quit i worked at a catering center for half a year for or hours a week and i wasn't fired but i didn't officially quit either the job required that i frequently call in and request hours and i just stopped asking because i wanted make time for my social life because i was always working on weekends in an interview they asked me about why i quit the job and i couldn't think of a way to make it sound like i wasn't commited or didn't care what do you think would be the best answer when i said that i didn't have time for it with school and my life she asked me why i didn't have time for a or hours as to caitlyns reply don't you think it's possible that circumstances in my life have changed for example my schedule or my income i dont really care if you think i'm really young my question is still relevent and rather than giving me a disortation about how i'm irresponsible you should have just answered the question that i asked you dont need to give me your opinion on how i should be living my life in the future if you dont have a answer for the actual question maybe you should just mind your own business i would simply indicate that the position was temporary employment to increase your income and was no longer necessary most employers will understand that if they ask if you turned in a notice then i would explain that you let them know but since you only got hours if you requested them no notice was necessary  Plame affair GED Extreme Programming The Ashlee Simpson Show The Price Is Right Shaggy dog story Time Out of Mind Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Theory of conduct Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Rick Santorum 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Unemployment Family Feud Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Slow Train Coming The Apprentice 2 Piccolo Junior Saga Labour economics Labor theory of value Sex Pistols Noam Chomsky George W.

best way to call in sick when you're not sick on wednesday morning afternoon my friend is leaving to go to texas we've been buddies for a while but lately i haven't had time to hang out with him or my other friends on wednesday he's taking off and i wouldn't feel right not being there i just finished high school and for now i'm working part time at a grocery store from what i can tell so far they aren't too strict i actually slept in last week because i thought the store was closed when it wasn't and they shrugged it off and just gave me some extra hours but anyways i was thinking of throwing a party for him on tuesday night and then going to the airport with him and some other friends on wednesday morning afternoon i have to work on wednesday i was thinking of getting my mother to call in sick for me while i'm at the airport but what if they ask to speak to me what would be a believable method i asked a co worker if they'd let me off for such an event and she said nah so this is the way i have to go welcome to adulthood being an adult means putting things in priority for most that means not taking off work without a good reason and many times not taking off work even with a good reason your coworker was right this is not a good reason to take off work having mom call in for you is childish if you are taking the time off you need to be the one to take the time off in many workplaces they do not allow anyone else to call in for the employee regardless of the circumstances i'd settle for saying goodbye at the party tuesday night with cellphone email etc there are lots of ways to keep in touch over long distances  Time Out of Mind Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Charmed Cindy Sheehan Social rule Fasting Hiberno-English Ocean's Twelve Avenue Q Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Pitaten The Catcher in the Rye Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin City Humphrey Bogart Shawn Michaels Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Poker jargon About a Boy September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for September Saturday Night Live Carnival Kodocha The Amber Spyglass Theory of conduct Blood on the Tracks Wal-Mart John Kerr Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Friends Customs and etiquette of Japan Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February STS-59 History of Test cricket (to 1883) Good Friday Grandview, U.S.A.

ant tips on getting the job at an interview in selfrigdes or harrods harvey nicks there are some important hidden agendas that you should be aware of be careful in filling out the job application signing cover letters etc especially regarding the size of your handwriting since bold and large strokes are considered signs of someone's vanity and that you are not really a team player because of your own attitude of going your own way often many employers use graphology handwriting analysis as a means to sort out potential candidates noting that major department stores and even peuguot the french car makers uses graphology exclusively as the sole means to screen potential employees so be careful in how you fill out a job application note your posture during the interview try to avoid the shaking or twitching leg syndrome when you are seated and of course do not chew any gum avoid looking away from the interviewer when asked a question respond honestly to a question even if you say i don't know the answer but make sure that you look the interviewer in the eye as you give your response this eye to eye contact is an indication of your truthfulness even though you may feel pressured or nervous during the interview speak clearly and slowly so that your words can be understood make a conscientious effort to lower the tone of your voice so that you sound more mature and not so squeeky good luck  Graphology Social rule Stuttering Plame affair Medical prescription Investigation and the arrest of Dreyfus Traumatic brain injury Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Sharon Tate Scientology beliefs and practices Singapore gay equality movement Muscle Kurt Cobain G-Man (Half-Life) Milton H.

what's the best way to request a sabbatical for education reasons first are you currently working in education usually that's an easier sell than other types of employment if you do work in education it will help if you inform them that you are going to use your time to learn something that will improve your job performance this is the same route i would go if you do not work in an education field however if your company does not have a sabbatical allowance in their personnel manual it is going to be a tougher sell i would only do this if i worked in a company for an extended period of time and have established myself as extremely difficult to replace if there is no policy and you take a leave i would say that you are probably taking your chances whether or not it will work out when you get back  Education in the People's Republic of China Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Manual transmission Redundant array of independent disks Trade union Copyright law of the United Kingdom Tank Sabbatical year (Bible) Education in Japan Compiler optimization Life insurance CPU cache Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Internet Group Management Protocol Workplace democracy GED Community college Apprenticeship Unemployment Microsoft Jet Database Engine Teacher Graduate school Offshoring NHH Pretty Good Privacy Homeschooling The Wedding Present IBM PC compatible Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Ethernet Charter school Military science Infantilism Vickers Valiant Credit card Breastfeeding Wal-Mart Grade (education) Mutual fund NeXT Education in Germany Freeters Buffalo Bills Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Carl Barks Call centre Annuity Btrieve SAT Li Lisan Unemployment benefit Principal-agent problem Computer Leica Israeli Arab Enterprise content management Ashton-Tate Plastic Skateboarding trick Education in Portugal Trinity College, Dublin Outsourcing Freenet M16 (rifle) Alexander Technique Grade (climbing) Cray-1 Skyclad (band) University of Pretoria Digital photography No Child Left Behind Act Charmed Volleyball Spark plug Vickers VC-10 Inflation Hogwarts subjects Star Trek Customizable Card Game Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Airline Classified information M60 machine gun Master's degree Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights PLATO T-72 Toyota MR2 Publishing Common Unix Printing System The Book of Five Rings IP (complexity) Consensus decision-making Academia Combine (Half-Life 2) Education in the Republic of Ireland Trombone Docklands Light Railway Surveillance Novell NetWare Prostate cancer

what are the best answers to these questions in an interview why do you want to change your job can't really say that i hate my manager and she hates me what are your weaknesses you can give many acceptable reasons in answer to the first question better growth opportunities higher income shorter commute etc just don't criticize your former employer or co workers the second question is a tricky one it is unlikely that most interviewers are straining their ears to hear your list of weaknesses they simply want to see how you handle the question some job candidates can get away with an answer like while i certainly have weaknesses i don t believe i have any that are significant to the position as you ve described the position to me i think it would allow me to call upon my strengths if you don t feel you could pull that off name a weakness that is first not closely related to the position for which you are interviewing and second a technical skill that you can easily learn rather than a shortcoming in your personality which is very difficult to change then tell the interviewer how you are working to improve your weak spot peace and blessings  Economic inequality Social rule Plame affair Species Meaning of life Password SAT Milton H.

is the penn foster career physical therapy aide worth it is it like going to regular school what about handson i was wanting to do this but i don't know if it would be worth it would i be able to get a job anywhere and what about the hands on experience is there anyone out there that know about this schooling and is it worth it please i need advice thanks while i commend physical therapy aides for trying to make the job more professional the fact of the matter is that it is really a job which one can learn on the job the function of aides in most states and settings is so restricted anyway that often their jobs are primarily just to help the pts and ptas under direct instructions and complete clerical tasks such as clean the gym answer phones file etc they rarely have any one to one contact with a patient therefore i feel that this is not a job that requires any formal training or certification i think schools are designing these programs are trying to lure students into thinking that it's an easy way to transition to a pta or pt degree when it really isn't they also greatly inflate the expected income of an aide most students come out of the aide training program finding that there are very few aide jobs and that most pay about and hour i think these trade schools are out just to take your money we have a large facility with four different rehab departments med surg ip rehab op rehab and day rehab and we only employ full time and part time aides when the rest of our staff has reached over in pts ptas ots otas and slps we have one aide who really makes somewhat of a livable salary but he's been doing it for over years the rest of our aides learned everything they need to know with on the job training i would just apply without any formal training and only if you find they specifically are looking for it would i seek a formal educational program or better yet if i was going to invest the time to become an aide months to a year i would just stick it out another year for the pta degree and nearly double your opportunity and salary  Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Nurse Paralegal Game programmer Education in Hong Kong Tai Chi Chuan Professor Ambulance Medicine Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Student loan Inflation Community college Mach kernel Plame affair Education in Australia Apprenticeship Scientology beliefs and practices Quizbowl Alexander Technique Separation of church and state Psychology Reiki Lawyer Software engineering Education in Germany College GED Education in Japan XML Social rule Unemployment Unemployment benefit Minor league baseball Academia Teacher Columbia University Psychotherapy Economic inequality Education in Romania First aid Baseball Division of labour Education in Malaysia St. John Ambulance National Kidney Foundation Singapore Physician Conscription Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Computer Management information system Juris Doctor Outsourcing Clinical depression Education Poker jargon Stuttering Autism Alternative medicine Social Security (United States) Chinese University of Hong Kong Legal aspects of transsexualism Barrister City and Guilds of London Institute Chiropractic Education reform General practitioner Angioplasty Emergency Medical Services Canadian Senate Charles William Eliot Microeconomics Weight training Air traffic controller Great Teacher Onizuka Education in the Republic of Ireland Anti-intellectualism Taxation in the United States Economy of Africa Paramedic Warren Buffett Massage Boy Scouts of America Tuition Hyperinflation Dentistry University of Pretoria Trade union Teaching English as a Foreign Language

why would they want to get rid of me job related question this is a mini continuation of a previous job related question at the end of this week i saw my schedule go from to under next week i spoke to someone at work and they said in a round about way that if we are not constantly after customers greeting them at the door and following up if they need help and this is not done we will not receive the many hours we want and deserve this individual did not say these things in exact terms but i can still infer the point they were trying to get across my problem is that i have been a great employee always coming to work on time when schedules have changed or hours have been altered i have never made a peep about it is what this person doing legal and also how can this idividual being a brand new employee be able to do this even though they are one of our upper managment people in our shop i think they just wants to get rid of me just because they do not like me for no reason i can think of as a side note i have stayed there in order to make some money while i am sending out resumes in an area more toward my preferred field i think what bothers me about this is new managment just waltzes in and wants to change everything that associates are used to i realize the biggest concern is making the company money but why vilify the associates that are willing to go above and beyond and never complain it is also frustrating that they tells me i know you have a very flexible schedule and are willing to work anytime i felt like saying to person listen you stupid idiotic but i have too many manners for that please do not take any of it seriously not only it is just a work place where people are not friends but also think about what you're doing doesn't sound like your end goal job if you know what i mean becasue you sound like a smart man bottom line find a better job or stay where you are just don't take all the stupid politics personally look what you're wasting your precious time on just read what you wrote from above as an outsider you're dealing with bullshit i'm just trying to tell you who cares what they think about you when the kind of work you're doing is open the door and greet in other words it's almost like if they don't want you they're doing you a favor you know what i mean good luck my friend  Shit Poker jargon Expert system Phaedo Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Apprentice 2 Friends Dilbert Legacy of Kain Theory of conduct Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Scientology beliefs and practices Video game developer ITV Transsexuality Sin City Shaggy dog story Jumpstart 3rd Grade Rent (musical) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Garfield Philosophy of language Unemployment Education in the People's Republic of China Transactional analysis English grammar Gender-neutral language Sydney Riot of 1879 Euphemism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sabbath Customs and etiquette of Japan Singlish Evan Mecham Freeters Surveillance Blonde on Blonde Avenue Q Economic inequality Extreme Programming Timpani Lie Humphrey Bogart The Critic The Price Is Right Health insurance Newcastle United F.C.

second thoughts about career i'm studying an early childhood teaching degree and i think i made a mistake by choosing this career my parents put a lot of pressure on me to study for a career that has reasonably good pay and when i suggested either art or working with animals they both almost forced me against doing either of them because they are not such secure jobs my parents also payed for the fees which was a selfish mistake on my part which means whenever i have suggested changing they say that i will waste all that money they spent on me i feel quite unhappy that for the next year and a half and more since i will have to save up some money i will be wasting my life doing something that i just dont want to do i feel stuck in a rut and i am unhappy most of the time i can't even be bothered going to lectures half the time because i just have no passion for what i am doing do i stick to it for another year and a half or should i change now i suggest that you sit down lay down the facts first then on what you feel then you have a talk with your parents and tell them that you dont enjoy teh course you are taking anymore and then point out all the good things if you will follow the course you dictate of course you do know you have to support yourself since i do think that your parents will withdraw theirs  Pitaten Education in Germany Avenue Q Graduate school About a Boy Freeters Characters in the Smurfs Friends George Costanza Mary Astor The Amber Spyglass Parasite singles Divorce Transactional analysis Ludwig Wittgenstein Anger management Capital accumulation Blood on the Tracks Hikikomori A Course In Miracles The Catcher in the Rye Inflation U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Rudolf Hermann Lotze Aesthetic Realism Happiness Education in the United States Ten Commandments Church of Christ, Scientist Carl Barks The Apprentice 2 Milton H.

i gave my ssn when applying for duane reade online will it be stolen i filled a job application for duane reade online and it wanted my ssn to do a background check criminal records and such so i gave it to them does anyone think my ssn will be leaked out i'm scared what happens if it does what should i do the application was almost certainly done on a secure website with encryption i'd say that you are probably safe but today you can really never be too careful remember that you can request a free credit report from each major agency once per year the three major agencies are equifax experian and transunion all you have to do is call them and ask once you receive your report review it carefully for anything unusual which would tip off attempts at identity theft ask a different agency for the report every months so you can see your credit report times each year  TransUnion Social Security number (United States) Experian Plame affair Background check Credit score Internet fraud Surveillance Debt consolidation Public-key cryptography Computer virus Credit card Credit rating agency Phishing Data Encryption Standard W.

hi i completed my mba yrs back i have not been working but now i would like to hi i completed my mba in finance yrs back i have not been working but now i would like to but i cant remember a single thing i learnt i am thinking of doing a small course or something like that online but dont know what direction to go will somebody help me with this i don't think you will be asked to take tests to verify your academic knowledge at the job interviews so i don't see any needs for you to take additional courses at your job if you ever need to check something you can go back to your old textbooks or ask your colleagues you will not be handling the job alone and people will support you so no worries although the potential employers will not probably ask mba test like questions they will probably ask what you have been doing after completing your mba that i think you need to prepare if you are looking for a job start sending your resumes and accepting the interview opportunities even if the company or its business is not something you have in your mind you can turn them down at any point and even if they turned you down you only applied to get the feeling of the interview so pls don't get discouraged that will give you a lot of hands on information to achieve your goal best of luck  Master of Business Administration Strategic management Social rule Graduate school Master's degree Babson College Scholarship GED Extreme Programming Academia Plame affair Education in the People's Republic of China Philosophical skepticism Theory of conduct Milton H.

does anyone has a upstairs neighbor from hell my upstairs neighbor is the neighbor from hell she puts tile floors through out her condo and walks around all day and night with heels on tile offers no insulation from noise i have spoken to her written her notes about the noise but nothing works she drags the furniture on the floor and drops things on the floor all hours of the day and night she is a older woman living alone i expected her to be in bed by pm instead she is like the living dead up all night and day slaming the cabinet doors for minitues non stop i have not taken a vacation because i don't travel and the thought of being home everyday listening to her noise is unbearable i can't afford to move and i like the location it is convenient i tried to be friendly and cordial to her but the noise continues any ideas if your building has an hov you may want to look into the rules and make sure when the upstairs neighbor installed the tile flooring she also took steps to have the floor properly sound proofed the building i live in has this requirement you could also bring it up at the next homeowners association meeting if you have a homeowners association if however you don't have either of those options then a shoe wrapped in a plastic bag pounding on your ceiling her floor everytime she makes too much noise works well you can also try a stereo speaker pointed at the ceiling and placed as close to it as possible turned up extremely loud helps too when she's clunking around in her high heels try going up knocking on the door and just looking at her then down at her shoes back at her face with a little bit of a crazed look in your eyes and asking if she could at least take her shoes off while walking around can often get the point across the main thing is fight fire with fire she makes noise you make noise right back at her if she comes down and complains to you about the noise you're making play dumb and say i have no idea what you're talking about or blame it on the neighbor next door avoid getting into any type of confrontation though otherwise she could claim you're harrassing her  Stairway Sin City Shoe Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Customs and etiquette of Japan Sento Shaggy dog story Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Social rule Milton H.

any actuaries i'm years old and currently work full time doing clerical work for the state of new jersey and go to school full time at my local community college i'm quickly approaching the point where i have to decide on what school i'm going to transfer to once i get my associates degree i was thinking about leaving my full time job and seeking part time employment when i transfer to another school of course leaving my job and taking out loans is a huge financial risk seeing how i live on my own for this reason i'm looking for a stable career with good prospects that i actually enjoy i have excellent people skills and solid computer math skills so a friend recommended i look into actuary science can anyone give me some general advice what courses do i need to take do i need to change my major or can i just take the exams on my own at what point in my college career do i take the exams is actuary work any fun any information advice would be a big help i cut and pasted the following from the source i think it answer your questions applicants for beginning actuarial jobs usually have a bachelor s degree in mathematics actuarial science statistics or a business related discipline such as economics finance or accounting about colleges and universities offer an actuarial science program and most offer a degree in mathematics statistics economics or finance some companies hire applicants without specifying a major provided that the applicant has a working knowledge of mathematics including calculus probability and statistics and has demonstrated this knowledge by passing one or two actuarial exams required for professional designation courses in economics accounting finance and insurance also are useful companies increasingly prefer well rounded individuals who in addition to having acquired a strong technical background have some training in liberal arts and business and possess strong communication skills in addition to knowledge of mathematics computer skills are becoming increasingly important actuaries should be able to develop and use spreadsheets and databases as well as standard statistical analysis software knowledge of computer programming languages such as visual basic also is useful two professional societies sponsor programs leading to full professional status in their specialty the society of actuaries soa administers a series of actuarial examinations in the life insurance health benefits systems retirement systems and finance and investment fields the casualty actuarial society cas gives a series of examinations in the property and casualty field which includes fire accident medical malpractice worker s compensation and personal injury liability the first four exams in the soa and cas examination series are jointly sponsored by the two societies and cover the same material for this reason students do not need to commit themselves to a specialty until they have taken the initial examinations which test an individual s competence in probability calculus statistics and other branches of mathematics the first few examinations help students evaluate their potential as actuaries many prospective actuaries begin taking the exams in college with the help of self study guides and courses those who pass one or more examinations have better opportunities for employment at higher starting salaries than those who do not after graduating from college most prospective actuaries gain on the job experience at an insurance company or consulting firm while at the same time working to complete the examination process actuaries are encouraged to finish the entire series of examinations as soon as possible advancing first to the associate level with an asa or acas designation and then to the fellowship level fsa or fcas designation advanced topics in the casualty field include investment and assets dynamic financial analysis and valuation of insurance candidates in the soa examination series must choose a specialty group and health benefits individual life and annuities pensions investments or finance examinations are given twice a year in the spring and the fall although many companies allot time to their employees for study home study is required to pass the examinations and many actuaries study for months to prepare for each examination it is likewise common for employers to pay the hundreds of dollars for examination fees and study materials most actuaries reach the associate level within to years and the fellowship level a few years later specific requirements apply to pension actuaries who verify the financial status of defined benefit pension plans for the federal government these actuaries must be enrolled by the joint board of the u s treasury department and the u s department of labor for the enrollment of actuaries to qualify for enrollment applicants must meet certain experience and examination requirements as stipulated by the board to perform their duties effectively actuaries must keep up with current economic and social trends and legislation as well as with health business finance and economic developments that could affect insurance or investment practices good communication and interpersonal skills also are important particularly for prospective consulting actuaries beginning actuaries often rotate among different jobs in an organization to learn various actuarial operations and phases of insurance work such as marketing underwriting and product development at first they prepare data for actuarial projects or perform other simple tasks as they gain experience actuaries may supervise clerks prepare correspondence draft reports and conduct research they may move from one company to another early in their careers as they advance to higher positions advancement depends largely on job performance and the number of actuarial examinations passed actuaries with a broad knowledge of the insurance pension investment or employee benefits fields can rise to administrative and executive positions in their companies actuaries with supervisory ability may advance to management positions in other areas such as underwriting accounting data processing marketing and advertising some actuaries assume college and university faculty positions

what should job should i do ever since i was little i wanted to be a vet now that im older though i have been thinking about other carrers that work with animals like wildlife rehabilitation or working to help animals that have been abused and persecuting their neglectful owners i still want to be a vetrinarian but im worried that i wont be able to deal with the blodd would i get used to it give me your opinion i would say you definitely should look into other options if the sight of blood makes you queezy i would give the wildlife rehab centers in your area a call tell them you would like to come in for an 'informational interview ' let them know your age and tell them you are looking at careers they will likely let you come in and talk to them about the possibilities not at their company perhaps but at the industry in general also you might want to apply for a part time job where you would have the opportunity to work with animals even if you are just doing clean up work exposure in the area you are interested in is always helpful and will be even more helpful in the future good luck hope this helps  Social rule Pet skunk Prostate cancer LiveJournal The O.C.

can you ask for the empoyer to show his resume on the first interview after landing a personal interview with your propesctive employer is it ok to ask him ot show his resume this is because a lot of people in construction tend to do a little bit of extra marketing even though they might not have performed those projects and there are so many new companies coming up that is my reason do you mean you want them to show you a portfolio of the work they have done if that is what you mean then i would think this would be appropriate however it would not be appropriate to ask to see someone's personal resume you should also do some research online about the company before you interview and you will likely find the work they have done in the past then you have something to ask about at the interview  Institutional fund management Social rule Statistical survey Super Mario 128 Intelligence quotient Strategic management New Coke Finance IBM Steve Jobs Economic inequality The Apprentice 2 Michael Milken Product Lifecycle Management Privatization Politics of the People's Republic of China Computer Sexual orientation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mergers and acquisitions Annuity Mutual fund Modern portfolio theory Marketing research Management information system Seymour Cray Central processing unit Corporate governance CPU design Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Diversity America Online Google Surveillance Sociology Transmeta Soundbite Manitoba Hydro Portfolio Freeters Supply and demand Podcasting Airline Warren Buffett Health insurance RISC Qualitative marketing research Corporate finance Relationship marketing Electronic commerce Montgomery Blair High School Margaret Mead The Mary Tyler Moore Show Interview Incentive Online marketing Animal Liberation Front Economics Diseconomies of scale Experiential education Graduate school Hewlett-Packard Ken Jennings Job interview Randi Rhodes John Peel BAE Systems Bulgarian language Management Modelling agency Open access Supercomputer Land use forecasting Brand management Tesco Cray Inc.

should salary be based on performance or years of experince and why salary is based on experience in jobs where a mistake can cost the company much in terms of time reliability quality and client relations experience is valued because the knowledge the employee holds is difficult to replace experience is also a factor in determining salary when the job demands results in more areas than just bottom line profit to the company or organization salary is based on performance when results of the job can be easily measured specific goals are either met or missed the company sets out a list of things it wants to accomplish and the employee is rewarded for making those objectives both performance and experience are used in determining most salaries sometimes bonuses are awarded on top of a base salary if specific performance is achieved this gives the employee a base amount of money plus additional incentives to keep him focused throughout the year the trend today is to increase accountability of every employee more and more specific goals are assigned and the employee is tested and judged on his specific performance as occupations change in scope and nature due to new and changing technology or different business practices performance becomes more important than experience in some ways in some companies and organizations older systems are being dropped or changed dramatically the employee must be able to adjust and accommodate the new system to the point that an employee's prior experience can sometimes be an hindrance rather than an asset in cases such as these the company will reward experienced employees whose skills will transfer easily to the new operating system also employees who can draw on their experience in problem solving management negotiation and client relations will be rewarded with a higher salary  Monetary policy Microeconomics Inflation Strategic management Management Principal-agent problem Unemployment Outsourcing Information Services Procurement Library Gross domestic product Education in the People's Republic of China Economic inequality Economics Requirements analysis Privatization Extreme Programming Mutual fund Salary cap ELO rating system Political economy Information Technology Infrastructure Library ISO 9000 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Expert system Insurance Intellectual property 401(k) U.S. generally accepted accounting principles McKinsey & Company Criticisms of socialism Corporate governance Graduate school Credit card Institutional fund management Compiler optimization Strategic planning Software engineering Capital accumulation Tax Keynesian economics Salary Productive and unproductive labour Offshoring Consensus decision-making Welding Rational Unified Process Surplus value Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Investment bank Exchange value Reliability engineering Organic composition of capital Management information system Taxation in the United States Efficiency wages Relationship marketing Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Intelligence quotient Health insurance Contract Mathematics Theory of the firm Game programmer Life insurance Labor theory of value Central processing unit Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Marketing research Psychology Progressive tax Bretton Woods system Enterprise content management Service Species Debugging Incentive Cost accounting Electronic commerce Second language acquisition Employment Supply and demand National Football League Network effect Asset Final Fantasy XI Goodness and value theory Redundant array of independent disks

what are an employee's rights in the workplace a co worker resigned from an over demanding position which required her to do a two person job she asked for assistance did not get it so she resigned it was becoming too much for her and the company did not want to give her a raise or hire extra staff the company has a hiring freeze and expects other people in the department to pick up the slack for the next six months they do not intend to hire extra staff soon is this fair to the other employees do these employees have a right to demand compensation for taking on additional responsibilities if yes what demands are reasonable should these employees start sending out their resumes if no one seems to be listening it might or might not be fair but it's definitely legal interesting that you say they gave her too much for her to do and wouldn't hire extra staff or give her a raise so you are saying it would be possible for her to do the extra work but only if she got a raise no employees do not have the right to demand extra compensation for taking on additional responsibilities except if they are required to work overtime they must be paid for overtime but if they just goof off during their normal day so they have to get overtime hours to get the work done they still have to be paid the overtime but can get fired if someone is not satisfied with their working conditions then yes they should look for another job but many employers have or are cutting back and expecting more from their employees so don't be real surprised if the same thing happens again at a new place  Overtime Education in the People's Republic of China Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Unemployment Employment in Hong Kong Labor theory of value Trade union Plame affair Salary Wal-Mart Working time Paralegal Compensation of employees Eight hour day Insurance Employment Electronic Arts New York Jets Social rule Labor-power Keynesian economics Rick Santorum Termination of employment Air traffic controller Workers' compensation Transport Workers Union of America Efficiency wages Workplace democracy Public domain Affirmative action Management National Kidney Foundation Singapore Michael D.

interview at hollister on tuesday i was wondering if it would be inappropriate to wear a jean skirt it's not too short but i was planning to wear flats and a hollister polo as well i'm so nervous it's a group interview a jean skirt and polo are fine just remember hollister doesn't sell black so don't wear any of it they also want natural looking people so little if any make up and no flashy jewelry just be confident and you'll do fine make sure you stand out from the rest of the group though they're looking for outgoing people who are loud enough to talk over the music in the store to customers then again don't yell in your interview  Abercrombie & Fitch Co.

when is it acceptable to ask for a prospective employer to reimburse your expenses i have been going thru a long drawn out job interview process with a private company that is in my town i have about or so hours invested bucks in parking and approx miles on my vehicle going to interviews most likely will have at least one more trip another miles to see them before getting a job offer if they offer me the job should i ask for reimbursement only if i do not get the job or ask whether a get the job or not what's the norm besides that most companies don't go through such long drawn out process before hiring you won't be able to be reimbursed for your expenses from this employer you can ask but they're not entitled to do so instead what i suggest you do instead is save up this information and all expenses and claim it on your taxes as a deductible expenses incurred in the course of searching for a new job can be a deduction against your taxable income you can deduct certain unreimbursed expenses you incur in looking for a new job whether or not you are unemployed at the time of the job search and whether or not you land a new job you cannot deduct job search expenses if you are looking for a job in a new occupation or there has been a substantial break between the ending of your last job and your looking for a new one or you are looking for a job for the first time if you pass the cannot rules above then you can deduct employment and outplacement agency fees costs of typing printing and mailing copies of your resume phone and fax expenses including long distance calls to prospects travel and transportation expenses if you have to travel outside your home territory to look for or interview for a job if you drive you can deduct the standard mileage rate which changed during the year to reflect the increased price of gasoline miles can be deducted at the standard mileage rate of cents per mile if you need more info go to irs gov at least this way you can decut all of your job hunting fees and not just this employer hope this helps  Taxation in the United States 401(k) Auto insurance Social Security (United States) Flat tax FairTax Tax Gross domestic product Wal-Mart United Kingdom corporation tax Microeconomics Life insurance Unemployment benefit Mutual fund United States Postal Service Health savings account Food Stamp Program Credit card Student loan Public transport Toll road Inflation Progressive tax Taxicab Unemployment Labour economics Interstate Highway Hybrid vehicle Indian Railways Self-employment Advance fee fraud Fuel efficiency E85 Warren Buffett Surplus value Sport utility vehicle Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Centrelink Income tax Enterprise content management Education in the People's Republic of China Mortgage Economy of the Republic of Ireland Depreciation Compensation of employees Capitalism New Deal Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ford Motor Company Income trust Alcohol fuel Tax deduction Capital accumulation Economic inequality Biodiesel Economy of the United States Hummer H2 Personal rapid transit Social Security debate (United States) Efficiency wages United Airlines Digital photography Tennessee General Assembly Road-rule enforcement camera Primerica Financial Services Reaganomics Spam (electronic) Annuity Outsourcing MetroCard Mac OS X Hyperinflation Battery electric vehicle Filling station Unemployment types Variable universal life insurance Karl Rove Bay Area Rapid Transit Graduate school 50 Cent Automobile Cerritos, California Light rail Minimum wage Child support Labor theory of value Internet fraud Euro Principal-agent problem Food and Drug Administration

accounting or paralegal studies which one should i major in i'm trying to decide whether i want to major in accounting or paralegal studies i'm interested in both fields the accounting program at my school is a bachelor degree program where as the paralegal program is just an associates of applied science degree at this point the accounting program would only take me more semesters the last one being part time where the paralegal program would take me more semesters it seems there is a greater demand for accountants as far as i can tell plus more room for advancement and i'm sure both careers have a good amount of stress with them i appreciate any advice you can give me thanks so much figure out which one you are a little more interested in right now and perhaps find a summer job or internship in an office connected with that field that would give you a better idea of what the job would be like if you find it's not what you expected then the next summer find a job or internship in the other field then you will have better knowledge of both and can decide for sure what to major in you can always switch majors if necessary it might take you a little longer to complete school but at least you will make a more informed decision another option is to volunteer this summer at each type of office talk to the office manager and tell him her why you want to volunteer most people will understand wanting to know more about career choices before committing good luck  Paralegal Education in Germany Medical school Graduate school Lawyer Education in the United States Juris Doctor Physician Cooperative education Education in the People's Republic of China American University Intern Professor Chinese University of Hong Kong Far Eastern University Software engineering Walt Disney World College Program University of Maryland Baltimore County Education in Portugal Education in Romania Master's degree Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Dentistry Librarian Georgetown University Northeastern University, Boston Baseball Labour economics Supply and demand Jewish studies Outsourcing Architect Law school Education in Japan Anarchism and society Economics GED Decision making Ethics Plame affair Expert system Science Psychology Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Massachusetts Institute of Technology Chiropractic Academia Hampshire College Associate's degree Community college Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Florida Institute of Technology One Tree Hill (TV series) Education in Canada Seneca College Kwantlen University College City and Guilds of London Institute Computer United States Air Force Academy Cornell University University of Hawaii at Manoa Unemployment Management information system School for International Training University of Scranton Bologna process Lyceum of the Philippines Student loan Microeconomics Education Consensus decision-making No Child Left Behind Act Annuity Experiential education Education in Austria Simon Fraser University Scientology beliefs and practices Stonehill College Mathematics LiveJournal Free will Master of Business Administration Corporate governance Prostate cancer Pitzer College Social rule Pharmacist Emerson College MapleStory Open access Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Athabasca University Jayson Blair Education in Australia University of Southern California Management Babson College Efficiency wages

i have a question dealing with business right now i am currently attending college and going for a bachelor's in either management or marketing i haven't decided yet but i do know that i want something in the business field i want a high paying job and i know that there is high demand for people in business what can i do with either management or marketing i'm just really confused about what there is out there i don't know where to start and i need help to put me on the right track should i stick to management or do marketing or in that case should i just go into another field instead of business i just want a good future with a high paying job so i can settle down and work toward that goal please someone tell me what good jobs are out there i know i sound desperate but this is my future and i need help thank you in advance honest answers will help me a lot peace ideally speaking you should be doing what you are passionate and interested in have you tried taking up an attachment to see if you are interested in management or marketing my advice to you would be to disregard the starting pay for whichever discipline you are going to take up the high pay will come if you have proven your ability in your job the more important factor is your interest and whether you have the stamina and capability to take up that particular industry after which the next most important will be the company you choose to work in the first company is always the most important because that will determine if you like the industry and whether your ability can carry you far in that industry the high pay will come if people recognise your ability  Supply and demand PE ratio Graduate school Economics Theory of conduct Extreme Programming Strategic management Corporate governance Trademark Tariff Corporate finance Requirements analysis The Apprentice 2 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Unemployment Trade union Labor theory of value Free trade Coercion Baseball Institutional fund management Academia Monetary policy Outsourcing Consensus decision-making Political economy Lord Chancellor Education Prices of production Education in Japan Inflation Publicly funded medicine Privatization Apple Computer Bond Computer and video game industry Microeconomics New York Giants Anarchism and society Product Lifecycle Management Current teachings of Prem Rawat Ethics Commodore International Capital accumulation Insurance Efficiency wages Education in Portugal Predestination Intellectual property Financial analyst Anarchism and capitalism Plame affair Capitalism War Management Halting problem Vanity press Offshoring Education in the People's Republic of China Call centre Roxette Enterprise content management Bretton Woods system United Kingdom corporation tax Social rule Pharmaceutical company Electronic Arts Lawyer Newcastle United F.C.

need to make a resume does anyone know any good sites to help me out a resume is a concise summary of all the information about us education work experience achievements and other personal details that will interest an employer although our prospective employer will read our cover letter before our resume the letter will just highlight a few of the many facts that we include in a well organized resume anticipate the keywords an employer will attach to the position you seek by keeping a log of words taken from help wanted ads and other sources electronic resume software programs search for job titles departments degrees universities attended companies worked for and the organization you belong to try to use the keywords as often as possible without overburdening your resume with them there is a fairly standard form for detailing information about ourselves and employers expect us to submit it in a recognizable way the following sections discuss the possible content and manner of presentation for our resume heading resumes are usually headed with our name address and telephone number this information may either be centered at the top of the page or placed in the top left hand corner career goal our career goal which follows our personal identification is one entry that every employer is interested in we must be specific as we can listing our immediate goal and not some vague future dream job position being applied for we must specify the position we are applying for examples systems analyst account executive securities analyst etc this position must be related to our career goal education and training this major section should state the most important qualifications we can offer for the job we are applying for if it is work experience that section should come next if it is our educational background that is more important place it first in either case we must tailor our qualifications to fit the job requirements this does not mean however that we are to falsify the information we provide it simply means that we are to pick out those qualifications that have the most direct relationship to the job for which we are applying for example suppose we are applying for the position of market researcher the person who reads our resume will not be interested in finding out that we had taken courses in baking orchid raising or canteen operation they will not also be interested in learning that we have worked as a teller in a bank but this person will be interested in reading about our experience in research or if our educational background is in mathematics statistics etc and if we had taken a speed reading course the most common way to describe our education is to list any university college or vocational school we have attended with the dates of attendance and any diplomas or certificates we have obtained we always place our most recent educational experience at the top of the list and work back from there if we want to stress our education we may want to include our major field of study and the names of significant courses which we have completed we may also want to list any honors or awards we have received a prospective employer is looking for evidence of leadership potential social poise and interest in a broad enough range of activities to make us an interesting person therefore we could list our extra curricular activities in which we had taken part and list down the positions we held in campus or school organizations work experience there are two acceptable ways of presenting our work background the most common is to list our jobs in chronological order with the present or the most recent one heading the list with such an arrangement the prospective employer can readily detect our progress or promotions if we use this format we should show the following a position held b name and location of company c date the position was held d achievement in the position e reason for leaving in addition we can strengthen our presentation by including the following a duties emphasize responsibilities b name of immediate superior if the person is still there and might be a good reference c job title e g systems analyst field sales manager etc if on the other hand our experience is scattered or we have done a lot of volunteer activities or if our employment history is spotty a functional resume can turn unrelated activities into a coherent business background when we use this format our experience is listed under descriptive categories in this way a wide variety of activities paid or volunteer interspersed with inactive periods can be presented to our advantage personal details personal data include gender age date and place of birth race religion optional marital status including number of children health height weight interests and hobbies references applicants for a job are usually requested to give the names of at least three persons who can be asked or called to speak about us the most appropriate persons include present or former employers teachers and other professionals also acceptable is a character reference whose name or occupation is respected if we include references in our resume we must give each individual's name title organization if any address and telephone number if we choose to provide the prospective employer with references at the time of the interview we make the following notation on our resume references will be supplied upon request in either case we must ask permission from the person before including his her name as reference the completed resume finally our completed resume must be concise well organized and easy to read the length should be one page or two pages at most after all we are summarizing our most important qualifications for a particular job not telling the story of our life appearance too is a very important factor to the over all presentation of our resume we must be careful not to overcrowd or spread out the information on a page we should also have our resume carefully typed or printed single space on x good quality white bond paper one which is handwritten or full of poorly made corrections will probably not be read at all honesty is a very important factor in a resume phony degrees or schools will be discovered we should not also exaggerate our accomplishments our resume should show progress advancement and ambition a good resume must get us at least an interview for an in depth study on resume writing and to give you an idea how it looks please go to these links and type in the search words how to write

what is the best way to resign from a job i have worked the same dead end job for years after and a half years without a pay raise they finally gave me a cent raise a month ago which imo was a slap in the face after years of service and many broken promises and excuses i felt like they never really treated me that well even though we got along ok on a personal level i have already enroled in college and am going back to school in a few weeks i am really nervous about how to resign as i can see an altercation with the owner who is a bit of a hot head i want to quit the right way but i feel like i owe them nothing more than the bare minimum what is an acceptable way to put in my two weeks without starting a fight has anyone used a letter of resignation if so how do you deliver it in a way that is professional even the most difficult job situation should be left graciously and courteously this is not the time to tell your boss what you really think of him or to offend your ex co workers by assigning blame even weak bridges should not be burned a formal brief resignation letter should be given to your current boss do not discuss any negative reasons for your leaving simply say that the new offer provides you with new challenges and opportunities your letter and discussion should be positive in all respects tip if you are leaving in good terms take the time to continue your contacts with your former co workers and superiors they might be useful networking contacts for you in future job searches peace and blessings  Unemployment Economic inequality Cyprus dispute EastEnders Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Dog training Plame affair Education in the People's Republic of China Wal-Mart Alex Ferguson Procrastination Ocean's Twelve Social rule FairTax Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Bah__'__ divisions John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Newcastle United F.C.

good careers without college is it possible to have a good career without college my parents took my college money that i earned with my own job i wasn't going to attempt to earn it all back and i never saw the need of college i hate the fact we have to pay to learn when we can just learn from the job itself there are many jobs that say i need a college background although i could learn the material myself graphic designing web programming etc but i seem to be nothing without that stupid degree i had nothing but a's and b's throughout highschool and now i'm stupid server in a stupid restaurant and i want out and a better career without college any suggestions sorry to call serving stupid but in this town it is i am working at one of the top notch restaurants a fine dining with a full bar right on the river but they still treat us like we all came from mcdonalds there are virtually no good jobs without some education under your belt notice that i said some education most people do not realize that there are huge opportunities for people to go to schools that do not take a tremendous amount of time and last less than a traditional year degree look into a technical college in your area and do some research on careers that might interest you then look at the wages associated with those careers and the amount of time that it takes to learn the job or go to school truck driving is a good example of a career where people make good money and do not have to spend a lot of time in school some trucking companies will even pay for your school or teach you themselves other jobs that might interest you are in the healthcare field there are many technical jobs there that do not take a lot of time in school my advice to you is to take the o net interest profiler it's free and a good tool to learn your interests google it that same webpage has a ton of resources that are free to use that give you wage data on many jobs and the education you need to get there good luck to you oh and you can work and go to school at the same time millions of people do it and it keeps you earning the money while you are paying it out for school it will be worth it in the end go back to school degree is not necessary for a good job but it helps a two year degree is often better paying than a year degree  Economic inequality Software engineering Microeconomics Computer Education in the United States MMORPG Minimum wage Mach kernel Capitalism Education in Germany Education in Romania Master's degree Pitaten Inflation Student loan Education Homeschooling Avenue Q Tax Capital accumulation Affirmative action Lawyer BASIC programming language Statistics Anarchism and capitalism Cornell University Final Fantasy XI Education in Japan Education in Portugal University of Central Florida Year 2000 problem James J.

any tips for college graduates trying to find jobs out of state i am graduating from college this month and have been applying for jobs for the past month or so my current location doesn't offer many job opportunities so the vast majority of jobs i have applied for are out of state how do i convince employers in my cover letter to hire an out of state and entry level candidate i'm not expecting my relocation expenses to be paid yes of course being a college graduate finding a job has it's own set of challenges those i know how to handle if you don't have a real answer then please don't respond does your college have placement assistance and do they have sister colleges in other states that would be a good start i've had to coordinate several out of state interviews which typically start with a phone screening interview with hr then a longer phone interview with the hiring manager if we feel we're really interested at that point we'll try to get the candidate in the office for an in person interview ideally you could get a few potential jobs lined up around the same time and schedule a vacation to interview with each one but that rarely works out as far as your cover letter you should modify it to be specific to each position company location you're applying to explain why you're looking for a job in that specific area and for that specific company and let them know up front that you'd be willing to pay your own moving expenses that way they know you're not just a graduate looking to use a company to pay your expenses to move to a new area but that you're a serious candidate then give them an idea of how you could make yourself available for an interview would you be willing to fly out for a final interview can you only do interviews by phone and if you're going to be in their area any time soon make sure you let them know that too the more questions you can answer in your cover letter the more comfortable they may be with interviewing you in the first place of course the more flexible you can be logistically the better your chances good luck  Graduate school Plame affair Social rule Professor Mach kernel Unemployment GED Education in the United States Quizbowl Paralegal Education in Germany Game programmer Microeconomics Karl Rove Drug test Maryland General Assembly Election, 2006 Grade (education) Strategic management Life insurance Wal-Mart Avenue Q Walt Disney World College Program Academia Ra (board game) $ale of the Century Labor theory of value Expert system Air traffic controller Public Eye Winning Streak Species Wheel of Fortune FairTax Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Friends Management Credit card Incident Command System Volleyball American football Probation officer Master's degree Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Jeff Gannon Efficiency wages Dog agility Student loan MAME Public transport Windows 2000 Education in Romania Broadband Internet access Amiga Power Stan Lee The Ashlee Simpson Show Theory of conduct Sudoku Evan Mecham Minimum wage Baseball Fielding (cricket) Surveillance Scientology beliefs and practices London Congestion Charge Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Neopets Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Milton H.

job question no call after strong verbal interest i met with someone about some volunteer work i am doing they asked me about my background work education i told them they asked me for work samples and resume b c they had a project that they thought i could help on i sent everything during the meeting about the volunteer work and via an email they expressed strong interest in hiring me to do some contractrual work told me all about the project etc since that initial meeting and one email i rec'd nothing i have emailed to check in but nothing a total lock out weird what is weird is i will have to interface with her about the volunteer work i guess i shouldn't mention the paid work how awkward pls thoughts these are excellent points i will not take it personally and be confident thanks so far to answerers it might not be anything personal perhaps they lost the funding for this position and don't have a paid job to offer anymore or maybe they are awaiting a decision from somebody higher up the chain of command this is pretty common in business and the hiring process can take much longer than you'd think if you want you can mention that you're always interested in doing more work with company to signal that you're still interested you can ask about the job outright but it might be an awkward conversation  Plame affair Advance fee fraud Social rule The Apprentice 2 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Pretty Good Privacy G-Man (Half-Life) Karl Rove Episodes of Lost (Season 1) God Emperor of Dune Expert system Outsourcing One Tree Hill (TV series) Labor theory of value Call centre Fight Club Michael D.

what qualities are best in an employer not from a professional perspective but from the perpective of the employees have you ever worked for someone that you truly enjoyed working for what qualities did that employer have that made him her stand out my favorite employer was one who allowed me the flexibility to make decisions along with the understanding that i'd be responsible and able to fix mistakes because of those decisions it's good to be able to have the confidence that your ideas and choices won't be second guessed or belittled but actually given a chance to fly on their own merits and business being business if they don't fly how can things be fixed doing this allows for creativity which isn't always encouraged at a job an employer who allows employees to be individuals while still operating within the framework of the company allows flexibility and creativity to shine good work should be rewarded examples of desirable behaviors should be modeled and displayed not left in the great and unattainable unknown a shop owner i worked for in the past used these methods along with a positive outlook so important and a genuine concern for people i must admit he was very strong and outspoken in his faith but he presented it to me and others in a positive and non invasive way it was obvious to me that the lessons he learned from his faith about how a life should be lived were also present in his beliefs about how a business should be run and employees should be treated good man great boss  Workplace democracy Consensus decision-making Microeconomics Corporate governance Social psychology Objective-C Keynesian economics Free will Unemployment Alcoholics Anonymous Ethics Transactional analysis Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Extreme Programming Religion Dog training Aesthetic Realism Predestination Gross domestic product Polyamory Religious Society of Friends Theory of conduct Theodicy Economic inequality Atheism Sexual orientation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Motivation Password Insurance Education in Japan Leadership Inflation Copyleft Infantilism Homeschooling Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Capitalism Simone Weil Object-oriented programming Game theory Meaning of life Debugging Charles Grandison Finney A Course In Miracles The nature of God in Western theology Ethical consumerism Happiness Rick Santorum Management ELO rating system Information Services Procurement Library Divine grace Sola fide Supply and demand Labor theory of value Dilbert Principal-agent problem Philosophy of business Quantum mechanics Jewish principles of faith Dynamic Systems Development Method Surplus value Franz Boas Philosophy of language Francis Crick Requirements analysis Business ethics Prisoner's dilemma Trademark Summa Theologiae Network effect Art Past and present anarchist communities Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Public good Soul Science fiction film Software engineering Cultural relativism Merit Ontological argument Futures Studies Sweatshop Wood carving Sin Phaedo Supernatural Strategic planning Labour economics Ownership Milton H.

had a good second interview whats next has anyone ever had a second interview usually what happens afterward i talked with all the managers and even employees who have the position i am applying for it seems redundant to be asked for a third interview and from what i was told this was the last round from your experience usually how long does it take to hear if i got the job or not i recently had a great second interview with a local company and they told me to give them a couple weeks to respond with an answer the hr manager should have told you to expect to hear back from them within a certain number of days or a couple of weeks sometimes the company can make a decision within a matter of a couple of days or couple of weeks call and ask them to when they will make a decision good luck  Social rule Plame affair Eddie Guerrero Big Brother UK series 6 ITV The Ashlee Simpson Show Teen Girl Squad Michael D.

can my employer ask me if i have a best friend at work my mn employer passed out surveys to all staff asking us questions like 'does my supervisor or someone at work seem to care about me as a person ' 'are my coworkers committed to doing quality work ' and 'do i have a best friend at work ' also we are required to put our names on the surveys i don't see what these questions have to do with my work performance and i don't feel comfortable honestly answering these questions what if managment doesn't like someone's answers and sets them up to get fired or forces them to quit i think you should go to human resources and ask whether it's appropriate generally when these surveys are given to employees they are given anonymously so that employees feel they are able to answer honestly once you are asked to put your name on the survey there is no way you are going to be able to answer to questions honestly and the surveys are a wasted effort i understand your concerns about the surveys being used as a reason for firing employees but i don't think that is their intent notice they don't ask you to point fingers and name names e g name an employee you feel is not pulling his or her weight around the office this seems to be a fairly standard survey to assess the work environment and see where improvements can be made the main issue is the one about writing your name on the survey that's a huge no no in any research science i think your employer just made a mistake there but isn't trying to trap you  Theory of conduct Statistical survey ISO 9000 Unemployment Corporate governance Breastfeeding Polyamory Ethics A Course In Miracles Social rule GED The nature of God in Western theology Domestic violence Galactic Civilizations John Lott Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economics Scientology beliefs and practices Environmental Protection Agency Psychology Kyle Broflovski Strategic management Internet troll 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Call centre Census Equine conformation Organic farming Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Efficiency wages Coming of Age (TNG episode) Expert system Cult National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration George W.

how to not feel badly that male coworker was a jerk to me he's always been rude and pompous and i always figured he hated me i figured he thought i was ugly and would think my being friendly would be misconstrued as me hitting on him so i avoided him i killed him with kindness and we were cool i even though he might have liked me from the way he acted and checked me out i am not a huge flirter just like to be social i went over just to say hi and he was totally rude and obnoxious so i left and have been ignoring him he sometimes looks at me but i just ignore i caught him staring at me sitting outside so now he completely avoids even glancng at me even if we are the only ones in a room i am sooo annoyed and dont know how to deal next time i will have to work with him i want to say i wasnt hitting on you and your are arrogant i thought we were cool and you treated me like some dumb ugly slut you made me cry and you suck how can i handle asking him for help working with him next time how to put this into persepctive you know it kinda sounds like he may like you and just have really really bad social skills anyhow just don't worry about it he seems to keep acting like a jerk whether on purpose or just because he doesn't know better and this probably won't cahnge so i'd just avoid him as best i could and be civil to him don't ignore him but don't pay him and special attention either just treat him like you treat everyone else and ignore his bad behavior as best you can i guess here is the perspective you need if this guy likes you or doesn't who cares not really going to affect you to much either way so just don't worry about it at all move on to other things and just forget it this guys opinion is not so important right now and again i don't think he has a bad opinion just lousy social graces  Beavis and Butt-head Ranma __ characters Avenue Q Futurama (TV series - season 5) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Totally Spies!

husband being overworked what should he do it's a very long story but basically my husband is the only developer for a particular product on his team now the client keeps adding more and more code changes to be done for the following week's product he has two days to code and yet they keep giving him over hours of work to do in those two days the client is not concerned because and i agree with them it's not their fault that my husband's employer hasn't hired anyone to help him he's told his bosses repeatedly that he needs help explained that he only has two days to do the code changes and that they are assigning him hours of work to do in those two days but they keep not doing anything meanwhile his workload keeps steadily increasing each week short of quiting what can he do shelcom that's my point they are assigning him hours worth of code to do in hours i'm not making it up it's the truth it's really stupid this sounds very familiar to me my husband was in a similar situation again long story too and he was in an impossible situation because he couldn't do all the work himself but there simply wasn't the manpower to get the job done he was also in the unfortunate position of taking over the job which had been very badly managed before him so he was also trying to undo other peoples' mistakes whilst taking all the abuse from the client for things that were out of his control he stuck it out for months and eventually found another company it was a real shame because he'd had such high hopes for the job and the company but they repeatedly hung him out to dry i would say don't trust a company that doesn't support you like this if they are unwilling to provide the manpower to enable him to do his job they are penny pinching and bad organisers he would do better to cut his losses and look elsewhere i know he doesn't want to quit but ultimately you have to look at where this company is taking him he is overworked and stressed and his company is clearly taking him for a ride to them it's all about saving money your husband needs to consider his health and welfare above all there are better companies out there i am sure who are willing to manage their workforce more effectively than this perhaps eventually your husband can start his own business then he wont have to put up with rubbish like that  Extreme Programming Plame affair Wal-Mart Unemployment EastEnders Friends Working time MMORPG The Apprentice 2 Theory of conduct Kodocha Blonde on Blonde Corporate governance Outsourcing Ultima Online Game programmer Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Domain Name System Dilbert Knots Landing Ashton-Tate Divorce Gross domestic product Workplace democracy Windows 2000 Final Fantasy XI Management Avenue Q Traumatic incident reduction Labour economics Software engineering Infantilism Customer relationship management Call centre Blackjack Poker jargon Pitaten Transactional analysis Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Microsoft Enterprise content management James T.

i would love your input about my current job situation i have been working at a retail shop for a while now and have wanted to quit for some time the reason why i have stayed is for the money the people are very unfriendly and have at times treated me as well as other employees like we are years old i have received my schedule for next week and am only scheduled for under hours of work this is suprising and shocking to me since i have been scheduled over the past couple weeks for hours in addition i feel i am a great employee i have come in as early as am to help with new items being brought into the store i have never complained about early or late work hours or last minute changes i am really thinking about quitting it has lately seemed that they do not appreciate me or my work ethic the positives of quitting would be that it would give me a real kick in the pants to find something and spread my wings and find something i could really build as a career the negative aspect no immediate money coming in gurl first thing to remember when considering changing jobs is never quit a job unless you have another one to go to immediatly like quit on friday and start the new one on sunday or monday but of course you may already know that the thing is in your field of retail business retail personal have a high turn over basicly because it takes no degree to work they usually hire teens from high school because they can get them to work in the evenings and the company does not have to pay for insurance when your not considered full time you did not say did you recently get a new manager or assistant manager because when these come in they have a tendency to clean house so to speak' and that's getting rid of those they do not like or want in order to hire some of those they do the new hires may have come from a store they all worked at this could be one of the reasons for the cut hours did the store just hire a few new people this could be a reason too as they will need some of your hours to train the new ones it' is possible they are gearing up for the holidays yep i said the holidays if you have been in this business very long you know what i mean the retail business is a very demanding job to have as yes customers do treat you like you the scum of the earth and think your as stupid as dirt and you know the old saying that the customer is always right lol but we all know you have brains for one thing your putting up with idiots all day long now if you do decide to leave then you do leave with one thing expierence in retail therefore you can go to just about any other retail shop and work if that's what you want go to your manager and ask to talk privately with him her get to the point right off say john or whatever their name is i need to talk to you about my hours they will say something like ok what's on your mind then tell them i noticed that my next week schedule only has me down for hours and i was wondering since i have been working like why the cut be honest and up front with them ask why how when and what do i need to do to get back my hours back up if they give you an answer that you feel is stupid or just plain dishonest then you need to move on but be coy about how you move on tell them i really need the hours and i m sorry but i just have to find another job that can give me the hours because i need the money to pay for yadda yadda yadda you'll think of something this gets you a good reference when putting them down on a new application somewhere else haveing retail expierence can get you in doors you might not think you may want to become a manager highly paid but get treated like crap from the district managers and home office you may want to rethink that one lol my husband worked in retail as assisstant and manager for family dollar and dollar general and loved the money but the home office and district manager can make you life a living h i have heard everything from them cutting his hours for his employees right at their holidays when he needed more hours to get things done weekly truck loads of boxes came going from to then jumped to boxes and was expected to get all this out in weeks time plus moving the store around plus redoing shelves it was a very hard job to do unless you were in a bran new store where when you went to work the store wasn't already filthy and had peices of boxes still waiting to get oput on the shelves plus another coming in days i hope i have enlightened you on a few things but hang in there and do what you feel is best for you good luck  Wal-Mart Social

during an interview if i am asked what are your weakness how should i appropriately answer thanks to those who give sensible answers well i can tell you that you certainly do need to have something you feel you need to improve on i interview hundreds of people a year and you'd be surprised how many people say they don't have anything that they need to improve we immediately recognize that either the person doesn't have the intelligence we're looking for or that they're just lying everybody has weaknesses and the higher the job you apply for the more the interviewer is looking to see if you're smart enough to recognize your weaknesses and are working on correcting them i wouldn't come up with a list of things that might become a real turn off lol but there were some really good examples given above my advice is that you take a long look at yourself and jot down two or three things that you see as a weakness in your performance then pick out the number one and phrase it as others have said in a positive way most people dislike confrontation having to deliver criticism to others i work closely with my team i'm quick to compliment wins when i recognize someone is having a problem i teach them how to correct the situation but if the person just doesn't develop into a solid contributor i dislike haveing that formal discussion about poor job performance getting out of the comfort zone is another weakness many people possess i really get nervous when asked to speak in front of a group of people and i'm working on organizing my thoughts in an outline to refer to so that i can be more effective at public speaking being a workaholic is one interviewers love to hear i have trouble establishing a work life balance because i get so envolved in my job that it's hard for me to leave at the end of the day you can see why we like to hear that one but even if it's true for goodness sakes don't say things like i really hate dealing with people or it's hard for me to count all that money without being tempted to take some of it those answers would certainly insure your application would end up in file lol good question good luck  Social rule Theory of conduct Scientology beliefs and practices The nature of God in Western theology Time Out of Mind Extreme Programming Plame affair Goodness and value theory Ethics Kasparov versus The World Pitaten The Apprentice 2 Logic A Course In Miracles Shit Numerology 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Death Gate Cycle Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Ashlee Simpson Show Alignment (role-playing games) Atheism Piccolo Junior Saga Chess strategy and tactics Richard Feynman Alcoholics Anonymous Dog training Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sola fide Philosophy of language Past teachings of Prem Rawat Microeconomics President (game) Humphrey Bogart Equine conformation EastEnders Avenue Q Ten Commandments Ken Jennings American and British English differences Yusuf al-Qaradawi About a Boy Gender-neutral language Poker jargon Predestination English grammar Rudolf Hermann Lotze Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Epistemology Expert system Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Computer numbering formats Consensus decision-making Appeal Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Novel Autism U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 The Catcher in the Rye Friends Sharon Tate Mao (game) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Jennifer Lopez Health insurance Shaggy dog story Incarnations of Immortality Blood on the Tracks Irony Aphasia Non-native pronunciations of English Capitalism Kodocha Dead Like Me Leviathan (book) Rick Santorum Teach the Controversy Anarchism and society Nicomachean Ethics Downing Street memo Dyslexia Hiberno-English Religious Society of Friends 2000 Australian Grand Prix Transactional analysis Little Britain American Psycho Ex-gay Justification (theology) Saint Whose Line Is It Anyway?

trouble scheduling second job interview dont want to lose current job while i search for a new one i am applying for a different job one that i probably will be happier with and i need to figure out when to schedule a second interview i already went on a first interview and i met with two people and i had to request half a day off at my current job which i've only had for a month my problem is that i cannot afford to request more time and i dont want to lose this job for an interview without knowing if i will get the job the lady that wants to interview me is available at a time that im not what should i do see how flexible she is to meet at lunch time or immediately after work if she is hardnosed about it the second interview can be at x or y time on this date and that is all i have available then you have to weigh your options if you know that if you request the time off from your current job even if you offered to make up the time the next day they will say no then call in leave early that day i don't want to encourage you to lie but if you are working for a company that is so inflexible that they will not let you off an hour early when it is prearranged then perhaps you don't want to work there anyways and should do what you can to get out  Social rule Unemployment Life insurance Shaggy dog story Probation officer Education in the People's Republic of China Call centre Indian nationality law Computer Plame affair Ravi Shastri Wal-Mart George W.

if i already said i would accept a lower salary range can i negotiate up once i get an offer i am flying out on tuesday for a third interview in nashville after two phone interviews the second interview was with the cfo part owner and he asked about salary requirements i through out the high 's knowing that this position paid well and told him i didn't wish to throw a number on myself however after researching their job postings i have since seen the position posted on monster and hotjobs as paying k per year assuming the on site interview goes well and in the past i have done well on these occasions is there any room to negotiate a higher amount than i initially stated my wife said that if they make me an offer below k i should just ask surprised and tell them i saw the range as k and i am comfortable with the low end of that range knowing that i will be compensated as i take on new responsibilities what should i say if they bring this up again while i am on site which is a likely scenario i am not sure i agree with the first response it's not uncommon to negotiate a salary i am coming in from out of town so it is possible that my geographical region doesn't pay as well as theirs and i would be under paid for the responsibility i am taking on ok don't follow your wife's advice that is incredibly bad job interview acceptance etiquette part of why you are being considered is because you said the salary range you did it was your mistake not researching this information before that question came up or coming up with a more general response that doesn't set a cap on your worth as in i am looking to increase from where i am now and understandably be compensated for the fact i will have to relocate if i am considered for the position it is negotiable you take the position for what you are offered and negotiate after you are hired and are doing the job for months to a year after you prove you are worth more that or look for other opportunities and learn from your mistake  Plame affair Salary cap Microeconomics Professor Satchel Paige Betting (poker) Graduate school Economic inequality Supply and demand Credit card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Blackjack National Kidney Foundation Singapore Estoppel Contract Google The Apprentice 2 Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Karl Rove John Kerr Craps Rick Santorum 1994 baseball strike Mutual fund Steve Jobs Investment bank Time Out of Mind Internet fraud The Shining (film) National Football League 2004-05 NHL lockout The End of the World (Doctor Who) Professional wrestling slang Tenshinhan Dream Job (Season 2) Avenue Q Sharon Tate Wal-Mart Speed limit Education in the People's Republic of China Theory of conduct Alan Keyes Affirmative action Unemployment Wang Mang Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Shaggy dog story Extreme Programming Turbocharger Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans GED Friends Publicly funded medicine Member of the European Parliament Dog agility Killian documents Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Knots Landing Oxford English Dictionary Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Piccolo Junior Saga Labor theory of value Social rule Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Life insurance Central processing unit Surveillance Datalore (TNG episode) Insurance Incarnations of Immortality Public transport Warrant Officer Slow Train Coming Academia Infantilism Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Student loan Jessica Lynch Ra (board game) Fox hunting Education in Germany Babe Ruth Search engine optimization

when do employers typically call to verify past employment just something i've wondered about do potential employers generally call previous employers prior to a pre employment interview or after the interview if they are considering hiring you i know every company has their own way of doing things just looking for a general idea it depends on the size of the company and the nature of the job i took at job with a mutual fund company once and they called me in the office after i had been there for months because they had a question on some information put on my application i explained the miscommunication and all was well but i was surprised that they were looking into information from my job application months after i had started the job when i've hired people i checked their references after the interview when i knew i was interested in hiring if there was no interest i wasn't interested in spending time checking references just make sure you don't use a reference that would not say nice things about you  Plame affair Background check Expert system Milton H.

i'm a cashier at a restraunt is less than weeks notice acceptable i'm years old and this is my second job as a cashier in a restaurant making an hour i have worked at this place for about a month and i am ready to quit i asked for hours max when i applied and this week they scheduled me almost and when i confronted them they said there's nothing they can do about it because they fired one cashier and another quit so they have no one else i am starting college in less than weeks and i have alot to get done before then and with my hr schedule i just can't i would feel bad for just quitting or not showing up due to the fact that they would have only morning cashier left after i leave i do not need this company as a reference so i do not know if weeks is necessary i am scheduled to work tomorrow and sunday with the new schedule coming out on monday so would it be okay to write a letter stating i cannot work after monday or what should i do also if i just quit on the spot i would still have to go back to collect my last paycheck can that cause a problem weeks notice is just a guidline quiting this job or any job is your prerogative but this is an opportunity to show good judgment moral character and that you are a team player aside from job qualifications these are what employers look for in a potential employee as well as current and previous employee for rehiring i suggest that you talk to your manager face to face and be sincere write your letter but make a list of the things you have to get done to get ready for college and a schedule try to work something out but don't be afraid to lay out your terms if weeks notice is too much for you then compromise if compromise doesn't work then quit if they fire you then that's really not a good atmosphere while your in college anyway you have tried your best to help them but you've got to do what's best for you what you want to keep is a good reputation and a clean concience a former employer gave a letter of recommendation for me that landed me a scholarship i've quit and rehired by this employer several times all the while i've been professional and up front with my priorities if my schedule conflicted with them we parted ways with their blessings and every time with a letter of recommendation for another job if there was a job opening they would check up with me if i was available and i would work for them occasionally sometime i'll tell them i need more money and i'd get a little raise it's a long lasting relationship that got me through college  National Football League Avenue Q Unemployment Wal-Mart Monday Night Football Education in the People's Republic of China Plame affair Sydney Riot of 1879 Friends Eddie Guerrero Social rule Ocean's Twelve EastEnders Extreme Programming New York Giants Ty Cobb Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Walt Disney World College Program Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Major League Baseball television contracts DisneySpeak STS-59 Education in Germany Explosive material World Championship Wrestling Badly Drawn Kitties Goodness and value theory Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Amazing Race Poker jargon Graduate school Risk management Advance fee fraud Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Drug test Leon White The Apprentice 2 I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Fight Club Saturday Night Live Scientology beliefs and practices American and British English differences Blonde on Blonde Aldi Operation Market Garden Eric Bischoff Shawn Michaels Article One of the United States Constitution Babe Ruth Health insurance Seinfeld Ten Commandments Memorial Stadium, Clemson PGA Tour Larry King Boston Public Honey and Clover Current teachings of Prem Rawat The Contender (television series) Blackjack MTV2 Labor theory of value Springfield Nuclear Power Plant Spice Girls John Layfield Leeds United F.C.

nervous about my interview i have the experiance but my criminal background messes it up any advice it was back yrs ago and i fill like is honging me any advice or sucess storys just as a head note certain jobs will not accept a worker with a criminal background i e civil service working with children police public sector so that unfortunately might affect you greatly maybe i am not the best person to answer back seeing as i do not have a criminal back ground but if you have the experience then that should be one thing that sustains you it sounds obvious that your criminal history is in the back of your mind but if you know that you are resentful or regretful and freely reformed of what you did in the past and they were to ask the only thing you can do is be honest and demonstrate that what you did in the past has no reflection on the duties you are able to perform in the job you are applying for so to speak the interviewers obviously see enough in you to invite you for an interview in the first place you could have been rejected at the application review point much earlier so thats one positive thing to take with you into the interview room what you did in the past is in your past and obviosuly you cant change that every bad instance carries a consequence true but what you can do is continue down your line of positivity not every employer is going to necessarily like what they see on your record and you like any other normal person will face rejection just pick yourself up and keep on learning from each experience and the further you go and the more you learn the less it will worry you  Plame affair Ethics Hearing impairment Victor Cousin A Course In Miracles Social rule Government of France Workplace democracy Graduate school Goodness and value theory Appeal Scientology beliefs and practices Philosophy of language Theory of conduct Cultural relativism Education in the People's Republic of China Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Economic inequality Psychology Time Out of Mind Gay rights Yusuf al-Qaradawi Alcoholics Anonymous Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Franz Boas Hillary Rodham Clinton Coercion Dissociative identity disorder Efficiency wages Copyright law of the United Kingdom Infantilism Shaggy dog story Strategic management Ontological argument British national identity card Slow Train Coming Jiddu Krishnamurti French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Scots law Bayesian inference Inheritance (computer science) American and British English differences Australian constitutional law Highway 61 Revisited Behaviorism Contract Friends Charles Dickens Arthur Cayley Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead Politics of the People's Republic of China Stuttering Singapore gay equality movement Notary public Transactional analysis God Emperor of Dune Attorney General Entropy Scientific method Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Sexual orientation Autism Crime Labor theory of value Nuclear option (filibuster) Divine grace Biblical inerrancy Transsexuality Theodicy True Crime: Streets of LA Charles Grandison Finney Divorce Unemployment Law of the People's Republic of China Music Software engineering 1957 World Series Loudspeaker Simon Commission Singlish Common law Meme Extreme Programming Education in Hong Kong Copyright Aikido Shit Parliament of the United Kingdom Immanuel Kant Supernatural Media bias Antisocial personality disorder Immigration to the United States Peer review Lie

how do you get yourself promoted even though your boss thinks that you are really good at your job my boss and his boss both thinks that i am good at my job so what can i do to make them go the extra to give me a raise and a promotion if you are generally well thought of it never hurts to just ask for one you should lay out your strengths and how you have contributed to the company overall in the past few years and highlight your accomplishments to make it compelling during the conversation also mention to them that you would like a formal review and that it is one of your goals to be promoted within the next six months ask them what you will need to accomplish in order to make it hapen if they are aware that it's important to you it will be easier to remind them when your annual review happens  Social rule Theory of conduct Alcoholics Anonymous Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Scientology beliefs and practices Pittsburgh Steelers Jack Charlton Appeal Big Boss Value system The House of the Dead (video game) Affirmative action San Francisco 49ers Chess strategy and tactics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in the People's Republic of China Alex Ferguson Management Ghosts 'n Goblins Neurofeedback Yearbook EastEnders Kill Bill The Dukes of Hazzard Workplace democracy Transactional analysis American football 2000 Australian Grand Prix Donald Rumsfeld West Ham United F.C.

why do recruitment agencies say they've temp work for you but you never get any from them wow i'm amazed at two things here there must be some really awful recruiters out here for people's opinions of temp agencies to be so low not a lot of people really understand what a staffing company really does i own a staffing recruiting and consulting firm so let me try and clear up some of the misconceptions on this subject from the perspective of the agency agencies get paid by how many candidates they have in their database at times i wish this were true but this is completely false we get paid based on how many hours a hired candidate works for a temp position and a negotiated fee for permanent hires the reasons why you are not getting assignments could be anything but more often than not the reason you did not land the assignment is because it closed that fast in temporary staffing especially most proficient agencies can react to a candidate need within hours and by react i mean submit a candidate have them interview and be ready to start the project with jobs being filled that quickly the reason recruiters want to meet with you even if they may not have a position immediately available for you right this minute is because when they do they need to be able to move swiftly on your behalf and if they've met you already this is something they will not have to do later i could talk about this subject all day feel free to send me a follow up message if you'd like to discuss this further  Plame affair Employment agency Karl Rove Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Incident Command System The Apprentice 2 Call centre Internet fraud Education in the People's Republic of China Advance fee fraud British Civil Service Drill instructor Probation officer Graduate school Anarchism in Spain Extreme Programming Secretar__a de Inteligencia Theory of conduct Economic inequality Election Principal-agent problem Social rule Wal-Mart Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Time Out of Mind America's Army Continuation War Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) A Course In Miracles Microeconomics Martin Heidegger The Amazing Race Air traffic controller Determinism Coalition Provisional Authority W.

should i employ him or not a somewhat trivial question perhaps but i would like to have your opinion i have a former employee that left to try another work as he did this he parted with telling everyone how good it should be to leave since he was tired of the work and that he was generally not pleased with how things had developed for him the last six months after being at his new work for only four weeks he phoned me and was very regretful he had gained insight according to himself that his old job was much better than he had believed i met him to judge his sincerity and i think he really menas it so i need someone like him and have a place for him but what would you do everyone makes mistakes if he is sincere in what he says i think you should consider accepting him back in any case i think you should also give him a little lecture about what he said to your employees before he left peace and blessings  Social rule Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints John Kerr Sydney Riot of 1879 Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) George Edward Moore Past teachings of Prem Rawat Book of Mormon Plame affair Apology (Plato) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Secretar__a de Inteligencia Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones Cindy Sheehan 613 mitzvot Merit Karl Rove George Costanza American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Bertrand Russell Universal pragmatics Consensus decision-making Alexander I of Russia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Epistemology Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Religious pluralism Extreme Programming Joseph Louis Lagrange Customs and etiquette of Japan Yusuf al-Qaradawi The Human Stain Western betrayal The writing of Principia Mathematica New York Giants Katelyn Faber Killian documents EastEnders Patriarch Eutychius of Constantinople Ocean's Twelve Nicomachean Ethics Panay incident Graduate school Teresa Heinz Kerry Appeal Visitor pattern Creationism Species National Kidney Foundation Singapore George Oppen Current teachings of Prem Rawat Muslim ibn Aqeel Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Pledge of Allegiance Amiga Power David Blunkett Vladimir Peter Tytla Ludwig Wittgenstein A Course In Miracles Sola fide Cyrus S.

why is anyone even disciplined when things like 'couple steamy love emials' get accidently sent to everyone when you get cases like some guy sends his girlfriend a sexy email or she sends one to him etc and it accidently gets broadcast ie send to all etc why sack suspend or even give a rats ass so they are in a couple and in love and mentioned what they are doing later tonight surely a sign of a happy stable life outside work which should mean a less stressed employee better able to work so if things like this hit the news why does the boss just say to the press oh grow up and get a life at least they have more of a life then you have you not got anthing better to care about like the war in iraq the flood victems or how young single pople cant afford homes as for should be working emmn how lone did it take to read a paragraph emial minute half like that weill make a difference most likly perk them up like a dose of red bull as for embarrasing the company give over like most married couples dont have a sex life who cares as for professionalisim erm thats just can you do your job properly and give good service thats it the suit haircut if you kssi your girlfriend at work or have pink hair is irrelavant if i want say my car fixed all i care is a nice fix job on care and polite employees and polite just has to mean general manner or somone refering to you as dude or brov has more sincerity then somone forced to say have a nice day though their teeth actually got a work fitting in hour and a half for a job starting tommorrow morning what time do you have to be at work quote if they are sent via a works computer in work time you are defrauding the company er how what pence for an email quote ' because its not professional ' excuse me how does kissing your partner stop you being able to fix a computer well fly a plane be a good electrician especailly given most of your life is at work and the only place to get to knwo anoyone quote 'and most probably contravenes the terms of employment ' thats on bar with forced rape arranged marriages if you cant be with who you love surely you can attack the bosses marriage as he cant be in love either employment is not a right it is a privilege if you said people aren't happy with this they are allowed to move on actually employment is a right and if somethings rong it gets changed model flyer chick that whole attiude appears bogus as it is likely that the time and cost of said email would be so minute and pathetic it would not warent the admin time to may an issue out of surely there are more important things to worry about comanaies anla about a few seconds email time are likly to cost themselves far more in emplyee stress and having to hire new employees as for incompants and unprofessional if i was a clinet i would think that was sweet and funny i define professionalisaim on the basic of can they do the job i paid them for ie sort my accounts in fact i would make it an issue that if the boss so much as looked at the love puppies i would take my business else where as how an employer treats their enmployees and other social envronmentsal issues would be a factor in who i choose to do business with ie no sweat shops forced labour abuse of indigonous peoples i agree with you in the uk there seems to be a culture of immaturity and embarrassment when it comes to sex what's the big deal it's a normal biological function it seems to me the people who complain about this sort of thing are on a power trip trying to earn brownie points to further their career either that or they're not getting any  Friends Theory of conduct Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sin City Divorce Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Spam (electronic) Marriage Plame affair Unemployment Infantilism Internet fraud Knots Landing E-mail spam Dead Like Me Call centre Gender role Trade union Mail-order bride Supply and demand Polyamory Software engineering Insurance Economic inequality Rape Economics Labour economics Sexual orientation Neighbours America Online George Costanza Make money fast Social rule St. Elmo's Fire (film) Public transport Goodness and value theory Something Positive Anarchism and society Marilyn Monroe Zoophilia Intelligence quotient Same-sex marriage Rick Santorum Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Religion Citigroup Cliff Richard Wright brothers Skinny Dip Trademark Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Shaggy dog story Child sexuality Great Teacher Onizuka Pretty Good Privacy Customs and etiquette of Japan Unlawful combatant New York Giants Homosexuality and transgender Sweatshop National Kidney Foundation Singapore Kodocha Homestar Runner Phishing Workplace democracy Transactional analysis Property (ownership right) Same-sex marriage in Canada Futurama (TV series -

group interview at topshop i have a group interview tomorrow morning at topshop has anyone ever had one of these what happens what kind of questions might be asked i'm terrified there are two kinds of group interviews you are interviewed along with the other candidates for the position this is a cut throat play against each other type of interview the strategy for this type of interview is to answer very thoroughly when you are the first candidate to speak and is you are second of third you can agree with what the other candidates say but you must also add to your answer good luck these are tough you are interview by a panel of people asking questions i think this is actually easier than a regular one on one interview because the interviewers are more relaxed there is less pressure on them just be sure to look at each person and make eye contact as you answer every question remember everyone's name i got down initials and smile you should also send a thank you note to each person good luck in either case the questions will probably be similar see this website http www rileyguide com interview html  Social rule HTML World Wide Web Plame affair Expert system Game show Roswell UFO incident Cross site scripting Statistical survey Have I Got News For You The Apprentice 2 Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Interview Nicomachean Ethics HyperText Transfer Protocol Sampling (music) Deep Throat (Watergate) Trumpet Contract The Joker's Wild Family Feud Quotation mark Plame affair timeline Website Hollywood Squares Crossword Theory of conduct Wesley Clark Sharon Tate Time Out of Mind Proportional representation Consensus decision-making Cascading Style Sheets Web crawler Poker jargon Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Edward R.

for managers and company hirers please what should someone do let's say that someone has been a willing and conscientious worker for over years they've become the victim of a sustained two year campaign from specific members of staff but the normal grievance process has been sidelined by the senior management to protect those members of staff responsible for the victimisation as well as the good name of the company if the employee was to seek another job outside that company and they are not asked directly by the new company if they are on sick leave should the potential employee reveal this or just hope that the new employers don't find out until the potential employee has secured the new job and proven themselves is it harmful to a job application to admit to stress having been the victim of a sustained campaign of overwork unrealistic deadlines and plausible denial by the more senior staff who are grossly incompetent at their job and badly organised the victim can provide proof of incompetence your thoughts please thank you so far this is a uk employment based question so far no one has offered up any pointers as to who could confirm these statements i e hr manager company owner or website details i will continue to look forward to new answers as stated val the grievance route has been sidelined by the senior management there is no one higher and there is no union hence the reason for moving jobs the senior managers have been aware of this issue for months and they chose to ignore it all along the person concerned has dependants and commitments and is looking for another job at present but this issue of long term illness due to stress is the main factor that may hinder hiring this is not the first case of this kind at least two other members of staff have been treated this way within the last years and after leaving the 'constructive dismissal' claim did not work for them there is solid evidence that the most prominent victimiser has stolen from the company and the senior managers simply dismiss this as untrue they refuse to look at the evidence it would be harmful to admit to stress and a sustained campaign of overwork any interviewer won't know the people you would be talking about and might assume the worst i e that you can't handle the stress if you are on sick leave then the new employer does not need to know references tend to be very generic in the uk e g john smith worked for company x for years between and if you current company started mentioning sick leave or anything else in your reference and you didn't get a job as a result then you could take legal action therefore companies tend to stick to generic references one of the main things interviewers look for apart from ' can this person do the job' is can i work with this person if you start criticising your current colleagues that will scare interviewers off who might think you are not easy to get on with good luck  Plame affair Coercion Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Karl Rove Insurance Unemployment Life insurance Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) SCO-Linux controversies Contract Labor theory of value Theodicy Brian Lenihan Involuntary commitment Killian documents First Amendment to the United States Constitution The Apprentice 2 Estoppel Vivian Solon Abortion debate Abortion Trade union Expert system Appeal Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Probation officer Torture Workplace democracy National Kidney Foundation Singapore Capital punishment Ex-gay Plame affair timeline Intelligent design Slander and libel Arguments for and against drug prohibition Roswell UFO incident Wealth Holocaust denial Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda Atheism Health insurance Deprogramming Management Democracy Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Corporate governance Decompression sickness Capitalism Free trade Cultural Revolution Domestic violence Reparative therapy Alcoholics Anonymous Mediation Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Project Blue Book British national identity card Theory of conduct David Kelly Strategic management Rick Santorum George Galloway 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Social rule British National Party Michael D.

how in the do stupid people get jobs when the person who has the real skills and talent doesnt can somebody please explain this there are many reasons an interview doesn't result in a job offer the interviewer may think that the applicant lacked the skills to perform the job was unable to answer questions clearly and concisely didn't project and successful profile and lacked poise or confidence was overly aggressive personality wouldn't fit with team was unprepared and asked few if any meaningful questions lack of research about the company was unable to explain unfavorable factors in a resume such as employment gaps or lack of degree had unrealistic expectations about salary was more interested in salary benefits than the job almost all interviewing problems could be avoided by taking the time to prepare and practice before the interview remember it is not necessarily the candidate who is the most qualified who gets the job it's the applicant who convinces the employer that she he can do the job and become a dynamic part of the company team the formula to success is part skills and part personality so make a good impression peace and every blessing  Economic inequality Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social rule GED The Apprentice 2 Civil rights Plame affair Unemployment Graduate school Game programmer Workplace democracy Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Theory of conduct Extreme Programming Social psychology Blackjack Professor Capitalism Inheritance (computer science) Scientology beliefs and practices Steve Jobs Offshoring Outsourcing Fight Club Inflation Expert system Affirmative action A Course In Miracles Gross domestic product Salary cap Freeters Science Intelligence quotient Altruism Alexander Technique Strategic management Publicly funded medicine Contract Peter Singer Principal-agent problem Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Karl Rove Taxation in the United States Collaboration Microeconomics Consensus decision-making Psychology Parapsychology Gender-neutral language Current teachings of Prem Rawat Criticism of libertarianism RISC The Apprentice 2 candidates David Beckham National Kidney Foundation Singapore Killian documents Life insurance Complexity classes P and NP Intelligent design God Emperor of Dune Insurance Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Labor theory of value Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Milton H.

why do jobs pay employees off the books why do certain jobs pay there employees off the book or under the table are they getting some kinda benefit from doing this paying someone in cash is a way to avoid reporting them as an employee this brings benefits to the employer the employer does not have to carry the employee on their books does not have to contribute unemployment taxes does not have to pay any of the taxes associated with paying wages also any insurance l i or health regulations can be avoided a worker who is accepting cash also frees the employer from any liability if that worker is injured on the job there is no recourse for that employee because they were not employed it also frees the employer to ignore health and safety regulations they don't have to be concerned about that employee anything that happens to them is their problem it brings some benefit to the employee in that they do not have to report their earnings or pay taxes on them but it is not only illegal but risky  Insurance Social Security (United States) Minimum wage Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Health insurance Wal-Mart Unemployment benefit Tax Compensation of employees Workers' compensation Unemployment Microeconomics Employment in Hong Kong Capitalism Trade union Life insurance Tax credit New Deal Social Security debate (United States) Employment Reaganomics Pension 401(k) Annuity Capital accumulation Great Depression Payroll Social security Public policy Labour economics Dave Reichert William Beveridge Government debt Offshoring Health care in the United States Medicare (Canada) History of the United States (1918-1945) Cooperative Flat tax Retirement plan United States labor law Variable universal life insurance Canadian and American economies compared Economy of India Arguments for and against drug prohibition Social welfare Economy of Russia Anarchism and capitalism Inflation Employee Retirement Income Security Act Child support Exploitation Great Depression in the United Kingdom Outsourcing Economic inequality U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Lloyd's of London Airline Tax resistance Progressive tax Food and Drug Administration Israeli Arab Free trade Credit card Immigration to the United States Civil rights Principal-agent problem Food Stamp Program Keynesian economics Conscription Affirmative action Tax avoidance/evasion History of post-Soviet Russia Winter of Discontent Tariff Citigroup Drug test Publicly funded medicine Contract with America Dividend Warren Buffett Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Health savings account United Kingdom corporation tax Unemployment types Freeters Economy of Norway Surplus labour Negative income tax Sweatshop Canadian and American health care systems compared Labor-power Labor theory of value Privatization Tort reform Slot machine

please answer is becoming a nurse really worth it i completely want to become an rn but recently i took sort of an 'internship' in the hospital where i would want to work at and found that it seems to be a dull and hard working job i thought it was maybe just the floor i was working on or the hospital i was at but i also volunteer at a hospital in another city and it just seems to be the same there too please don't get me wrong the thought of helping people and devoting my time to them is practically what i love to do but i am just afraid i will take four years of my life to become a nurse and when i finally get to be one i will regret it if their are any rn's out there please let me know if becoming a nurse is really worth it does it get better thank you there is a movement toward community based health care so in the future there may more opportunities in public health areas so there will be no problem for you to get a job unlike others who can't get one at all nursing requires a lot of physical activity there is a great deal of standing bending and lifting it can be emotionally demanding especially if you are working with severely ill or dying patients of course it can also be a tremendously rewarding profession occupational hazards for nurses are similar to those of other health workers they include contact with patients who have infectious diseases such as hepatitis and tuberculosis and injury from instruments chemicals and gases some nurses work very irregular hours those who work in hospitals or nursing homes may work hour shifts including nights or weekends others such as those in community centers may have more regular schedules most full time nurses work between and hours a week and have between and vacation days a year i am not a nurse but two of my cousins are we have a family blog to keep us in touch and this is a quote from one of them what i dislike about nursing as a profession is first off time you never have enough time to do everything that you want you find yourself running short of time and only able to give the most essential aspects of your care and health teaching and not do everything that you feel you should so that s the main drawback with nursing another drawback with nursing respect sometimes the profession is not accorded the respect that it should be it doesn t happen very often but when it does you really feel it what i like about nursing as a profession is that first you can help people that is you can help them by relieving their pain giving them medication you can help them with their anxiety about their health condition by talking to them about it giving them comfort and you can also help their families another thing about nursing is that you can always be learning and you never have a dull moment you can work in different areas you can specialize like emergency or cancer or surgical and you can work at whatever pace you want in the area that you choose i work in emergency at the moment and lastly it s very portable nursing is a profession that you can use across borders i've given that alot of thought so you guys might be making overseas phone calls to me she told me she likes it overall because the pros outweighs the cons and she couldn't see herself doing anything better i really hope this helps you i guess it's good for you that i came across your question haha  Nurse Prostate cancer Palliative care Cancer Childbirth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Health insurance Breastfeeding Psychiatry Urinary incontinence Nursing Triage Emergency Medical Services Stroke Publicly funded medicine Traumatic brain injury Milton H.

i need advice from court reporters in southern california i am reallly considering becoming a court reporter i am in the riverside moreno valley area of southern california if you are a court reporter or are in school to become one please help me out with the following do you like what you do enough to recommend it where did you go to school for how long and how much did it cost what can i expect as the pay rate if i become one i work full time now so i would have to do the training on nights or weekends sorry for the long questions but i really would like input from people who actually are court reporters not just the info im finding on websites thanks alot for helping me and i know my grammar was off and so was my punctuation i was typing fast just trying to get a few helpfull answers thanks for the heads up i do realize this is not a job interview if it was i really dont think i would be writing this way i guess there is always someone ready to attack i can't completely answer your questions because i don't live in southern california but i graduated from court reporting school three years ago so i can give you some insight first of all it can be difficult you must practice daily in order to pass your tests the tests are pass or fail and are based on how fast you type once you pass one test you are thrown into another class that is more challenging most reporting schools make you pass q a question and answer jury charge when the attorneys talk to the jury and lit just talking sort of like jury charge some reporting schools make you to go class during the day i had a friend who came from bryan college in ca i'm not exactly sure where it is in ca sorry before she moved to tn she went to school between hours a day monday through friday so if that doesn't work for you you may have to consider an online school try bryancollege edu for tuition questions court reporting is supposed to be a two year program but many students take more than that as far as pay rate it depends on what kind of work you do are you working for a firm doing depos or are you working as an official reporter most court reporters are charged an appearance fee and make money on copies to attorneys some are paid salary but it just depends it's also not a job because you have to factor in the time it takes to edit transcripts almost forgot california has a state certification test that you have to pass before you can work i think they give you a year to pass it but if you don't pass it then you can't work have you been to ncra org's website or looked on yahoo's groups for a court reporter group i am sure you can find more info with the yahoo group don't forget to factor in the cost of a steno machine and laptop and software if you factor all those in that will cost you roughly you don't have to have anything to start school with but the steno machine but you will eventually need the laptop and software okay about me i went to chattanooga state in chattanooga tn it took me two years and a semester but i graduated and do closed captioning work i work at home and i also go to local universities and other events and caption things i started with people in my class and so far about of us have graduated two of us graduated with two years and the rest soon followed the rest of the people either dropped out or are still in school  Graduate school Juris Doctor Education in the People's Republic of China Lawyer Education in the United States GED Education in Germany Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Plame affair Student loan 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Attorney at Law Karl Rove SAT Extreme Programming Theory of conduct Education in Romania Software testing Education in Australia Sydney Riot of 1879 Password Driver's license Affirmative action Expert system Law school IBM PC compatible Turing machine Rosa Parks Social rule Friends 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Evan Mecham Education in Portugal Appeal College admissions Insurance Moreno Valley, California Taxation in the United States Timeline of the 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Software engineering SCO-Linux controversies Martial art CPU cache Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Complexity classes P and NP Mutual fund Battery electric vehicle James T.

any tax associates in a big firm or anywhere else how do you like your job just wondering what you think about being a tax associate for those who apply to this question just wanna hear some opinions on the negatives and the positives about your workplace your job why you chose a career in tax etc i'm in the same line and i wanted some opinions about this career option thanks i answered this in another spot but will list it here again i'm not at a big but am speaking as someone at a large regional firm pros you will never stop learning or reach a point in your job where you feel you have bottomed out if you have the ambition you will learn more each month than you would a year in school you will find yourself rise at a faster rate than your peers who go into sales in just a few years not only will you be making a nice living starting pay isn't bad either but you will find yourself talking to the heads of large corporations as their equal in shorter time than you would think cfos etc will go to you for advice job security if you are good at what you do you will never find yourself out of work for long unless that is your choice the demand for good help is too great and that will never change to the point that you can't find a position to meet your needs cons the hours especially during tax season this hurts especially if you have young children but if you are not too much of a family person and the family friends you have are flexible this shouldn't be a reason to avoid the occupation you will probably know within a month of busy season whether you can handle the workload the specialization if you concentrate on personal tax for instance there isn't much use for that outside of the field except for maybe as a financial advisor if you specialize in smaller corps million in rev and do more than tax work you can find yourself becoming more suited for a controller position if you love tax though this isn't an issue though as there is always work for someone who is competant i chose my career in tax because that was the position available starting out but i do not regret it compared to audit i'm in the office more and have a more steady commute etc but by working with the size clients that i do i am able to get out of the office a lot and not be stuck in profx all day really depends upon what specific duties you will be able to do if you are stuck doing only trust returns i personally would grow to hate that but if you are dealing with all levels of the engagement and all types of clients then the job can be a lot more exciting at least for myself my best advice big firm experience is great but if you want more variety in your work you can consider switching to a smaller national or a large regional firm easily and pick what you want to do once you have a years worth of experience  Microeconomics United Kingdom corporation tax FairTax Inflation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economic inequality Social rule Mutual fund Tax Warren Buffett CPU cache Life insurance Flat tax Taxation in the United States Expert system Law firm Corporate governance Avenue Q Supply and demand Insurance Microsoft Extreme Programming Graduate school Education in Portugal Shaggy dog story Canadian Senate Computer Poker jargon Progressive tax W.

i've been going to school for the last two years and now am looking for partime work for the summer which got me thinking as well i have major gaps and a very spotty track record when it comes to employment what can i do about these gaps plus some of the position don't follow one career path for example i have worked in youth programs for instance with the school district and worked on tug boats as a deckhand when applying for work how do i explain these gaps in employment and what do i do with the experience that doesn't go hand and hand with the job i'm applying for for the last year i haven't worked when i did work i was a commodities broker for months then left later i got a email from my employer stating i was fired before that i worked for the school district for the better part of a year before that i worked as a deckhand for a tug boat company month before that a sign company for month befor that i work for service comm out let for month crazy stuff my life i know now that those how become sucessfull in life stick to thing i don't think that's necessarily true having a broad spectrum of employment shows that you are well rounded and that you have much to offer to answer your question on your spotty track record what i would do is this omit those jobs from your resume or application that you were fired from or didn't leave on a good note with to make up for the gaps come up with an excuse perhaps that you were in school full time second if you are looking for a descent paying part time job i would suggest food service especially waiting tables restaurants tend to be less fussy about the details of your resume good luck  Outsourcing Plame affair Graduate school Division of labour Economic inequality Poker jargon George W.

cia or fbi i'm kinda stressing over this i cant decide what to choose as a career and i have narrowed it down to things work for the cia or the fbi i want to work for fbi because i wanted to be a special agent and see some action rather than sitting in front of a computer all day trying to crack a foreign encryption i want to work for the cia because it seems more important i feel when someone says fbi agent its just a fancy way of saying cop and i also would like top security clearance depending on what job i took please help i would like advice from anyone but preferably from people with experience oh and dont come on here just to say i wont help you because your government has killed so many people well i wouldn't suggest joining the cia it is not like in the hollywood movies it's way over exagerrated most intelligence gathered is done from the media and not busting into some place or breaking some foreign encryption like you stated if you work for the cia you would probably end up gathering some kind of information from the media or you would probably end up recruiting people from other nations as agents i'd suggest trying to get the fbi job and good luck with that  Plame affair Central Intelligence Agency Federal Bureau of Investigation Agent handling Classified information Sydney Bristow Espionage Plame affair timeline Project MKULTRA COINTELPRO John F.

jobs for year olds i live in pa and i called places and they hire or year olds i really want a job before summer's over here's a short list of summer jobs which you can create to generate income learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties birthday celebrations etc seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples a starter calligraphy kit usually runs around and anyone can easily pick up this skill the going rate is usually per hand addressed item become a poser who assists wedding photographers in setting and arranging various individuals in group and single photographic positions posers carry around a sketch book of various sitting and standing poses which consists of onion skin overlays of various wedding pictures bound in albums again contact local wedding photographers and wedding planners accordingly the hourly pay is around per hour and you are often invited to attend all dining activities seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting weed removal plant tree trimming light brush clearance you will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools again do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved a door to door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between to per hour offer policing removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process again a door to door solicitation of neighbors is in order you can charge between to per hour acquire a set of window cleaning tools a bucket liquid window cleaner sponge squeegee handle with an extension and a small step ladder and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services however be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story charge per window panel become a proxy stand in for neighbors to allow delivery of goods and packages to your home apartment acquire the authority to sign any receipt of incoming packages as an accepting neighbor charge per each package handled by you consider becoming a restaurant cafe customer liaison by using your cell phone at restaurants cafes to coordinate with the hostess to keep track of waiting customers whenever there's a very long period of time to activate a waiting list you want to offer the restaurant your services so that customers do not have to stand around for any lengthy period of time and when their name assigned number comes up you can call the upcoming customer's cell phone to tell them that they can return to the restaurant and be served the call back fee is usually around cents on a per head basis for example a couple would be charged while children under would not be charged placement of a plaque which outlines your fee schedule near the hostess station is sufficient to garner attention of prospective customers who will value your services since they can do other activities outside of the restaurant often beyond the range of any inhouse paging system you realize that everyone has a cellphone and why not take advantage of the connectivity to make the diner's experience worthwhile the restaurant will also appreciate the added service you are providing as a customer liaison why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing convalescent assisted living care centers and hospitals it involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves the starting rate is per hour the only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding a posting of your services by a business card or flyer on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers the paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time good luck  Spam (electronic) United States Postal Service Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Japanese tea ceremony Air traffic control Cable television Voice over IP

moving to washington d c without a job lined up i'm going to be startng college in d c in january but want to move there soon i know it's very expensive but i want to move there soon so i can begin the job search in person and not from halfway across the country i have decent savings and what not so i'd be able to live fine for a while before i start school and get a job any thoughts on moving there without a job or would it be advisable to have a job lined up beforehand thanks i'm not sure what you mean by decent savings so let me give you some information single bedroom apartments in the area go for anything between month depending upon where they are you can generally find a roommate using craigslist roommate com or some other similar service rooms for rent in people's basements or whatever can generally go from and up so you can usually get by for a bit that way if you don't mind sharing with your landlord groceries are probably fairly typically priced but i bought a gallon of milk yesterday for and i pay about for gas in the burbs and around in the more expensive areas in the city if decent savings means k i'd say find a job first if it means k i'd say you're safe finding work here most likely after you move the job market in the area is pretty good especially if you work in the tech industry and have or can get a security clearance metro doesn't travel far outside dc but it can get you to some of the suburban areas of maryland and virginia so you can get a reasonable distance out of the city for some slightly cheaper rents still in the ranges i indicated above if you're willing to travel longer to get to work school metro closes at midnight weekdays and weekends so that might be a factor for you and i believe it opens at or am good luck  Public housing Public transport Washington Metro Supply and demand Gross domestic product Warren Buffett Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Arbitrage Rapid transit Insurance Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Leasehold estate Broadband Internet access Dairy Wal-Mart Capitalism Graduate school Airline Taxicab Renting Friends Unemployment Avenue Q Publicly funded medicine Tax ZIP Code Monopoly (game) Gentrification Mortgage Supermarket Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Taxation in the United States Prostitution in Germany Narrow gauge Light rail Hydrogen economy Health insurance Price discrimination Stuyvesant Town Milk Plame affair Apartment Offshoring NorthBridge Apartment Complex Capital accumulation Hash table Mutual fund Chatham Square Tesco Real estate economics Inflation MTR Outsourcing Filling station Annuity Indian Railways White flight Theory of conduct Drug test Oplan Bojinka Scientology beliefs and practices Password Open cluster Bond Singlish Apartment building Alcohol fuel Wonderful Town Floppy disk Amtrak Free trade Wan Chai Implications of peak oil Carburetor FairTax Bulk vending Sam Walton Autonomous building The Commons Celtic Tiger Team Fortress Classic Karl Rove Portland, Oregon Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Daylight saving time Ford Motor Company Labour economics Mister Fantastic Labor theory of value Beltway sniper attacks Traffic light Air traffic control

changing careers not enough experience hi guys i have well over years working experience in investment firms and have worked in other roles mainly in a financial management capacity now i recently applied for a business manager position in an insurance firm the owner needs someone to help build the business to a new level and needs someone with computer marketing budgeting hr skills which i have i have a science degree with additonal specialization in accounting and investments one thing i don't have is an insurance backgound now the owner knows this and we have had a telephone interview he had me take an online aptitude test and is now calling me in for a personal interview what do you think the best focus will be for the interview to be ready with insurance jargon or to focus on how my previous skills can be applied effectively to a new venture in my opinion you should focus on how your knowledge skills and abilities are interchangeable and can be applied to other industries if you were to use insurance terminology without actually having experience in the field it may appear rehearsed and unnatural in which can be misconstrued as lying or not being truthful during the interview process this is only my opinion as i do not have as much experience in the workforce as you but it makes perfect sense to me  Economic inequality Insurance Management information system Institutional fund management Outsourcing Venture capital Requirements analysis Model (economics) Life insurance Second language acquisition Financial services Ross School of Business Science Management Strategic management Mergers and acquisitions Microeconomics Capitalism Epistemology Risk management Graduate school Economy of Singapore Privatization Finance Lloyd's of London Warren Buffett Citigroup Workplace democracy Supply and demand Construction Economy of the Republic of Ireland Annuity Mathematics Unemployment benefit Education in the United States IBM Medical school United Kingdom corporation tax Personal finance Accountancy Mediation Internationalization and localization Economics NASDAQ Psychology Hacker Economy of Russia Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Economy of Belgium Contract W.

what is the average yearly income for a screenwriter compared to other jobs also what is a good high school course for an aspiring screenwriter unless you are lucky enough to sell all of your scripts all of the time and get several thousand or even million for each of them you won't be making a lot of money you will need a second job at least until you sell your first script after that if you earned enough money you might be able to quit your job and write full time but that's not very likely at first if you manage to get a job as a writer with a sitcom or something then you'll at least have a steady income depending on how successful the show is you could make a very good living unfortunately screenwriting is an industry that is so varied that it is hard to give an accurate estimate of what the average yearly income is  Screenplay Screenwriter Labour economics Screenwriting Freeters Tax Income statement WGA screenwriting credit system Carl Barks Hollywood blacklist Game programmer Capital accumulation 401(k) PE ratio Gross domestic product Carl Foreman Unemployment Taxation in the United States Israeli Arab Productive and unproductive labour Arguments for and against drug prohibition Microeconomics Poker jargon Kevin Williamson Married... with Children Graduate school Social Security (United States) Education in the United States William Rose (screenwriter) Good Times Charlie Kaufman Surplus value Therion (band) Economy of Cuba Amway James T.

should i contact interviewer again he's not answering e mail about scheduled meeting i went to an a job interview for a job and the man insinuated that i pretty much had the job since i have some recommendations from other people who work there his managers he didn't make an offer though he said we should meet with his boss to increase the chances of a higher salary for me than we he had budgeted during the next week i contacted him two times via e mail he answered after the second e mail apologized for not answering earlier he told me to tell him which day of this week worked for me to meet with his boss i answered but he has not replied it's almost the end of the week should i contact him via phone to increase chances of meeting tomorrow or should i just wait it out i don't want to look desperate i'm not but also don't want to show lack of initiative thats kind of a rough call see for him taking over weeks with little communication is unprofessional if he is interested in bringing you on with his company on the other hand interviewing can be a lengthy process if there are internal canidates to go through if you have an insde edge with managers as you stated he may want to make sure he has appeased all interested parties before hiring you thats just a cya move when i interview canidates for any position i can appriciate a call back to check up but more than that takes up my time and comes across as desperate i would wait try to get some feedback from those you know in the company then call next week dont email and ask when does it look good in his bosses schedule to see you so that you can be prepared as much as possible for the interview tell him you are excited about the opportunity to work with their company and want to put your best foot forward and you would like as much notice as he can possibly give regardless you have the info to make the best choice go with your judgement off of how the interviews went and the interviewers personality if you dont think he'll be annoyed call him  Social rule The Apprentice 2 Advance fee fraud Killian documents Poker jargon Domain Name System Plame affair The Ashlee Simpson Show Shaggy dog story Kasparov versus The World Babe Ruth Knots Landing Volleyball Microeconomics George Costanza Corporate governance Escape from New York Surveillance Milton H.

how do you deal with a boss who is uptight about sick time my boss feels that you should only take a sick day if you're close to dying if you have a cold or something else you should either come to work anyway or you should have taken more vitamins to enhance your immune system so very rarely i do take sick days if i have a bad cold or the flu and i get snide comments from her when i return the firm i work for provides a guideline of no more than sick days a year this is only a guideline and by no means a concrete allotment so how do i deal with this boss how do i respond to her remarks i call in sick maybe three times in a good year maybe four times in a bad year and it's never for more than two days at a time she gets sick but she still comes in she prides herself on never taking sick time when i come back she will ask if i went to the doctor she will say oh so you decided to join us things like that unless you are abusing the policy just ignore her comments she prides herself on perfect attendance which indicates she has perfection and control issues nothing you can say or do will make any difference  Vitamin C Common cold Weapons of mass destruction Tocopherol Rick Santorum Corporate governance Trainspotting (novel) Folic acid Anarchism and society Antiviral drug Radiation poisoning Boss (video games) Ranma __ characters Immune system Cenodoxus H5N1 Donald Rumsfeld Spanish flu Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Time Out of Mind Social rule Poker jargon Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost Capitalism Akuma (Street Fighter) Ethics Beavis and Butt-head Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dubuque Gender-neutral language Evil StarCraft Episode VI Health insurance Utilitarianism Theory of conduct Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Phoebe Halliwell Goodness and value theory International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement Swedish allotment system Anorexia nervosa Calvin and Hobbes Psoriasis Charles Darwin's views on religion Maison Ikkoku Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Scientology beliefs and practices Angel (vampire) Double Dragon Blog Nutrition Nicomachean Ethics Insurance Narcissism Force (Star Wars) Journalism ethics and standards Vernon Schillinger Sola fide Drug abuse Charles Goodyear Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Blood (computer game) Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Hip hop rivalries Babe Ruth Duesberg hypothesis Japan-United States relations Mahathir bin Mohamad Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus CPU cache Characters in the Smurfs Economics E-mail spam John R.

another interview story today i went to an interview as part of formalities i shook hands with the interviewer who also happens to be the admin director and showed him my academic certs well he placed it aside and he told me nicely that he doesn't believe in papers qualification and it is the last thing he will see when deciding a candidate very normal isn't it yeah i think so too now the problem lies in the nature of business of this company you see this company is actually a commercial school dealing with education and courses if the director of the school does not believe having a good paper qualification can get you anywhere then why are they in the education business indeed it's a question i may pop during the nd interview but i guess that will more or less blew the whole session haha it is difficult to answer because your details of the school are sketchy before anyone can be hired they need to prove their qualifications and unless they are explained verbally in the interview the papers need to be reviewed again not knowing more about the job or school the incident maybe some kind of test kind of a stupid idea but this world is made of all sorts if your questioning the incident then the results must have been positive because you are looking for an answer to go back to them a second time  Theory of conduct Extreme Programming GED The nature of God in Western theology The Apprentice 2 High school Roswell UFO incident Academia The Ashlee Simpson Show National Certificate of Educational Achievement Graduate school Aesthetic Realism Social rule Education in Portugal Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Deconstruction G__del's incompleteness theorem Coming of Age (TNG episode) Scientology beliefs and practices Avenue Q Plame affair Philosophical skepticism SAT Education in Germany Shaggy dog story Karl Popper Scientific method Database normalization Russian joke Second language acquisition Donald Rumsfeld Milton H.

how can i increase my self confidence in job interviews i am insecure of my self because my body is think and slim compared to other average guys when i attend an interview i feel that my slim body makes me think that the other person when he sees me he get the idea that i will probably not fully fill my position as a grownup guy and i always felt that other people see me as a teenager because of my body am years old i am not muscular at all not even a little fat that make me so insecure when i stand to other avrage guys i am meters high feet and weight kilos pounds am not short but thin my question is how can i make my self feel better about my self psychologically i am working on my body now lifting some weights but in the mean wile i need to improve my self confidence from the inside thanks wear a nice suit that is tailored to fit your frame your clothing says a lot and if you feel good about your outfit you will feel better about yourself walk into the interview knowing that you got the job you're just there to simply make discussion with them relax during the interview don't sit rigidly just act very confident smile when you walk into the interview and shake everyone's hands remember their names and remember to say their name at the end of the interview bring in a notepad and don't be shy about taking notes if they start talking about details of the job that will look like you are truly interested and you are ready to learn the job etc remember be confident they don't care about your body they care about your brain and your communication skills good luck  Social rule Milton H.

how do i build good connections to very imnportant people in the community and state i realize that three fourths of success is one hundred percent connections if that even reasons as such i was wanting to ask anyone out there who might be knowledgeable in regards to building up connections amongst people in short i am a young college student who has a burning desire to be more successful than everyone else it is a nature in me that will not accept to be anything less than absolutely the best at what i do no matter what that is i also know though that i have not a clue how to get to know the people at the top in order to build a network of people that i can use in the future so how does a young relatively unnoticed and unimportant college student meet people whom he has absolutely no chance of meeting under normal everyday circumstances what can i do to get my name out there so that people will remember me when i go knocking on the door of opportunity upon graduation thanks for your help communicate you have to start by getting involved in your community functions etc right now many states and cities are in the process of voting get involved in someone's campaign volunteer for activities or something that you might be able to do phone calling is a great way to be recognized if you are in college check with the student message boards there are always activities going on whatever your major is law economics education etc you should have a mentor or advisor who can help you if you have not committed to a fraternity or other organization you might do that go to the parties and meet people one of the most important things you should know is that 'you have to have something that others are interested in what is your commodity what are you selling example when i first moved to this town from la i found the best way to expose myself musically and get involved with projects was to let people know i could sing once i was invited to dinner at a very nice place and there just happened to be a baby grand piano near the rear nobody was playing it and people were having dinner i sat and began to play some nice jazzy music and sang a couple of oldies blue moon i'll get by and before i knew it people were putting money in the huge brandy sniffer on the piano and asking for requests before the night was over i was singing respect and had made before i walked out and had a contract for the next month to sing at the dinner hour it's all about getting out there and stepping into a situation and being ready you do have to 'come ' with something in order to 'get' something so don't say you are unimportant you have not been noticed yet just like i wasn't use the gifts that god gave you they are there waiting to be exposed go for it and good luck  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social rule Plame affair Jon Secada Microeconomics Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Education in the United States Past teachings of Prem Rawat Poker jargon Current teachings of Prem Rawat Contract Delta Tau Delta Infantilism Friends Theory of conduct Barrister Time Out of Mind The Star Wars Holiday Special AFI 100 Years series Humphrey Bogart Education in the People's Republic of China North-American Interfraternity Conference She Loves You Hillary Rodham Clinton Milton H.

help i need help 'reading between the lines' during interview questions i just came from an interview this morning and i totally blew it i left the interview feeling slightly smarter than a cucumber the problem is that i know for a fact i'm way more qualified than what the potential hire need be my biggest problem during interviews is that i give the most lame answers that are totally vague is there a book or something out there that can help me recognize that when a person asks 'abc what they really want to know is xyz i have a book called questions you will be asked on an interview or something like it but i have only been asked about questions found in that book is there a book website that breaks down questions by profession i e questions asked specifically to managers computer programers accountants etc i think i could do a better job of interviewing if i had some type of idea what the interviewer is trying to find out when s he asks a question any help is greatly appreciated there is no standard answers it will depend on interviewer don't answer the question as yes and no explain your answer don't just stop it they want to hear if you have experience with it and how you handle it want to see where you want to be or become in their company start trying to introduce yourself and what you want them to know about you based on your profession then your presentation will be different however you must dress well clean neat good seating position don't look too nervous but no causal so you look like someone who has confidence in yourself but not arrogant speak clearly and if you don t understand a question ask again it shows you are willing to learn instead of pretending most people are looking for someone who is eager to learn and who is easy to work with don't think yourself is over qualify because why are you applying for the job if you are applying the job it means you need to get it then show them you are willing to work from the basic  Social rule Plame affair Expert system Theory of conduct Extreme Programming The nature of God in Western theology Whose Line Is It Anyway?

advice on turning down a job i need constructive advice on how to turn down a job position i was offered a teaching job and i am unsure if it is a good fit for me i have talked to the principal about the job and she seems eager and accommodating to meet my needs however i still just have an uneasy feeling about the position my previous teaching job was stressful and aggravating i'm afraid that i might accept the job and don't like it and then i have to stay due to contract reasons please give me some serious advice on how and what i should say when i decline the offer serious advice only be gracious and offer no reasons excuses in some cases in life being vague is a good thing if you offer reasons that opens up the possibility that who ever has offered you the job will look at your reason as an obstacle and one they need to overcome that is where you'll get stuck as you don't want the obstacles overcome consider something like this i appreciate the offer interviewing allows us both to learn upon considering all that i have learned about this position i find this opportunity isn't the right fit for me thank you for your time and consideration it's quite the compliment that you are being pursued you must have a lot to offer an organization but one thing you say stands out i have an uneasy feeling about the position i'm a firm believer to trust your gut your subconscious mind has registered something that your conscious mind hasn't seen yet go with your instinct best of luck to you  Social rule Milton H.

need advice i work at the cinema should i switch jobs or will it drive me mad i work at a cinema i sell popcorn etc or prepare coffee and when there are lectures there i help set up the place and so on it s a boring job and during the hours when there is literally nothing to do when people are inside watching the films after every inch is clean i m still not allowed to read draw or do anything i m expected to stand still and smile they give you looks even when you re talking to other staff members who don t have anything to do either but still it s an easy job which is not physically demanding and you barely do anything there and i get to see movies for free in the cinemas belonging to that company there s this other job working as a steward receiving people into the theatre checking their tickets making sure they re seated in the correct place it requires checking whether there are any technical problems and getting them fixed and cleaning afterwards it s pretty much the same difficulty level as selling food but what i see as an advantage is that you have to stay during the film and this way you get to watch movies while you work as opposed to doing so in your spare time which i don t have much of it sounds perfect for me as i love cinema but my boss said that it ll drive me mad to watch each film times or so if you have experience in this kind of job i d love to hear your point of view on the job i don't have any experience but i do think that you'll never want to watch the same movie more than times you'll hate it just my opinion if you ask this question in a different place you might get more answer  Movie theater DVD Social rule Theory of conduct RuneScape quests G-Man (Half-Life) Poker jargon Education in the People's Republic of China Motion picture rating system Singlish Floppy disk Mach kernel Whose Line Is It Anyway?

how do i become an extra in a tarantino film or harry potter film keep in mind that i am under years old my daughter did work as a model did commercial work and film work as an extra featured extra etc you need to contact various agents by sending in pictures your measurements height etc resume if you have one etc if an agent is interested they will contact you to come in for basically an interview if an agency wants to sign you to their agency make sure they do not ask for any money as my daughters agent had said if an agency asks you for money up front run and run fast they are not a reputable agency agencies make money base on the work you do the only money you should be forking the bill for are for the photographer that will take you pictures for your composite printing of your composites and either a cell phone and or pager these composites are what you give potential employers when your agent sends you on a go see and or an audition and it is best to print your info on the back of these composites from your computer don't do too many as your information always changes this will consist of your name measurements work you have done such as print work for mervyn's back to school flyer any and all film work any classes you've taken to better yourself in acting modeling etc special interestes such as green belt in tai kwon do years of classical ballet years in jr high high school band playing flute etc my daughters agent always required that we had a pager in the agents area code if that is what your agent requires i would suggest you also have a cell phone so you don't have to bother trying to find a pay phone when they page you a prior answerer told you that the agent will tell you what film you will be in wrong the agent will send you on go see's which is for print work magazines etc if this is what you want to do and they will send you on auditions which is for any and all types of film work this does not guarantee that you have been hire this is only an audition and sometimes you have to come back several times others it's just the one time and you may not get hired there are no guarantees film work can be an industrial training film for a bank my daughter did this and no one but the bank employees board of directors etc will see the work the general public will not see this in a movie theater music video commercial major film independent film etc anything that is on a film not still camera if you are hired by the employer not the agent you will be categorized depending on what work you will be doing extra featured extra principal etc a principal is generally someone who actually has speaking parts is more of a major person in the film an extra is just that a person who is an extra in a piece of film work featured extra is someone who has a little more to do on the film etc there are various categories you are also compensated based on what you are hired for categorized if you are an extra you get one flat fee and that is it let's say you could get paid for an all day shoot which could be or hours you do not get an residual payments at all if you are a principal you will get residual payments for instance you do a commercial it is nationwide you will get a residual check periodically based on how many times it is show the regions that it is shown etc and if the employer decides to take the original commercial and change it a bit you get another check because the basically made another commercial and you get another residual check if they stop running the commercial you stop getting checks on film work the agent will take basically a percentage of each check if memory serves me correctly my daughters agent took again this is for each time you get a check this is how they make their money print work is a one time check and going by memory again my daughters agent took i believe now on film work since you are under the age of you need an entertainment work permit which allows you to work it is similar but different from your standard work permit that you would get to work at a department store book store etc this entertainment work permit has to be signed by your parents as well as your school you are only allowed to work a certain number of hours like any other work permit some employers get around the long hours by not having you on the set for instance my daughter was filming a commercial at a house but they had us stay at a hotel and watch tv order room service etc until they needed her once she was on the set that is when the clock started ticking being a minor if you are working on a set during the school year there needs to be a studio teacher on the set and yes you still have to do school work and the studio teacher signs and dates the back of your work permit stating that you have down what is required by law also since you are a minor any and all film work that you do requires the employer to take a portion of your pay i believe it is and put it in a blocked trust account that you cannot access until you are years of age not even your parents agent manager can touch this this is a law i can't remember if it is just for california could be for other states as well but i know for sure in california called coogan's law for the former child actor jackie coogan who basically had no money after his childhood acting career thanks to his parents he also play uncle fester in the original adamm's family show i feel like i'm forgetting to tell you something but i'm rushed to go to work and i saw your question and felt compelled to answer you if you have any questions please feel free to ask me via yahoo answers i'd be more than happy to answer any questions that i can if i can also check out the link below it was my daughters agent she no longer does this sort of work she is concentrating more on her school studies go to frequently asked questions and then submissions and this will give you an idea as to what her agent required people to submit if they are interested in having her become their agent remember you don't hire the agent they basically are hiring you so there are no guarantees that the agent is going to sign you to their agency and going to go see's and auditions does not guarantee you a job think of it as an interview best of luck to you and again feel free to ask me any questions through yahoo answers  Constitution of the Turkish

i'm hardworking honest and new and i think being set up to look bad or worse what should i do i'm having trouble getting a job in my field so i took a position for the summer i'm overqualified for my coworkers are of different demographic education level their behaviour is sometimes unreasonable and they behave as if i'm not trustworthy by the way i must share a drawer with some of these people i am not informed of it being in or out of balance i feel as if my education reputation and everything are being risked to make a few dollars which are handy and making ends meet but i could do with out dipping into savings retirement am i paranoid no supervisor has spoken to me of a problem i only mention different demographic not because i'm focusing on differences but because highschool early college is different from late thirties i don't do the drinking after work i don't stand in the gossip circle that forms occasionally it's not bad just different interests if you are a new hire your supervisor should have a x meeting with you to see how things are going you can ask for feedback and guidance at any time then or before hand if you suspect a set up if you share a drawer and must balance you are entitled to know the results how else does one account or improve i do hear you about the qualifications and icky feelings re other employees been there and it's not fun my solution take a job with a temp agency that will send you to many different assignments in your area you'll get the same money without benefits but there's less pressure from the existing staff because you're just a temp and not a threat to them in fact many look at temps as life savers because they come in during vacations and times of extra work to take the load off the regular staff good luck in your search for meaningful and comfortable work  Principal-agent problem Social rule Scientology beliefs and practices Affirmative action Extreme Programming Academia Unemployment Plame affair Transactional analysis Outsourcing Education in the People's Republic of China Theory of conduct Graduate school Inflation Capitalism Corporate governance Maison Ikkoku Leadership Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social Security (United States) Education in Portugal Electrophysiology Strategic management W.

how can i get a job i am an intelligent man with a degree in finance i speak languages fluently have years of experience in trading commodities domestically and in international markets and i can't get a freaking job i dress speak and behave in a very professional manner and i have gone through everything from editing my resume to sharpening my interviewing skills etc any ideas what recruiters or hiring managers are looking for these days i have been literally unemployed for almost years in which i've lived off of my life savings i am a very optimistic person with a lot of confidence and a good attitude on life but i seem to have gotten somehow into this rut in my life any suggestions as to how i can get out of it i am starting to get very desperate and frustrated to say the least i'd very much appreciate any suggestions cheers please do not be offended there is obviously nothing wrong with your qualifications i think you are rubbing people the wrong way because of your 'brilliance' suggestion look for someone who knows you very well and ask him to check you out request him to help you 'diagnose' your situation ask him what is wrong with me why can't i find a job there are many reasons an interview doesn't result in a job offer the interviewer may think that the applicant lacked the skills to perform the job was unable to answer questions clearly and concisely didn't project and successful profile and lacked poise or confidence was overly aggressive personality wouldn't fit with team was unprepared and asked few if any meaningful questions lack of research about the company was unable to explain unfavorable factors in a resume such as employment gaps or lack of degree had unrealistic expectations about salary was more interested in salary benefits than the job you may also be targeting the wrong industry or going after the wrong job almost all interviewing problems could be avoided by taking the time to prepare and practice before the interview remember it is not necessarily the candidate who is the most qualified who gets the job it's the applicant who convinces the employer that she he can do the job and become a dynamic part of the company team the formula to success is part skills and part personality so make a good impression peace and every blessing  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social rule The Apprentice 2 Economic inequality Inflation Capitalism Plame affair Social psychology Gross domestic product Graduate school Asperger syndrome Unemployment Game programmer Software engineering Theory of conduct Education in the People's Republic of China Freeters Alexander Technique GED Milton H.

when writing a cover letter is it a good idea to tell the company you are seeking work for that you are looking for a job so you can save up for college in another state if not is it good to tell them during the interview never say that in your cover letter or interview the format for a cover letter is standard your letter should conform to acceptable business practice the first paragraph of the letter should establish why you are writing what position you are applying for and how you found out about the position the second paragraph provides you the opportunity to match your unique skills and abilities with those required for the position you need to direct the employer to your resume and then state those assets that do not appear on your resume but that qualify you for the position the third paragraph is your closing paragraph it states your appreciation for the employer s time and consideration and when you will contact him or her to set up an appointment an acceptable closing is yours truly or very truly yours or sincerely here is an example of a good cover letter blackstone drive malvern new york february mr jack sample managing director all city clubs inc west street suite new york ny dear mr sample enclosed is my resume in application for the counselor training program that was advertised in the new york times on saturday february i am a recent high school graduate with strong communication skills and a firm commitment to working with young people as an eagle scout and honor student i have always been active in community organizations my time as a volunteer in the ymca tutoring program was well spent and the personal rewards gained from working with young people influenced and shaped my career goals i feel confident that i would make an excellent candidate for your counselor training program i want to thank you for your time and consideration i will call on wednesday february to discuss a convenient time to meet i look forward to speaking with you yours truly david bartlett enc i hope the foregoing helps you if you need more help go to the links below and type how to write a resume http www google com http www yahoo com http www monster com geo siteselection asp peace and every blessing  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Boy Scouts of America Graduate school GED Jeff Gannon Volleyball School counselor Management World Wide Web A Course In Miracles Baseball Uniform Resource Locator Priesthood (Mormonism) College admissions Paralegal Affirmative action Economic inequality Succession crisis (Mormonism) OpenDocument Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Scientology beliefs and practices ISO 9000 Southern Poverty Law Center United States Naval Academy Gmail Quizbowl Education in the United States Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Scouting Consensus decision-making Jayson Blair Strategic management MoveOn SAT HTTP cookie Information Services Procurement Library Pretty Good Privacy George W.

job ideas i'm and i need a job anyone have any ideas here's a short list of jobs which you can create to generate income learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties birthday celebrations etc seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples a starter calligraphy kit usually runs around and anyone can easily pick up this skill the going rate is usually per hand addressed item become a poser who assists wedding photographers in setting and arranging various individuals in group and single photographic positions posers carry around a sketch book of various sitting and standing poses which consists of onion skin overlays of various wedding pictures bound in albums again contact local wedding photographers and wedding planners accordingly the hourly pay is around per hour and you are often invited to attend all dining activities seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting weed removal plant tree trimming light brush clearance you will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools again do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved a door to door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between to per hour offer policing removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process again a door to door solicitation of neighbors is in order you can charge between to per hour acquire a set of window cleaning tools a bucket liquid window cleaner sponge squeegee handle with an extension and a small step ladder and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services however be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story charge per window panel become a proxy stand in for neighbors to allow delivery of goods and packages to your home apartment acquire the authority to sign any receipt of incoming packages as an accepting neighbor charge per each package handled by you consider becoming a restaurant cafe customer liaison by using your cell phone at restaurants cafes to coordinate with the hostess to keep track of waiting customers whenever there's a very long period of time to activate a waiting list you want to offer the restaurant your services so that customers do not have to stand around for any lengthy period of time and when their name assigned number comes up you can call the upcoming customer's cell phone to tell them that they can return to the restaurant and be served the call back fee is usually around cents on a per head basis for example a couple would be charged while children under would not be charged placement of a plaque which outlines your fee schedule near the hostess station is sufficient to garner attention of prospective customers who will value your services since they can do other activities outside of the restaurant often beyond the range of any inhouse paging system you realize that everyone has a cellphone and why not take advantage of the connectivity to make the diner's experience worthwhile the restaurant will also appreciate the added service you are providing as a customer liaison why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing convalescent assisted living care centers and hospitals it involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves the starting rate is per hour the only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding a posting of your services by a business card or flyer on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers the paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time good luck  Spam (electronic) United States

when is an acceptable time to take holidays from work i have just recently moved up to a full time position at work and have holidays not including weekends or stat holidays to use before december i don't want to take my time off too soon but my company prefers it if i use all of my vacation time before the end of the year since there is no rollover to the next year between now and the december when are some acceptable times to use my holidays i presume that as in most organizations you submit a vacation request and then the company reviews it to make sure it is acceptable so if that is the policy put in for whatever days you want if it is unacceptable they will ask you to change it even if that isn't the official policy it can't hurt to put in your request in advance to make sure your office can cover your absense what i like to do with vacation days i need to get rid of when i don't have a specific place to go is to take a v day every friday for a month or so this way i get some nice long weekends and i am still regularly available at the office to make sure work gets done have fun on your vacation days  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus National Football League Tourism Daylight saving time The Sims Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Have I Got News For You ICalendar George W.

professional resume i need a resume for a position at a bank i've never actually needed a resume before sad but true my word program is not working what would be the best format for a resume in this field any good free programs for making them thanks a resume is a concise summary of all the information about us education work experience achievements and other personal details that will interest an employer although our prospective employer will read our cover letter before our resume the letter will just highlight a few of the many facts that we include in a well organized resume anticipate the keywords an employer will attach to the position you seek by keeping a log of words taken from help wanted ads and other sources electronic resume software programs search for job titles departments degrees universities attended companies worked for and the organization you belong to try to use the keywords as often as possible without overburdening your resume with them there is a fairly standard form for detailing information about ourselves and employers expect us to submit it in a recognizable way the following sections discuss the possible content and manner of presentation for our resume heading resumes are usually headed with our name address and telephone number this information may either be centered at the top of the page or placed in the top left hand corner career goal our career goal which follows our personal identification is one entry that every employer is interested in we must be specific as we can listing our immediate goal and not some vague future dream job position being applied for we must specify the position we are applying for examples systems analyst account executive securities analyst etc this position must be related to our career goal education and training this major section should state the most important qualifications we can offer for the job we are applying for if it is work experience that section should come next if it is our educational background that is more important place it first in either case we must tailor our qualifications to fit the job requirements this does not mean however that we are to falsify the information we provide it simply means that we are to pick out those qualifications that have the most direct relationship to the job for which we are applying for example suppose we are applying for the position of market researcher the person who reads our resume will not be interested in finding out that we had taken courses in baking orchid raising or canteen operation they will not also be interested in learning that we have worked as a teller in a bank but this person will be interested in reading about our experience in research or if our educational background is in mathematics statistics etc and if we had taken a speed reading course the most common way to describe our education is to list any university college or vocational school we have attended with the dates of attendance and any diplomas or certificates we have obtained we always place our most recent educational experience at the top of the list and work back from there if we want to stress our education we may want to include our major field of study and the names of significant courses which we have completed we may also want to list any honors or awards we have received a prospective employer is looking for evidence of leadership potential social poise and interest in a broad enough range of activities to make us an interesting person therefore we could list our extra curricular activities in which we had taken part and list down the positions we held in campus or school organizations work experience there are two acceptable ways of presenting our work background the most common is to list our jobs in chronological order with the present or the most recent one heading the list with such an arrangement the prospective employer can readily detect our progress or promotions if we use this format we should show the following a position held b name and location of company c date the position was held d achievement in the position e reason for leaving in addition we can strengthen our presentation by including the following a duties emphasize responsibilities b name of immediate superior if the person is still there and might be a good reference c job title e g systems analyst field sales manager etc if on the other hand our experience is scattered or we have done a lot of volunteer activities or if our employment history is spotty a functional resume can turn unrelated activities into a coherent business background when we use this format our experience is listed under descriptive categories in this way a wide variety of activities paid or volunteer interspersed with inactive periods can be presented to our advantage personal details personal data include gender age date and place of birth race religion optional marital status including number of children health height weight interests and hobbies references applicants for a job are usually requested to give the names of at least three persons who can be asked or called to speak about us the most appropriate persons include present or former employers teachers and other professionals also acceptable is a character reference whose name or occupation is respected if we include references in our resume we must give each individual's name title organization if any address and telephone number if we choose to provide the prospective employer with references at the time of the interview we make the following notation on our resume references will be supplied upon request in either case we must ask permission from the person before including his her name as reference the completed resume finally our completed resume must be concise well organized and easy to read the length should be one page or two pages at most after all we are summarizing our most important qualifications for a particular job not telling the story of our life appearance too is a very important factor to the over all presentation of our resume we must be careful not to overcrowd or spread out the information on a page we should also have our resume carefully typed or printed single space on x good quality white bond paper one which is handwritten or full of poorly made corrections will probably not be read at all honesty is a very important factor in a resume phony degrees or schools will be discovered we should not also exaggerate our accomplishments our resume should show progress advancement and ambition a good resume must get us at least an interview for an in depth study on resume writing and to give you an idea how it looks please go to these links and type in the search words how to write a resume ms word also has a resume template which you can follow http www google com http www yahoo com http www monster com geo siteselection asp peace and blessings source dr josefina o santamaria

is it terrible for a resume to be more than page in length unless you have a lot of experience and if you're asking this question i assume you don't have yrs of experience you should keep it to page i was an associate manager at one firm and the senior systems engineer at another and i saw a lot of resumes if i saw anyone with less than years of experience come in with a page resume i automatically chuck it in the trash it usually means a lot of fluff and waste of my time people that read your resume probably read s if not s to find a gem you want to highlight your specialties or your unique qualities don't make them dig through pages to find that gem even if you don't have a lot of experience behind you tailor your resume to the firm that you are applying for emphasize what you do know and the ability to work hard and learn  Plame affair RuneScape quests The Apprentice 2 Software engineering Extreme Programming Quizbowl Graduate school A Course In Miracles Strategic management Current teachings of Prem Rawat Alexander Technique Requirements analysis W.

h r block i am thinking of taking the h r block course and maybe get a job i am majoring in accounting and will have my as in a couple of months can someone tell me if its worth taking the course and the job if anybody out there who works for h r block can tell me the positive and the negatives of the job i appreciate all your answers i've just completed my first season with h r block i enjoyed it and it's a good fit for me first of all during the peak part of the season last third of january to about the middle of february i worked every day pm in the evening and hours on the weekend it was a bit hard on my family after peek ended the hours were cut back to a low of about hours per week they picked up again near the end of the season to about per week since i alerayd have a full time job i worked nights and weekends exclusivly just so you're aware i and everyone else had to sign a non compete clause which stated that when i separate service i could not prepare a tax return for an h r block client for two years within a mile radius of the city limits of the town i worked in thus if i didn't like working for them i can't just go work at a different tax company as mentioned before the job is commission based they gave a small draw approx to an hour against your commission however your actually compensation starts at of the paid return volume and of the optional peace of mind insurance program during last tax season i completed approximately returns and made gross keep in mind i'm in oklahoma which has the lowest cost of living of any area so i would expect the compensation to be higher elsewere besides the completed returns i i also had a number of returns i could not complete because they either walked due to the cost of preparation and or they had already done it with a tax software program and just wanted a second opinion or i refused to complete due to obvious fraud least you think i'm negative though it was a really nice fit for myself i didn't have to worry about issues that might occur if i tried doing tax returns on my own such as liability issues i also didn't have to do marketing and didn't have to invest my own money on expenses when i ran into issues i had not dealt with before ie indian exclusion there were a number of seasoned preparers to consult and advise on how to handle the issue i always tried to give my clients their money worth and because of the little things i did such as advice for the future i was able to get about to sign up for an appointment with me next tax season a year in advance these are clients i won't have to share with the other preparers in my office next year in order to get hired on they'll require you to take a basic income tax class class i've got off coupons i'd be willing to send you also can contact the local office and they should offer you a discount on the class i didn't know this and paid the full price the class has completly changed tis year previously it was on paper and pencil and required about hours outside of class for each instructional hour to complete all the exercies and reviews now however they are advertising little work outside of class time and you'll be learning to prepare the returns on the same computer system you'll use on the job around here the classes start in september we also had interns which were basically college students majoring in accounting who were doing the returns for not only cash but college credit as well they were treated exactly the same as st year preparers including being required to sign the non compete agreement and the same compensation hopefully this helps answer your questions feel free to contact me if you have any follow up questions  Insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Taxation in the United States Life

can you help me find a career i'm stuck i know what i like to do and not but cannot find a job that will fulfill that here's what i like to do help people i e counseling advice etc write love to write short poems informative literature etc research and be mobile not sitting all day long this i don't like to do math i'm not great at math i don't like children much i don't have good grammar skills however will work at it more than likely and i don't want to handle too much responsibility by saying that i mean such as a lpn which i have considered or a psychatrist accidental death or suidice is something i don't think i could handle if it was on my hands pay isn't really a matter right now i just want something that's compassionate and can make a difference in someone's life just some ideas would be great thank you so much god bless as of yet i'm a junior in college with no major declaration yet i've strongly considered social work english psychology as possible majors also i don't like handling money i didn't mention that wow look what you did you did a lot you did more in one question than most folks do in an afternoon evening weekend or longer this is what you typed here's what i like to do help people i e counseling advice etc write love to write short poems informative literature etc research and be mobile not sitting all day long i just want something that's compassionate and can make a difference in someone's life i've strongly considered social work english psychology as possible majors this i don't like to do math i'm not great at math i don't like children much i don't have good grammar skills however will work at it more than likely and i don't want to handle too much responsibility or a psychatrist accidental death or suidice is something i don't think i could handle if it was on my hands i don't like handling money it seems to me you would be a great teacher but a teacher of what and at what level i see you don t like children but in your eyes and mind when is a child not a child pre school kindergarten elementary school middle school high school pay isn't really a matter right now you could do some writing on the weekends or over holiday breaks couldn t you perhaps submit some articles or stories for publication for a few more dollars in the bank you have to eat and pay bills am i getting ahead of you the following is possibly the rest of your puzzle to solve please excuse me my answer is not meant to be cynical offensive or insulting however my answer is truthful and honest it doesn t make any difference what kind of career or business you have or want to have every business is a people business every career is a people career and every person has to pay her or his dues here s the same answer i provide for everyone the exact same qs each of my mentors asked me i m asking you in return you must be honest with yourself who knows you better than you no one except y o u you who knows your habits better than you no one except y o u you who knows what your needs wants dreams and desires are better than you no one except y o u you who knows what you like and dislike better than you no one except y o u you before you make that investment in time for a career or using your money to make an investment for a return on your money or a profit investigate btw when the following is done and done right it works there are two old sayings a the only stupid question is the question you don't ask b so you thought and think education is expensive just wait until you try ignorance ask questions of knowledgeable people remember this when you are in a group and you or someone else asks a question that question being asked could be a question one or more folks have on their mind but are afraid to ask don't be afraid to ask questions and keep asking questions until you get understandable answers to your questions this requires persistence and tenacity will some folks think you're a pain in the neck and another place absolutely don't settle for fluff answers or smoke and mirrors answers after getting all your questions answered to your satisfaction how do you make your decision benjamin franklin developed a very simple yet very effective system you can use more than sheet of paper for one career or one type of investment you can take as long as you like you can take as little time as you like you can simply ignore this this is your career and your life you re getting answers to and about sit down in a very quiet place no tv radio or any other interruptions or distractions at the top on a blank sheet of paper write the situation challenge problem you are faced with should i we do after the question draw a vertical line down the middle and a horizontal line across the top of that vertical line much like a very large upper case t on the left side of that middle vertical line write for or on the right side of that middle vertical line write against or under that number and write down all those things or points which could help you to go for that question under that number and write down all those things or points which could help you not to go or against that question do the same for any and all other careers your interested in pursuing you can switch back from sheet to sheet and from to and then from to look at the numbers between all of your sheets when the outnumber outweigh the do it when the outnumber outweigh the don't do it thank you for asking your question i enjoyed taking the time to answer your question you did a great job not only for your information but for every other person interested in reading my answer i m having a wonderful time being here on y a i wish you well vty ron berue yes this is my last name  Microeconomics Social rule Psychology Milton

what to do if your supervisor is against you my supervisor is against me because i am in relationship with somebody who used to be his subordinate and they did not get along neither kind of dirty rumors circulate in the workplace either about me or about my partner do not know if i need to look for an other job that's one of the reasons it's not a good idea to date someone where you work everyone gets in your business and personal business should not mix with business it would have been better to be very discrete at work when a supervisor gets it in for you there isn't much you can do except move to a job so that you change supervisors and they will bad mouth you to the new one or just start looking sooner or later they can get the goods on you to make you look very bad and tarnish your work record middle management usually is comprised of people who have risen to the height of their incompetance and that is why i worked hard to start my own business it's just so much better to come in to an office do my thing not rely on that particular client for all my and leave it takes time to get other office personnel to cooperate with you but managers are usually so glad to get their bookkeeping under control they don't give you much of a hassle i had one job so long ago and management did a job on me and i was so inexperienced and didn't have any idea how to protect myself or what to do i ended up quitting it was a dead end job so they did me a favor but when you are capable and get picked on there isn't much you can do discretely start looking for another job it is easier to get one when you have one and office politics is a good reason to move on usually you end up making more because you have more experience i don't think there isn't anyone that gives interviews that hasn't had to deal with office politics and it is a valid reason for moving on just be sure that your present job is not contacted until you are sure you want the next one do not give them permission to call unless they offer you the job and you accept but do explain the situation and do give the old job a couple of weeks to replace you and be sure to get all benefits coming to you like vacation etc good luck and i hope you find a place that is pleasant to work  Mach kernel Social rule Workplace democracy Unemployment Pitaten Nicomachean Ethics Theory of conduct Principal-agent problem Transactional analysis Contract Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Poker jargon Cheating in Counter-Strike Friends Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Plame affair timeline Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Volleyball Vivian Solon Time Out of Mind Leeds United F.C.

i never expunged my childhood legal record will a government job find it years ago years old i got in legal trouble all my jobs since have done background checks and i still got the job this time i didn't admit to any offenses i thought it was sealed and it is too late to expunge my record by the time i start this job i am going through the steps but will they find the record and should i make a copy of the expunction forms to bring in should i e mail them to tell them or wait till they say the background check found something if you really want the job you need to be completely honest usually an employer won't do more than check your background any more than the last five years or so nevertheless it is better to be straight up now than to have it come up suddenly some time down the road then you are fired without prior notice and you'll find yourself not only looking for another job but with a bad mark on your employment record and getting caught lying looks really bad a government employer on most occasions will check your background thouroughly and if they look they're going to find it you aren't alone by any means don't stress too much about it though most employers understand that people make mistakes in their lives and if you've kept your record clean for years they can easily see that you've made an effort to do well and have left all that stuff behind if you've already lied on the application just hope for the best but yes you need to have the expungement records with you just in case and keep those documents handy many things get lost misplaced or just fall through the cracks when it comes to government records but you don't want this coming up and taking a bite out of your butt later good luck nad  Poker jargon Social rule New York Giants Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Time Out of Mind 2000 Australian Grand Prix One Tree Hill (TV series) Computer virus Volleyball The Apprentice 2 Unemployment The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Shit Shaggy dog story Sydney Riot of 1879 Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Transactional analysis Cincinnati Bengals The Shining (film) Charles Goodyear The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Termination of employment Phoebe Halliwell Jon Secada Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Plame affair Theory of conduct Equine conformation Hey Jude Piccolo Junior Saga New England Patriots 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines The Amber Spyglass Toronto Raptors Infantilism Legal research Domain Name System Aerial (dance move) Year of the Spider Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Debugging Beavis and Butt-head Super Bowl XXVII EastEnders Kasparov versus The World I Want to Hold Your Hand Gospel of Thomas Paul Is Dead San Francisco 49ers Kim Possible Pitaten Draw poker Captain Thunderbolt Rich Mullins Prime Minister of Canada Software engineering Operation Market Garden St. Louis Cardinals Nicomachean Ethics Cheating in Counter-Strike United Kingdom corporation tax Journey (band) Reservoir Dogs Nation of Islam Alcoholics Anonymous Pok__mon Live!

should i call back my potential employer i had an interview on last saturday night i felt that the interview went well at the end of the interview they told me that they were going to do a background check and then call me back on monday or tuesday well they didn't call me back at all i am sure my background check was just fine because my credit score is fine i haven't done any crimes or anything like that etc anyway should i call them and ask them whats going on and if i were to call what would i say pathfinder i got the impression that since the interviewer said i'll call you on monday or tuesday and didn't just say i'll give you a call that he was interested in hiring me i don't think he would have said a specific day if he was just giving a generic response i would say that it's ok to call the interviewer back at this point when you get him her on the phone just say something along the lines of i was just checking back with you to see if you had any additional questions for me and let you know that i'm excited about the opportunity keep it short sweet i think it's likely that the interviewer had something come up and the time frame got skewed  Ocean's Twelve Plame affair Sharon Tate Our Friends in the North Jayson Blair Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March The Ashlee Simpson Show New York Giants The Shining (film) Amiga Power Background check 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans STS-59 Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February James Hanratty Time Out of Mind Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Kurt Cobain Paul Is Dead Saturday Night Live Major League Baseball television contracts Tennessee State Constitution W.

what to do if there is problem's in the work place ok well theres a woman at work that has been giving me problems like if i ask her something its always a short and rude answer and doesn't speak to me any other time well i told the manager and she was like well if things dont get better then we can talk about it well it had already been going on for a few weeks and then i finally said something she was always nice to me till i got promoted to assistant manager so im guessing thats the reason cause i cant think of anything else that she could not like me for i'm going tomorrow to look for another job cause i can't take it anymore i think the thing you are missing is you are letting this happen if you are the am that means you are the boss of this other lady she will keep up the attitude unless you do something to stop it some people have a hard time when someone they know is promoted above them maybe they thought they should have gotten the job but you can't let them take this out on you not in this job or in any future job what i would do is bring her aside very private and say what's the problem i think you are acting rude to me listen to what she has to say if she brings up a problem she's mad at you or having problems away from work deal with itt but either way end it like this you don't do this to a customer and you don't do this to another employee and you certainly don't do this to a supervisor you need to act like this job is important to you because right now you act like you want to get fired do you want to get fired because if this keeps up one of us will have to go who will be let go you or the am i don't want any special treatment i don't care if you don't like me but on the job i will treat you with respect i expect you to treat the customers with respect and also all of your fellow employees including me if you can't do that you need to find another job give it a couple more days and if you haven't gotten any inprovement make a formal written complaint to the manager good luck  Theory of conduct Social rule Singlish Software engineering Extreme Programming The Apprentice 2 Past teachings of Prem Rawat Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The nature of God in Western theology Health insurance Cliff Richard I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Shaggy dog story Gender-neutral language Avenue Q Outsourcing Charles Goodyear Haven (TNG episode) Customs and etiquette of Japan Unemployment Pip (South Park episode) John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism W.

since i have been unemployed i am so tired why is this i try to keep myself as structured as possible while looking for another job however by or in the afternoon i am beat somedays i can't keep my eyes open my physical health is suffering i used to exercise daily now i am so exhausted all the time i don't have the erergy i always feel like i am in a cloud i try to exercise but it isn't a matter of motivation i really do feel too tired why could this be it seems to be worse these last few weeks i don't have insurance and am not going to the doctor i just wanted to see if anyone else who is unemployed has ever felt this way and if it is normal that's exactly how i feel like driving with the brakes on i never seem to get un tired i never seem to completely wake up then when it comes to evening i don't want to go to bed even if i am tired it's so weird it's like i'd rather be doing other things and can't quite make myself go it isn't boredom i have a ton of stuff to do i am looking for a job hours per day which is almost a job in itself consider everything related diet and how well you're sleeping at night tie right in with exercise your exercise doesn't have to be vigorous to start going for a walk is easy and if you can get out in nature it wouldn't hurt don't do it based on if you feel like it or not just do it medically i simply don't know enough to say what could cause that i just suggest doing something that gives you a sense of purpose do what you enjoy and stay optimistic flow from one activity to the next act like you're not tired even if you feel like you are when you don't have an obligation your body might start taking advantage of that you don't have to be up so change that create obligations for yourself and make it strict not sending mixed signals to your body that you can cop out at any time set goals for yourself if you have to schedule your day the day before or do it weekly so that each day you have things to get done and don't have to think twice about what they may be i hope you start feeling energized soon if you are feeling depressed about your job situation i encourage you to find a solution you like not just one that will get you by there are other options besides selling your time for a wage and if those options give you that fiery feeling in your gut like they do for me it may be just what you need to get a little pep in your day  Unemployment Social rule Prostate cancer Labour economics Theory of conduct EastEnders Poker jargon Avenue Q Procrastination Clinical depression Shaggy dog story Sin City Insomnia Urinary incontinence Milton H.

is it a bad idea to use leave time after giving a two week notice i'm not talking about leave time that can be cashed out after termination i'm talking about use it or lose it leave time on one hand i could see how it might look bad on the other hand i earned that leave time and don't want to lose it what are your thoughts it really depends on how important it is to you to leave your current organization on a good note if you have any interest in returning to the company or if you think you may need your supervisor to provide you a reference at some point i really don't recommend it it also kind of depends on how much time you're talking about if you're talking about calling in sick or using a personal holiday one day during your two week notice that's one thing it's another thing entirely to use several days or a week's worth of time the whole point of the week notice period is to give your employer a resource to keep things running until they can replace you and to give them enough time to learn as much as they can from you if you're not actually there than the whole week thing doesn't really do them any good on the other hand you're not actually required by any laws or anything to give two weeks notice at all it's just a courtesy that's customary to extend so at the end of the day it's up to you you may want to check before doing anything though as some companies have begun to refuse to pay outstanding vacation time to employees that don't work a two week notice period i would check with hr before you miss any days  Microeconomics Annuity Theory of conduct Social rule Wheel of Fortune Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Supply and demand Extreme Programming Ra (board game) Scientology beliefs and practices Philosophy of language The Joker's Wild Unemployment benefit Unemployment Tax Leasehold estate The nature of God in Western theology Warren Buffett Karma Health insurance Copyright Prostate cancer Life insurance Flat tax Sheepshead Insurance Draw poker Inflation Chess strategy and tactics Public domain Graduate school Credit card Mutual fund Payroll Apprenticeship National Football League Objective-C Ocean's Twelve Spanish verbs Drug test Pyramid (game show) Computer virus Game programming Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Grade (education) Air traffic controller The Amazing Race Wal-Mart Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Hash table C plus plus Winning Streak $ale of the Century CPU cache Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bond Hey Jude Redundant array of independent disks Mojave people Taxicab Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Education in Germany National Insurance Web crawler 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Screenwriting Traumatic incident reduction Trade union Good Times Jennifer Lopez Royal Assent Betting (poker) The Catcher in the Rye Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Goodness and value theory Non-aggression principle Intellectual property Evan Mecham Milton H.

why didnt i get the job so there was a new target branch opening locally my credentials were ok even tho i didnt have much retail experience the interview was complete bs the questions were annoying and painfully general and i had to give generic answers apparently i didnt get in was it because i said i could do part time only they asked me about full time committment about twice it had to do with your availability that's funny because target stores are always requesting part timers for evenings and weekends and hardly ever full time but this may have been the exception remember next time you have an interview regardless of what your availability is turn their boring generic questions with great answers keep in mind attitude is also an important aspect  Social rule Jeff Gannon GED Toastmasters International Have I Got News For You You Don't Know Jack Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Quizbowl I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Little Britain Plame affair timeline MTV2 Family Feud Probation officer The nature of God in Western theology Downing Street memo Canadian House of Commons The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Bowling for Columbine Dream Job (Season 2) Social psychology Scientology beliefs and practices Theory of conduct Target Corporation Karl Rove Economics Hollywood Squares Heinrich M__ller Education in Portugal Statistical survey The Doctor Dances Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Internet Group Management Protocol Creationism Final Fantasy magic Seinfeld RISC Plame affair Psychology Rove Live Halting problem Time Out of Mind Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Cognitive dissonance Milton H.

continue pursuing this company i had an interview with a company a few months ago and recently i rent a resume for a different job i feel like this company wants nothing to do with me based on how the interview went and also the way they've responded to me the new job posting was only up for days when i received a curt email back saying that they would contact me and i should not contact them for any further job interests then just a couple days ago i find out that a girl i know from school got an interview for the same job the job posting's been up for a week during the interview i was asked strange questions why do you think in this field being objective is important along with what is your favorite supervisor like did you ever deal with a coworker who wasn't pulling their weight and what happened to them i thought they would ask me extensively about my experience but instead they asked me only and the rest of them had to do with personality questions and other things i'd consider gossip i answered all their questions concisely and asked them a lot of questions about their company what their expectations are etc but every time i asked them one positive question about the company they asked me questions that seemed gossipy also they took weeks to get back to me about whether or not i got the job after my interview i have friends who tell me that because that company's mainly women they must have thought i came across as too aggressive and objective however with my current job i was the same way during the interview and i was hired the next day afterwards what gives this is a really good company with stellar benefits hours pay i'm wondering if i did something wrong what i was asked were not behavioral interview questions those questions are based on how you handled situations and resolve conflicts asking me what my favorite supervisor is like is very different from asking me what i think is good in a supervisor whatever happened to getting the job done well and finding a person to do that i recently had a review with my current company and was told that i did extremely well all while maintaining the same attitude that i displayed during the interview i know what behavioral interview questions are and whatever those people were asking you weren't those sorts of questions what kind of idiot asks what is your favorite supervisor like why would you ever want to put someone in a position like that playing favorites in the workplace has never been a good thing i wouldn't bother with that company anymore it seems that they are more concerned about keeping different personalities away than they are about being focused on getting work done you also mentioned that there are women there as well no offense to anyone but women can be really catty and gossipy and you didn't give them that vibe would you really want to work for a place like that look elsewhere  Social rule The Apprentice 2 Plame affair Theory of conduct Friends Shaggy dog story Time Out of Mind Mojave people Roswell UFO incident Avenue Q Ethics 2005 trial of Michael Jackson U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Kodocha Scientology beliefs and practices Plame affair timeline Little Britain Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Super Mario 128 Blood on the Tracks The Ashlee Simpson Show One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Downing Street memo God Emperor of Dune Blonde on Blonde Killian documents Sexual orientation Social psychology Extreme Programming 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Good Times Dilbert W.

unqualified boss what would you do my husband is the finishing supervisor for a custom cabinet shop he's been with them for almost three years with no problems about three weeks ago they hired a new shop supervisor he happens to be the owners daughters she works there too boyfriend he has management experience but has never worked in woodworking the problem is that he's telling my husband to do some things differently which is fine except that if he does these things jobs won't be correct the pieces will come back and my husband will have to re do them these are jobs that take days to complete like a house full of cabinets bookshelves trim etc yesterday he passed a job to my husband and the majority of the pieces were marked for the wrong color my husband pointed it out to him and it took an arguement for the supervisor to look at what he marked he had done it wrong the shop sup has called a meeting with my husband the owners and himself today to discuss my husbands attitude help there have been other problems with the supervisor also when pieces are correct and my husband has to send it back to fabrication the supervisor gives him attitude so many other things my husband is not a whiner not a complainer he's just generally a good employee who cares about the quality of work he does he feels like he's being sabotaged i don't think i've ever seen him so frusterated he wants to quit but should he do these jobs wrong like the supervosor is telling him to and have to do it over honestly he should start looking for another job if he is already being called upon about his attitude they had clearly already decided that he is an inflexible troublemaker who responds poorly to change and no matter what he does he will always have that hanging over his head if he wants to stay with this company he simply needs to do whatever this boss tells him to do he will probably have to work extra hours and correct this morons mistakes too eventually if he keeps messing up they will move this new guy into another role with the organization probably a promotion either way i would tell your husband that his number one job is to try to make this new guy look good anything else is going to get him fired and ruin his shot at a good recommendation the plan is probably to move this guy up the ladder into and higher position and maybe leave the company to him and the daughter after they get married it is completely not fair but it is clearly the direction they have decided to go this is not about business this is about ensuring a secure future for the owner's daughter blood is thicker than water look at the bright side maybe the girl will break up with this doofus but i would suggest that he look for another job this new boss doesn't like him and i would bet that in ten years he will be the owner at this point you only choice is whether it would it be better to look for a job now or then as for the suggestions that he keep a paper trail that is only applicaible is he gets unjustly fired and he sues when you sue for worngful termination you are technically suing to get your job back if he chooses this path he will ruin his good name and waste a ton of time also the case will probably not be very strong as they are already creating a paper trail against him the talk about his attitude and the judge will be more likey to believe them i am sorry it sucks to feel like someone else has all the power in a situation but in this case i would say you would lose money face and time by trying to fight the system easier to shoose to leave now than throw it all away fighting to maintain a lost working situation  Friends EastEnders Social rule Knots Landing The Apprentice 2 Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Graduate school Pitaten Avenue Q Chess strategy and tactics Corporate governance Michael Garibaldi New York Giants Craps Sin City Scientology beliefs and practices Plame affair Extreme Programming Phoebe Halliwell 2000 Australian Grand Prix Boston Public Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Everwood Wal-Mart Chess terminology Principal-agent problem Alcoholics Anonymous Eric Bischoff Transactional analysis Time Out of Mind Gender-neutral language Jumpstart 3rd Grade Aerial (dance move) Kurt Angle Alex Ferguson U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Bulk vending The Critic Springfield Nuclear Power Plant Software engineering The Contender (television series) Textile manufacturing CPU cache 1957 World Series Hey Jude New England Patriots Upholstery Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim One Tree Hill (TV series) Shawn Michaels Michael D.

how can i make a resume how can i make my own resume i dont know how to because i am how should i write it what should i include can you pliz give me some tips besides setting all margins to the most important criteria for setting up a professional resume besides relevant text is scanability here are some helpful tips place just below your identification header your hame address phone email address any conditional warning statement such as confidential resume do not contact current employer etc always fill in an objectives category just below the conditional warning statement and make sure that he objective will contribute to the profitability of your future employer select a mono type font such as helvetica arial courier or times roman do not select any cursive handwriting styles which cannot scanned keep font sizes within a range of to pts avoid styling text with a justified alignment keep it flushed left instead of using tabs to set up blocked text entries generate a table and use the column and row settings accordingly do not place an i d picture anywhere on the resume this is a major taboo due to discrimination issues do not place any graphic text saved as gifs onto the resume since it may be overlooked during the scanning phase list at the very end of the resume your interests which should include travel experiences language skills social interactions such as golf team sports tennis etc in conclusion the above helpful hints were designed to allow ease of scanning of your resume into pdf which can then be text captured for seach purposes by your potential employer if the original resume was created in word wordperfect or mac appleworks it can be saved as a pdf file which then can be saved as an email attachment otherwise you can simply use a scanner and scan a hard copy of the resume and then save as a pdf file failure to conform the resume to appropriate fonts and styles as outlined above will result in rejection of the resume simply due to the inability of the scanning device to properly index relevant resume entries good luck  Typeface Killian documents Gmail HTML element EIA-708 TrueType Portable Document Format Unicode Computer virus OpenDocument CPU cache Apple typography C programming language PostScript Ebook ALGOL 68 WordPerfect Google HTML Cyrillic alphabet Virtual memory Opera (web browser) International Phonetic Alphabet Python programming language Enterprise content management PNG ASCII art Stopping e-mail abuse Cascading Style Sheets Atari 8-bit family E-mail Perl Emacs Screenshot Windows Vista British national identity card Magnetic resonance imaging Plame affair Computer Pretty Good Privacy IPod Macromedia Flash File Allocation Table Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus System/36 Anonymous remailer Icon programming language Windows XP Digital photography Objective-C Intelligent design movement Medical prescription File format Euro Geographic information system Palanca Awards Microsoft Blog Compiler optimization Password Stuttering Mach kernel Arabic alphabet REBOL Chinese character Optical character recognition SCO-Linux controversies Dot matrix printer Computer forensics Logo programming language Insurance Typewriter HyperCard Apple Computer Unicode and HTML Musical Instrument Digital Interface Tennis Screenwriting Requirements analysis Web page Mouse (computing) Baptism QuickDraw QuickDraw GX Hash table Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Business continuity planning Database SQL

what is the silliest reason you quit a job i quit a job because they had me sitting in the coldest part of the office directly under an air conditioning vent that never seemed to shut off after buying an electric blanket and a heater fan would not keep me warm and many complaints from them about me not being at my desk i thought it best for us both that i quit i had politely asked them to move me to a warmer location but they all acted as if that were impossible even though there were tons of empty desks in much warmer areas of the office i only lasted two weeks i had an employee quit because i sold some childrens dvd movies she was wanting to get for her child the child wasn't even born yet she was months pregnant i told her by the time her kid is old enough to watch the movies dvds will be obsolete and we will be watching disney movies some other way  HVAC EastEnders Married... with Children Climate of the United Kingdom Quarashi Shaggy dog story Knots Landing Futurama (TV series - season 5) Paul Is Dead Carl Barks The Inside IBM PC compatible Marilyn Monroe Anime Oasis (band) Ben Johnson (athlete) Friends Charmed Pok__mon (anime) Clay Aiken SpongeBob SquarePants Fan (implement) Carburetor The Apprentice 3 Mickey Mouse Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Kill Bill Blonde on Blonde Television in the United States Whose Line Is It Anyway?

what are the chances the company i work for from home has gone into liquidation i received a short phone call on tuesday night saying the company had ceased trading and i was redundant my question is at years old what are the chances of me working again your chances of working again are huge is not old first you need to change your perception of yourself because if you hold the belief that is 'over the hill' and that it will be hard to get a job then you will emanate that and help create that reality instead focus on how much you have to offer simply living for those years has given you wisdom insight and experience with the challenges life brings second focus on your passions what would you love to do in today's world people change careers frequently and being and doing it has become quite a normal thing by following your passions you'll be living out your life purpose and will be successfully employed whether it be self employed or employed by others and whether it be home based or not if you're not sure of your passions and or having difficulty overcoming these self limiting beliefs then a life coach would be a great investment think of this as a wonderful opportunity to create a life you love  God Philosophy Eucharist Insurance Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief A Course In Miracles Al-Ghazali Simone Weil Intelligent design Epistemology Objectivist philosophy Anthroposophy Carlos Castaneda Strategic management Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Afterlife Jon Secada Inflation ITV Duties of the Heart Creationism Game programmer Western philosophy Past teachings of Prem Rawat Socrates Meaning of life Capital accumulation Origin belief Immanuel Kant The nature of God in Western theology Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Philo Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Redundant array of independent disks S__ren Kierkegaard Philosophy of mathematics Extreme Programming H.

new job big problem i have currently recieved a promotion as a manager at a fairly large retail store and noticed that two other managers are showing poor management skills one manager is extremley rude and disrespectful to the employees she screams at them in front of customers and expects them to finish impossible tasks the other is stealing merchandise and is having her family buy things for her while she is working which is strictley against store policey i am not the type to tattle but i think something should be said to the supervisor considering i just started the position should i wait till the supervisor catches them or pretty much be a big tattle if it is a fairly large store they must have a personnel department they are equipped to handle both problems there are legal ways to handle these problems and you shouldn't try to handle them yourself i would simply write a letter to the personnel department and tell them that it embarrasses you to see a manager being disrespectful the disrespectful manager may just need a little training theft is another matter and should only be handled by trained personnel don't get involved personally you may be wrong i would write the letter and give the department names but please don't sign it  Electronic commerce Wal-Mart Call centre Theory of conduct Floppy disk Retailer Plame affair Trailer Park Boys Social rule Tag Bulk vending Incident Command System Construction The Apprentice 2 Grand Theft Auto (game) Management 2000 Australian Grand Prix Chess strategy and tactics Ocean's Twelve Poker jargon Outsourcing Sears Holdings Corporation Best Buy Inventory Computer Shaggy dog story Internet fraud MapleStory Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland Burial Division of labour Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina The Apprentice 3 Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Eaton's Florida Central Voter File Extreme Programming Warez Department store Computer virus Pointer Management information system Negima Diseconomies of scale Target Corporation Union Pacific Railroad Beavis and Butt-head CPU cache 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Aerial (dance move) Classified information Bicycle lighting Dyslexia Education in the People's Republic of China Customer relationship management Cheating in Counter-Strike Hong Kong Police Force Norway national football team Theodicy Password Freeters Security guard Canadian Tire Computer numbering formats Spring operating system Secretar__a de Inteligencia CPU design Craps Risk management New York City Police Department Spice Girls Criticism of libertarianism Royal Air Force Animal Crossing Data mining United Parcel Service Debugging Japanese toilet Surveillance Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse M60 machine gun Ashton-Tate Contract Spidey Super Stories Copland My Little Pony Qur'an desecration controversy of 2005 Microsoft The Bill Scientology beliefs and practices Sega Saturn Shopping Fry's Electronics Utility cycling Time Out of Mind Digital rights management Sandy Koufax Microeconomics

big delimma with boss i have always felt distant with my manager and i thought in the beginning she didn't like me becaue i was late and she was telling me to do things when i thought there was nothing to do lately we have been talking to eachother making small talk and jokes but today we were putting things away knapsacks pencil cases lunch boxes at accessory store and she pushed a bag off the counter and it slide hitting my face i held my cheek and looked shocked as she laughed she than later threw a bag in my direction and a couple of pencils cases on the floor i felt like crap she than made a joke about me and co worker us both being late and the only difference is she works i work just as hard and made big contributions to this place i want to know what to do and how to approach her about today i don't want to pretend nothing happened i want to confront her btw our store is closing in days and i wanted to ask her for a reference s she sounds like my old boss i confronted her on certain things and guess what lol i ended up leaving the same day without a reference so think before you say something you'll regret if i were you i would ask her for that reference today and if you dont get the reference you want it would be wise to get the phone numbers of your collegues and have them listed on your cv as referees at my old job instead of getting references employees who were leaving were issued with work certificates which showed the date of employment and date of termination etc you could ask your boss to sign off on one of those and have a collegue be your referee instead of hoping to get a reference full of good words from her also im in australia and thats a classic case of workplace bullying unfortunately i didn't have the guts to take it any further good luck though and i hope everything works out for you  EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Craps Friends Ocean's Twelve Dilbert The Catcher in the Rye Poker jargon The Ashlee Simpson Show Knots Landing George Costanza Columbine High School massacre Time Out of Mind Jennifer Lopez Reservoir Dogs Fancy Crane Ty Cobb Milton H.

if a mailed paycheck has not been received what should the employer do the employer said it takes days to put a trace on mailed items but isn't it their responsibility to make sure employees are paid timely how long should an employee have to wait and especially since the check may never come they have the correct address so that wasn't the problem yes i live very close by and can pick it up i only asked them to mail it because i was on vacation and couldn't get there they expect me to keep waiting i guess but no can do they probably don't want to pay the stop payment fee in my opinion the employer should issue another check and stop payment on the one that was mailed previously obviously something is amiss here are you sure they even mailed it  United States Postal Service Internet fraud Social Security (United States) Domain Name System E-mail Unemployment benefit Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Advance fee fraud Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Opera (web browser) Mail fraud Credit card Wal-Mart 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Annuity The Amazing Race Spam (electronic) Health insurance CPU cache Shaggy dog story Plame affair Poker jargon GED Insurance Surveillance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Schabir Shaik Trial Publicly funded medicine National Kidney Foundation Singapore Drug test Royal Mail Probation officer FairTax E-mail spam Social rule Identity theft Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Call centre Rick Santorum Evan Mecham Keynesian economics Hotmail Mutual fund Direct marketing Milton H.

how to handle an employee who is looking for another job i have a strong feeling that a person who is in a management position with my company is looking for another job the person would be leaving at a pivotal time of year for the company although they have not formally said anything their work has become uncharacteristic and sloppy i don't want to trouble the waters but i need to look out for what is in the best interest of the business what should i do i think i am more interested in the fact of me replacing the candidate i agree they are not worthkeeping with their current attitude i would really have to have someone on standby to step in their position i understand they have the right to look for better employment but do i have to right to look for someone while they are looking confront them about their quality of work as of lately and question their commitment to the company the drop in work quality could be due to many factors though it does not necessarily mean they are looking for employment elsewhere ask them about it and maybe you will get to the root of the problem maybe they are unhappy about thing around the office and it is taking a toll on their performance just schedule a talk and if they are looking for other employment at least you will know for sure and can begin your search for a replacement ahead of time i would say communicating with them is the key  ITV ISO 9000 Infantilism Graduate school Employment Unemployment Anarchism and capitalism Strategic management Dynamic Systems Development Method Infant baptism Customer relationship management Goodness and value theory 1957 World Series Economic inequality Trade union Liberal Democrats (UK) Microsoft Extreme Programming Abortion debate Gender-neutral language Corporate governance Social rule Call centre Plame affair Capital accumulation Information Technology Infrastructure Library Freeters Publishing Education in the People's Republic of China Non-native pronunciations of English U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Enterprise content management Scientology beliefs and practices Current teachings of Prem Rawat Labour economics Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses Software engineering Friends Polyamory Simone Weil Autism Agent handling Outsourcing Collision detection Peleliu Theory X and theory Y Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Gross domestic product Philosophy of business Reliability engineering Causality Transport Workers Union of America Workplace democracy Drug test Green Party of Canada World Wrestling Entertainment Requirements analysis 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Risk management Receptionist Incarnations of Immortality Public-key cryptography Rational Unified Process Electronic commerce Open access Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Criticisms of socialism PRINCE2 Enron Corporation Principal-agent problem Halting problem Domain Name System Cyprus dispute Characters in the Smurfs Jordan Grand Prix Panama Canal Pretty Good Privacy Transactional analysis New York Giants The Apprentice 2 Air traffic controller Boston Public Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Scientific method Jayson Blair Business process reengineering Inflation Health insurance Expert system President of Germany Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Theory of conduct Polynomial Donald Rumsfeld Homosexuality and Christianity Whose Line Is It Anyway?

how soon after an interview should i call to follow up i just interviewed for a great job and i fit perfectly for the position it's only been days since the interview i'm just eager to know should i wait a little longer as a hiring manager i think it is important to follow up with a call on the rd day after the interview sending a note is a great idea but there were times when we had it narrowed down to equally qualified candidate that the job went to the person that showed the initiative to make another contact reaffirming their interest i also think it's a good idea to call because i remember a specific instance where someone didn't get the job and called back to ask what they could have done differently in the interview or how they could have updated their skills that we actually met with them again and hired them for another opening employers love people who are actually excited about a job instead of seeing themselves as a no brainer kind of hire no one wants to hire an egomaniac with some sense of entitlement so i'd definitely call good luck  Social rule Plame affair Job interview The Apprentice 2 Time Out of Mind Norway national football team Affirmative action Coercion Graduate school Requirements analysis Predestination Human sexual behavior Call centre Software engineering Peter Singer Intelligence quotient Color Dog agility The Apprentice 3 Poker jargon Professor Labour economics Unemployment Meat Loaf Air traffic controller Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Labor theory of value Pretty Good Privacy Theodicy Education in the People's Republic of China Economic inequality Donna Moss Theory of conduct Microeconomics Star Wars live-action TV series Education in Germany Anarchism and capitalism Stanton Macdonald-Wright Flat tax Unemployment types Principal-agent problem Gender role Betting (poker) Jack Charlton Baseball Workplace democracy Utilitarianism Domain Name System Steve Jobs Incident Command System Republic Compensation of employees Karl Rove Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Freeters Tide Public-key cryptography Fuzion Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Ocean's Twelve Morse Code Consensus decision-making Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Paralegal Outsourcing Political decoy Civil rights The Book of Five Rings Edward VIII of the United Kingdom The Shining (film) The Ashlee Simpson Show Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 6 Volleyball Independence Party (Iceland) Management Knots Landing Cheating in poker Employment Therion (band) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Microsoft Lincoln-Douglas Debate 1957 World Series Inheritance (computer science) Killian documents Anarchism and society Francis Hutcheson (philosopher) Religious Society of Friends Good Times Waking the Dragons Surreal number Academia Eric Bischoff Past teachings of Prem Rawat Godspell George W.

should i call in and ask during my kmart interview i was told that i should be expecting a call back in a week or two it's been a week or so should i just wait a little longer for a call back or should i call in and see what's going on it's hard to say some employers see you calling as a bother while others see it as ambition i would wait until the time they said they'd call you and then call them don't do it in a bothersome way maybe make something up and say you were out of town and were afraid that maybe you may have missed the call just seem polite but driven to have the job that's what i'd do  Sears Holdings Corporation Shaggy dog story Sleeping Murder Wal-Mart Poker jargon Back to the Future Eddie Guerrero Redundant array of independent disks Rain Man Ocean's Twelve The Jazz Singer Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Good Times The Smoking Room Working time Whip (politics) Martha Stewart Big Brother UK series 6 Target Corporation Jennifer Lopez Time Out of Mind Health insurance George Michael Car handling Milton H.

state job how long and also question about salary had an interview two weeks ago for a small division within the state government department has people total and was told to either call back or she might get with me first so that friday she sent me an email saying there were two possible candidates and i was one they would decide monday thats a week and a half ago now and send off the paperwork to the hr department she said she will call the candidate with the offer as soon as it is approved by hr so how long does it take a state hr department to approve paperwork on a chosen applicant also she said that the salary is determined by the hr department and that it is not her choice i have done some research and found that almost every new hire in our state is paid the midpoint salary of their classification so whenever she calls does that mean i should accept whatever salary or should i attempt negotiation i have been working for years at only an hour so i'd be ok with the low end even but more is good in most states there is no opportunity for negotiation be happy this is not a federal job which usually starts people at the low point if the salary is not what you want you can ask is the salary open to negotiation but be prepared for a no once you get in you may be able to make up the low salary once you are out of the probationary period and pass your first review good luck to you  Canadian House of Commons The Apprentice 2 Economic inequality Professor Graduate school United States House of Representatives National Football League Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus British House of Commons Education in Germany Unemployment benefit Kyoto Protocol Publicly funded medicine Michael D.

visual communication interactive media i have a few questions about flyers brochures vacation magazines regular magazines etc is that interactive media what would visual communication interactive media involve i would like to know is this a good field to go into and can anyone go into this field as long as its something you think you would enjoy doing in other words do you have to know how to draw any info would be very helpful i would like to hear from ppl that hold a degree in this field and ppl currently attending school for this major also if anyone knows someone else that is involved in visual communication interactive media please feel free to make several comments and share experiences about the person that you know who is involved with interactive media i would to know the pros and cons thanks so much in advance while flyers brochures magazines and the like are by the literal meaning of the word interactive interactive media this term typically refers to digital projects such as websites and hands on applications like information kiosks a degree in visual communications interactive media especially if it is an associates degree will focus on both the print and web side of design allowing the student to choose their passion and lean towards traditional or digital media i personally hold a degree in visual communications and it's served me very well over my career i've had a steadily increasing salary and never much difficulty finding a job because of my diverse skill set and in my opinion the only reason to choose a career is to enjoy it especially as a creative you do not need to be a fine artist but an ability to sketch and clearly depict your ideas on paper before jumping onto a computer is a very valuable tool overall the most important skills for any designer at the start are a solid foundation in the necessary computer programs i e photoshop illustrator indesign for print and dreamweaver for web and conceptual thinking these two things along with a well groomed student portfolio will get you your first job in the industry then a healthy knowledge of art history a thick skin and working long hours will get you a promotion and great salary the major cons any creative field is cutthroat be prepared to be criticized and put your ego aside you will be competing with many many talented people who seem better qualified for the position companies are looking to hire jacks and jills of all trades for as little money as possible the major pros your degree in visual communications will teach you a variety of skills that can be applied to almost any industry creative or not if you learn the computer programs you will never be out of work well paying temp agencies are always looking for qualified talent the real decision to make get the education in what you love college is not the final step in choosing a career  Education Software engineering Game programmer Homeschooling Computer Graphic design Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Graphics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economics Computer-aided design Open source culture Apple Macintosh Microsoft Nurse Advertising World Wide Web Intellectual property Scientology beliefs and practices Hacker El Lissitzky National Football League Adobe Photoshop Literacy MIT Media Lab Rudolf Steiner Lisp programming language Psychology Cyberspace Product Lifecycle Management Outsourcing Science Drawing No Child Left Behind Act Requirements analysis Otterbein College Editor Paralegal Academia Second language acquisition Salary cap Juris Doctor Python programming language Mathematics Anthroposophy Computer virus Community college Consensus decision-making Objectivist philosophy A Course In Miracles Public domain Digital art Education in Germany Dog agility Economic inequality Interactive fiction Minor league baseball Billboard (advertising) Management information system Windows Vista Computer-supported collaboration BASIC programming language Physical attractiveness Logic Psychoanalysis Expert system Web design Blog Franz Boas Philosophy Marshall McLuhan Chinese University of Hong Kong The Apprentice 2 Computer science Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Computer and video game genres Workplace democracy Peer review Education in Romania University of Massachusetts Amherst

i just quit my new job and they keep calling me what to do i just quit a design job that i started about a month ago and decided that it wasn't the right job for me i started at a busy time they gave me so much work and so little training that i was doing it blindly the company is very disorganized and reminds me too much of my last job which i stayed at for years until i couldn't take the bs anymore the last thing i want to do is get myself into another position that makes me miserable also this job would have required me to relocate across the country now the people from the company keep calling me and telling me that i was the best person for the job and they don't understand why i quit and they keep asking if i'm sure about my decision i started at a bad time things won't always be this way and so on i am not reconsidering going back but i don't know what to tell them someone suggested going back this is not an option i played the same role in the last job that i had i was one of the only cheerful and helpful people in a company of miserable people who hated their jobs and hated the company i need to never do that again i cannot expect to make a company change their ways they made the statement that you were the best person they had you going back would be for their benefit not yours and i'd tell them that you don't need to sacrifice your well being just to make their life easier i would also tell them that you have no interest in relocating if they continue to call i wouldn't listen to them as soon as they started talking i would say i told you i'm not interested and hang up i personally wouldn't block thier calls although it's an option i would like them to hear it from me personally yes it rude but obviously they are being rude by continue to call they're as bad as telemarketers by the way congratulations are breaking out before it dragged you down good luck  Social rule Craps Kodocha Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) Theory of conduct Friends Knots Landing Carl Barks Fight Club Charmed Piccolo Junior Saga Past teachings of Prem Rawat The Smoking Room Phoebe Halliwell Cliff Richard 2000 Australian Grand Prix Alcoholics Anonymous George Harrison David Hume Unemployment The Apprentice 2 Sandy Koufax Plame affair Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Spice Girls Methos Kender Time Out of Mind The Shining (film) Married... with Children Pitaten Current teachings of Prem Rawat Labour economics The Amber Spyglass Satchel Paige Blonde on Blonde Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Poker jargon Sydney Riot of 1879 Waking the Dragons The Ashlee Simpson Show Milton H.

i showed up for a job interview one week early i'm mortified i must have mis read the email do i have a chance in answering this it would help to know what the potential employer's reaction was to your unexpected arrival i know that if i were the one who had been doing the scheduling i would be just as worried that my email to you had stated the wrong date were they okay with it at the time did they laugh it off or did they just say see you next week in a humorless kind of way as an employer who interviews people all the time i can say that i would not necessarily take it as a bad sign that someone came in on the wrong date i've had people show up hours late for appointments and i rejected them immediately because it made it look like they didn't want the job very much you at least come off looking like you are eager to have the job better a week early than an hour late i say the best consolation i can give is to say that you should go by their reaction if they were okay and amused then you should not worry even if they looked at you askance go in on your regularly scheduled date and wow them i would even make some joke about it as you go in to show that you're not afraid to admit when you made a mistake  Plame affair Social rule Shaggy dog story EastEnders Television syndication Johnny Carson The Ashlee Simpson Show Killian documents Jeopardy!

my boss is awful to me if i'm out but doesn't even question my co workers with kids how do i address this i always get good reviews and hardly ever miss work but i had to call in today b c i'm sick my boss was really hostile she said that i better be there tomorrow she never says anything to the pregnant women in our office even when they call in because they just don't feel like coming in or they're late b c they're tired although they've missed far more days than me she also lets women w kids off w o question it's like she's punishing me for not having children i don't know how to address this with her i've recently started looking for another job but i still want to tell her how unfair this is any advice this is a tough one to address and it's always difficult to criticize a boss but i'm with you she is treating people differently and needs to be made aware of it schedule an appointment with her start by discussing your performance is everything ok are you meeting her expectations etc once she tells you as we hope she will that you're a strong performer on the job then you have some leverage to approach the time off situation something like boss i've noticed when shelly and susie need time off to attend to their kids or because they don't feel well that seems to be acceptable to you however when i ask for time off it feels like you're really upset with me since you've just told me that you think highly of my performance i'm at a loss to understand why you would be so concerned over an occasional sick day is it because i don't have children or is there another reason i should be aware of then sit quietly and let her backpedal her way out of this one of course if you've been missing a lot of time or if your performance is not as strong as that of the other gals in the office you need to fix that problem before you can accuse your boss of disparate treatment good luck  Social rule Theory of conduct A Course In Miracles The Critic The Midnight Sun Sharon Tate Time Out of Mind The Inside Extreme Programming Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Alex Ferguson Milton H.

careers in woodworking and cabinets my husband has been working in custom cabinets for the past years he knows all phases from fabrication to install but has focused the last as the finish department manager at it's pretty clear that the pay is topped out already and for the most part we've yet to find a company that offers medical benefits of any sort he's also concerned about being exposed to all the paint fumes hours a week he enjoys what he does but is considering a change to hopefully earn what he's worth and get benefits to those of you who have experience in the woodworking field what can you tell me about careers in cabinets does the pay get better what about becoming a general contractor up's and down's of opening his own shop to do finishing and refinishing work he's exploring possibilities right now and he really wants to make a smart move where there is room to grow decent money and lots of work we would like our own business but 's an issue thanks i work for an hvac contractor the amount of work we have in any given month depends on what the housing market is doing the same would be true if your husband were a general or cabinetry contractor his best bet is to stick with cabinetry since he enjoys it but maybe open his own shop so homeowners can buy new cabinetry when they remodel their home and also provide contract services to general contractors who are building in the area as far as the money thing goes many banks will make loans to start a business but you can also get government grants for the same thing i've never tried getting a government grant so i can't tell you about the process but i have heard it can take a long time to get approval  Insurance ITV Student loan Bank Table saw Annuity Wal-Mart Mortgage United States Postal Service Extreme Programming Enron Corporation FairTax Woodworking Monetary policy Investment bank Primerica Financial Services Credit card Bank of China (Hong Kong) Wheel of Fortune American individualist anarchism Mutual fund Outsourcing Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Octopus card Poker jargon Unemployment Classified information Schabir Shaik Trial Microeconomics Gambling Product Lifecycle Management Graduate school Unemployment benefit Information Services Procurement Library Sears Holdings Corporation National Health Service Corporation Islamic banking Upholstery Electronic commerce Cabinet making United Kingdom corporation tax Education in the United States PE ratio Privatization Health insurance Construction Tesco Capital accumulation Temasek Holdings Derivative (finance) Price discrimination Blackjack Health care in the United States Financial services Money Government National Mortgage Association Personal finance Cooperative Capitalism Public good Inflation Economic inequality Kitchen Arturo Frondizi Bond Money supply Risk management Ethical consumerism Airbus Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Anarchism and capitalism Economy of the United States The Apprentice 2 Minimum wage Toronto-Dominion Bank Customer relationship management Sam Walton CPU design Microcredit Oil-for-Food Programme UK Singles Chart Animal Crossing Short selling Craps Mergers and acquisitions Debt Security (finance) Starbucks Contract Warren Buffett Finance Mainframe computer Plastic Information Technology Infrastructure Library

is nursing a better career than chef cook what do you think im confused i love to cook it's my passion working with my hands eating smelling cutting but i also like to help people feel better and cure them which one is better i'll be in grade in september i have to decide fast please help i dont know where to go after high school or where to go can you please list some advantages and disadvantages that you think these jobs have either chef cook nurse or law clerk correction where to go or what to do as a disadvantage both careers involve long hours working nights weekends holidays when everyone else is off and are physically demanding although i'm a cook and my aunt is a nurse i think both jobs have their advantage in that you are directly affecting peoples' lives whether you feed them or help heal them you'll make better money as a nurse but you need less formal training and education to be a cook with both jobs you may face shifts of up to hours and who knows when you'll get a break just to sit down with both jobs you'll have a very high level of responsibility if you mess up there is a potential to seriously hurt someone with both jobs you can have the personal satisfaction from meeting the challenges of the day oh and there is a difference between being a cook and a chef it all depends on how much paperwork you're willing to do how many hours you want to work despite being salaried instead of paid by the hour how many years are you willing to apprentice yourself for low pay and how well you handle being a supervisor give it lots of thought talk to your family friends school advisors they'll help you choose the right direction as for the schools to attend that depends on where you live and what tuition you can afford nursing programs are found at and year schools as are culinary programs good luck  Graduate school Pitaten Social rule Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus EastEnders Education in Germany Nurse Affirmative action Tuition Education in Australia Baseball Education in Romania Nursing Division of labour Student loan Supply and demand The Apprentice 2 Education in Portugal Microeconomics Principal-agent problem Appeal RuneScape skills Extreme Programming Breastfeeding T'Pol Education in Hong Kong Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Restaurant Inflation Characters in the Smurfs Juris Doctor W.I.T.C.H.

how long does it take for a online application to seen by manager at a job it depends on quite a few factors what kind of job board are you posting to if it's monster or careerbuilder it could be that they never see it if you are posting directly to an email address at a company they may see it immediately it's best if you have the person's direct email to send a copy of your resume directly to them rather than posting if you don't have the luxury of knowing who this person is make sure you use key words used in the job announcement when responding in your resume these job boards are so large now that sometimes a computer program scans the resumes to see if the person even meets the qualifications and then if they don't the hiring person never even sees the resume good luck to you i hope you are the lucky one to get hired  E-mail Internet fraud Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Computer virus Computer Pretty Good Privacy E-mail spam Stopping e-mail abuse Gmail Advance fee fraud Plame affair Password Coalition Provisional Authority Phishing Public domain SCO-Linux controversies Spam (electronic) Internet forum United States Postal Service Michael D.

really bad at writing resumes so i'm in the market for a new job i need one desperately i'm very unhappy where i am now but i'm not so good at writing a resume i did the whole resume builder thing but i just feel as though i need to beef it up any suggestions i have had occasion to interview people in the past and based on that and merely by talking with other people who do hiring the resume is overrated by most people it carries weight but not in the way that people think the sole object of the resume is simply to convey clearly and understandably what the nature of your employment history is there are many too many books and articles written on the subject of resumes and cover letters you should be able to get as much specific information as you need and more from them the basic idea is to be clear be direct follow the generally accepted format explain any gaps or other irregularities in work history and of course never lie a little white lie can get you fired years later and it will then become a permanent black hole in your employment record generally the employer is trying to figure out what kind of worker you are in the context of the job you are applying for try to put yourself in the shoes of the manager if you had to hire people for the job what would you be looking for try to frame your experience in previous jobs in a way that highlights the kind of experience you know a particular employer will be looking for i said that the resume does not carry the weight that people think if you have adequate qualifications for the job you will be called in for an interview no employer makes any final decisions before the interview in fact the interview is just about everything there is information about a person that you can get from an interview that you can never get from a sheet of paper before the interview everything is up in the air no matter what font your resume is typed in or what kind of paper it is printed on so what about the resume it simply gets you in the door by showing that you have the proper qualifications for the job if you've got the qualifications as long as the resume is passable you don't have to worry about beefing it up you have only to worry about screwing it up while an employer really doesn't care how much fudge you put on your resume glaring mistakes as improper spelling punctuation or other if the resume is difficult to read it will really start you off on the wrong foot along with the resume is the cover letter again there are many books out there but generally it should not go over one page and it should convincingly convey to your employer that you are qualified and able to do the job excellently and you are very personally interested in the job and would love to get it in the interview you should convey these same points again a resume and cover letter are generally memorable to an employer only if they are particularly bad no matter what is written down on a sheet of paper the interview is for all the marbles  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theory of conduct Plame affair Goodness and value theory Black hole Killian documents Unemployment Deconstruction Friends Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Appeal Sydney Riot of 1879 Social rule Economic inequality Milton H.

okay i've got three options i have no job and i'm going into junior year of high school i'm being moved up to college prep which is harder then where i was at before and i didn't do so great in college prep when i was in freshman year if i get a job it is just for pocket money i don't pay any bills or anything what should i do go to a supermarket days a week hours a night wait till i'm in december and work at blockbuster that's slightly better then the supermarket focus on my school work i heard junior year was important and i really need to bust my ass this year i worked at the supermarket for a year and a half was offered a job at a different place so i quit and got f'd over at the other place i gave them my weeks so they said i'm welcome back anytime i would definitely not choose you need to do homework after school and if there is no time you will not likely do it after work and i think it will make you tired is a better option but i would still just work weekends and you will not be so bogged down of course choice is the best option if you are planning to attend college which i recommend i would not work at all your last years of school i would wait till i got into college and work a few hours a week since you can controll your school schedule and your time i would however explain to your parents about the need for a set allowance if it is feasible and perhaps you could take on a couple of extra chores and i doubt this will interfere with your school work they will likely understand and be happy to help as long as you keep up the grades  Education in the United States GED Education in Romania Poker jargon Freeters Lynbrook High School Wal-Mart Education in Australia The Amazing Race Education in Germany Pitaten Education in Taiwan Independent school (UK) 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Catcher in the Rye Community college Rosa Parks Education in England Unemployment Bristol Grammar School High school National Football League International League Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Hunter College High School The Apprentice 2 Redundant array of independent disks Phillips Exeter Academy Student loan College admissions Ocean's Twelve No Child Left Behind Act The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Economics The Citadel (Military College) Student Prostate cancer Time Out of Mind Winning Streak The Inside Mutual fund Wheel of Fortune Secondary education in France EastEnders Moe Berg Knots Landing Bellarmine College Preparatory Advanced Placement Program Marching band SAT Craps Law School Admissions Test IB Diploma Programme Theory of conduct Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Blonde on Blonde Star Trek: Enterprise Pyramid (game show) Policy Debate Avenue Q Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Beatmania IIDX John Kerry Blackjack Luther Head Babe Ruth Royal Assent James T.

any advice please ok yesterday i went for my second interview at a gym for a front desk position and it was a different manager but at the end he told me that he wanted to hire me and said that he just needed to go tell the other guy the one who interviewed me the first time to hire me well he said they would either be calling me last night which they never did or today sometime do you think he would lie to me and not hire me he was very nice and said he liked me alot and everything and he wants to hire me employers can't tell you that if they don't mean it and i will be so mad the reason i had a second interview is because i had to meet the other manager that i would be working with thats what the first guy told me so do you think they got busy or something calm down wait a day or so and call them nicely asking if you had misunderstood the situation and that they really weren't interested in hiring you if you are at the front desk you are going to meet a lot of demanding people some of whom won't like you because of something going on in their life you want to demonstrate your cool under fire rather than volatility with your call you will demonstrate good qualities establish that you are interested in the job and clarify that you intend to interview at other places if there is doubt about your being hired there good luck  The Apprentice 2 Reservoir Dogs Social rule Paul Is Dead The Contender (television series) Sharon Tate Late Night with Conan O'Brien George Costanza Plame affair Unemployment Eric Bischoff Call centre Steven Wright The Ashlee Simpson Show Time Out of Mind Cliff Richard Andrew Dice Clay The Apprentice 3 Ocean's Twelve Keynesian economics W.

is it ethical to leave this job i was head hunted for another position less stress less hours more money etc the position is actually a step down as far as responsibilities go i will be an analyst instead of a manager but the pay is so much better and there are fewer responsibilities and more perks my boss has been there for me personally and also helped my husband get a good position at her husband's place of employment after he my husband sold his business and was looking in a scarce local job market i feel bad about leaving especially since it will create a lot of stress on her to train someone to run the department so she is able to focus on her duties as senior management i know that this is the better choice for me but can't help but feel torn by my loyalty and gratitude toward my current boss any suggestions or words of wisdom thank you another part of the reason that i feel desperate to leave and really want to accept this new offer is that my current place has become a toxic work environment full of favortism in other departments and a corrupt ceo i fully intend to give weeks notice which is as much as i can and to offer to train in the evenings if needed but leaving her to deal with so much stress really makes it hard for me to accept this new position with the pleasure and excitement that i should give plenty of notice ask her what you can do to ease the transition and thank her in your resignation letter for everything she's done  Unemployment Economics Graduate school Ethics Management The Apprentice 2 Education in the People's Republic of China Wal-Mart Strategic management Microeconomics Corporate governance Scientology beliefs and practices Theory of conduct Investment bank Microsoft Professor EastEnders Plame affair Extreme Programming New Deal Clinical depression Babe Ruth Gift economy Outsourcing Poker jargon Economic inequality Tariff Free trade Social rule Capitalism Supply and demand Principal-agent problem British Civil Service Business ethics Warren Buffett 2004 Democratic National Convention Goodness and value theory Abortion G-Man (Half-Life) Morgan Stanley Salary Toronto Raptors Transactional analysis Boston Public Evil 2004 Republican National Convention Utilitarianism Non-native pronunciations of English Cork City F.C.

i'm and in th grade i am attempting to buy a car only have after saving everything for a year i can't get a real job bc i go to school and don't have much time with all my sports activities i know i don't have to pay all at once but i dont want to be paying on this thing for years my parents won't give me a dime towards it they say i need to earn it how can i earn more money i have sold every valuable thing i own on ebay and i babysit all the time i got all money for my sweet so that went into the dollars thanx for any ideas first off your doing great i know you are not even rd of the way there and it seems like you'll never have enough money but you are doing so much more than most people and i really admire the efforts you are making let me tell you a quick story not what you want but i think it will help just after finishing college i went to work at a large company making good money but i hated the work it was ok for some but i found it boring and i just couldn't get along with my boss i didn't feel like things would be any better at another company so i decided to save up to start my own business investing in real estate i studied real estate investing for years kept working at the job i hated and eventually started buying palces and fixing them up while still working the regular job after i started buying places i'd fix them up myself to save typically i'd get up go to work work until around then work on an investment property until midnight and work on the proeprty day each weekend go home fall exhausted into bed and repeat everything the next day the work was grueling i remember x mases eating at the only open restaurant the chinese restaurant as my family was 's of miles away but i wanted to stay in town to work on the property but many years later i saved up enough and made enough that i did quit my job now i'v made enough doning this that i am pretty well set but it took many years and was really really tough the point is thats what you have to do in life life isn't easy its challenging and you've got to work at it but keep with it and you will eventually meet your goal and it will be all the sweeter so great what you've done so far but if this is what you truly want just keep to it the lessons you learn accomplishing this will stick with you your whole life and put you ahead of of the other people out there sorry again i don't think this holds the ideas you were hooping for but i think the best advice is just to keep at it best luck  EastEnders Knots Landing Humphrey Bogart Warren Buffett Carl Barks 2000 Australian Grand Prix Poker jargon Avenue Q Insurance Theory of conduct The Amazing Race Kodocha Alex Ferguson Bond Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Apprentice 2 Evel Knievel Capitalism Bank The Critic Scrooge McDuck Internet fraud Donald Trump Charles Ponzi Capital accumulation Deflation (economics) Pitaten Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Great Teacher Onizuka Everwood James T.

what reason should i give to postpone a decision on a job offer i already have an offer from one company but i just did an onsite with another and waiting for their response how do i put off the first company for few more days till i hear back from the second company i am keen on joining the second company and also the pay of the first company is average negotiate with them a bit ask for some additional holiday time ask for some additional pay it will usually take them a day or so to respond to you be sure to not answer the phone when they are ringing so they have to leave a message and then dont respond until during the next day's business hours be sure to ask them about their fringe benefits and ask for a day or two to look those over and again ask some questions again as a stalling tactic ive used this method successfully a few times and can gernally stretch it out at least a week doing so and have managed over weeks before it also has the added side benefit of possibly resulting in a higher wage or more time off for you if you do take the position  Wal-Mart Social rule Unemployment Minimum wage Call centre London Congestion Charge Sydney Riot of 1879 Plame affair GSM services Microeconomics Breastfeeding Trade union Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Unemployment benefit Life insurance Ives Manufacturing Company Insurance Same-sex marriage in Canada Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Airline Operation Market Garden Air traffic controller In-N-Out Burger Principal-agent problem Walt Disney World College Program Yom Kippur War Jeopardy!

could a mba launch a career in the nfl could earning a mba get me a position in the front office of a nfl team i eventually would like to get on the field and coach i know take a lot of worked there are several universities that offer master's degrees in sports administration dual degrees with sports administration and an mba or an mba with a sports administration emphasis for example columbia university in new york city has a master's program in sports administration you can consider at the following link http www ce columbia edu masters courses cfm pid content curriculum however i believe you will have a very slim chance of ever making it to the field in the nfl as a coach if you start in the front office if you can find any such examples where that has happenned before i bet you could count them on one hand as a football fan you know story after story of coaches starting out as players or working their way up the ranks from high school or college coaching those are the more common roads to a job as an on the field coach in the nfl a couple of other things to keep in mind there are less than men playing professional football in this country of people that means only out of every people in this country has a chance to play in the nfl coaching in the nfl is probably a in shot and working in the front office of an nfl team is more like at in proposition you will have to be extremely dedicated tirelessly presistent and very lucky to get a job in an nfl front office obviously it can be done but it won't be easy best of luck  American football Master of Business Administration Cincinnati Bengals University of Houston University of Arizona Florida State University New York Giants Buffalo Bills University of Notre Dame University of San Francisco Arizona State University Georgia Institute of Technology Purdue University Minnesota Vikings Kansas City Chiefs New York Jets Pittsburgh Steelers National Football League Lore Columbia University Auburn University Vince Lombardi Carolina Panthers West Virginia University University of Florida University of Miami Joe Paterno American Football League Master's degree Cleveland Browns University of Pittsburgh Norway national football team George Halas San Diego State University Playoff Miami Dolphins Texas Longhorn Athletics Indianapolis Colts Pennsylvania State University University of Missouri - Columbia New England Patriots Super Bowl XXVII Tulane University University of Alabama University of Tennessee San Francisco 49ers Temple University Oklahoma State University - Stillwater Chinese University of Hong Kong University of Oregon Graduate school Indiana State University Super Bowl University of Arkansas Baseball Baltimore Ravens Education in the United States Jacksonville Jaguars Super Bowl XXV Tennessee Titans St. Louis Rams East Carolina University University of Hawaii World Football League California Polytechnic State University Jim Thorpe Washington University in St. Louis Joe Namath Donovan McNabb Texas Tech University University of Central Florida Herschel Walker Philadelphia Eagles Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University AFL-NFL Merger NFL Network Ivy League NFL Europe San Diego Chargers NFL Draft American football strategy Bud Adams Glossary of American football College football University of Nevada, Las Vegas Virginia Commonwealth University Cheerleading Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium Super Bowl XXVI Mack Brown

i want a new career i live in england and was a childminder for years i decided that i no longer wanted to have children in my home i would like to decorate and have nice things at below waist level so i have been a cleaner for the past year i would like to have a career now as i am only and my son is and will be leaving home education in years i thought i could possibly do some training in those two years but am finding courses very expensive and we just don't have spare cash does anyone know where i could go to get some advice i would rather speak face to face with someone rather than on the phone i need advice on what career i should chose c v's training and help with costs please help i want to learn and work thank you so much for taking th time to read this question and hopefully answer it pippa it really depends on your aptitudes and what you're willing to learn for example let's say you wanted to get into web design and yes i know it's flooded but there are many areas for specialization go to http webmonkey com and read all the articles you can some of the best training is right there and it's free go to http brainbench com and look at the tests available for different fields look at the outlines of the tests many of the tests are free take the ones you feel you're ready for it will be a good start and you can link to your certifications from a posting or an email sent to a potential employer sign up at http rentacoder com and start bidding on projects that match your new found skill be persistent and be prepared for an up hill battle at the start because like ebay there is a feedback rating system in place the higher your rating the more work you will get so be prepared to bid low at the start other quick tips make your profile as detailed as possible and include a photo people like to see who they're hiring visit your local craigslist and go to the computer gigs section for example http london craigslist org cgp you can follow links to your local area from there when you respond to an ad always include a link to your rent a coder resume profile the protective services like escrow and arbitration far outweigh the commission rent a coder gets like i said earlier there are many areas of specialization for web design here are a few writing content articles etc for web pages designed with search engine optimization seo in mind to get high listings for pages in ask google and yahoo designing css friendly web pages handy for modernizing older websites that still use tables for example flash web design even this has specializations like writing actionscript code or designing flash that talks back to web servers running script languages like php asp coldfusion become a trainer teaching individuals and companies how to use some of the most popular content management systems out there which are notoriously lacking in good documentation which can be to your benefit drupal joomla and wordpress are some of the more popular systems http drupal org http joomla org http wordpress org become an expert in setting up online stores for brick and mortar stores that do not yet have a web presence some popular shopping cart programs are oscommerce zencart and drupal's ecommerce module http oscommerce com http zencart com http drupal org project ecommerce finally as there are so many different specializations it's worthwhile to build a network of specialists and refer work to each other when the job at hand requires a skill you lack and don't have the time to learn and or your current schedule is such that you simply cannot take on another project right now and the client is on a tight schedule  PHP Website Blog Cross site scripting Search engine optimization World Wide Web Web crawler Mozilla Firefox Uniform Resource

isn't it better to start up a businees rather than working for others all this while since young i m always good in buying and selling of goods and services and i think i am good enough in business world so i never would try to think of getting started with any jobs i own a small boutique but i found it not reli profitable should i continue o should i need to find a job it depends on the business and what type of profit you can draw from it a job is obviously only paying you some fixed amount and no share of profits unless you have a job that has a profit share your own business may be wildly successful but it is much more risky the income may not be consistent you may fail here is the basic premise of risk and reward the riskier the undertaking or investment the more it should pay off but you also have much more downside you can lose it all the safer bet is to find a job which is less risky and less profitable but you reduce your downside  Arbitrage Insurance Capital accumulation Capitalism Islamic banking Surplus value Corporation Poker jargon Labor theory of value Gambling Gross domestic product Dot-com Blackjack Privatization Bond Annuity Dividend Principal-agent problem MMORPG Investment bank Free trade Mutual fund Debt Sports betting Income statement Bank Venture capital Keynesian economics Rational pricing Public good Deflation (economics) Citigroup Finance Outsourcing FairTax Business Income trust Microcredit Corporate finance PE ratio Monetary policy Ra (board game) Cable television Electronic commerce Extreme Programming ITV Mergers and acquisitions Health insurance Economy of Russia Economics Craps Short selling Hedge fund United Kingdom corporation tax Great Depression Risk Law of value Supply and demand Economic inequality Credit card Final Fantasy XI Modern portfolio theory Inflation Anarchism and capitalism Life insurance Unemployment Day trading Sweatshop Value added tax Capital asset pricing model Microeconomics Bretton Woods system Protectionism Real estate developer Baccarat Arguments for and against drug prohibition Economy of the United States Prices of production Tesco Philosophy of business Entrepreneur Betting (poker) Economic rent Airline Grand Theft Auto (game) Deficit spending American football Efficiency wages Intellectual property Graduate school 401(k) Progressive tax Animal Crossing Profit Interest Freeters Publicly funded medicine Fast bowling CPU design

how to become a publisher hi i want to become a publisher and eventually own my own publishing house however i have no idea of how to get into it or where to begin has anyone out there got any advice about where to start or any good references i could used online i did a search myslef but came up with nothing thanks in advance to any replies claire you'll have to move up the ladder of publishing and let me just forwarn you that it will be difficult the publishing business is hard to crack into right now and long hours and small pay is most likely in the future for you as you get into the business once you're in the upper echelon of a publishing house this will change though first off did you go to college already you'll need to go to school for english or journalism so you can apply for some entry level jobs in the publishing field while in school it would be good to work on some sort of publication newspaper magazine etc to gain some experience for your resume do internships at publishing companies while in school as well even if it's not required by your school it can only help you i work as an editor at a book publisher right now i got the job after graduating with a journalism degree this is an entry level position but that's because i live in a small city and there's not a lot of competition for these jobs if i was applying at a big publishing house in nyc for example i would never have gotten this job i would have had to start as an editorial assistant or administrative assistant you'll have to spend years in the industry working your way up before you can even think about becoming a publisher yourself there's so much to learn in this field and it wouldn't be smart to put out the money lots and lots of money it will require to start your own business before you know it well it will carry the same risks as starting any kind of business but it can be done with patience and dedication  Education in the United States Extreme Programming Columbia University Labor theory of value Editor Professor Publishing Academia American University Management information system Plame affair Medical school Oxford English Dictionary Peer review Unemployment Yearbook Physician W.

people denied a chance to a viable income is it just me or does something seem out of balance in the job market prospective applicants have to act like villagers from the middle ages seeking a favour from their liege lord the lord can deny the application because the petitioner was too hairy wasn't a good fit with our culture spoke with using poor grammar wore the wrong brand of socks and so on and so on the only feedback received in most cases is that your application was unsuccessful in this instance does that really mean anything other than p s off does something seem wrong with that picture we live in a free market capitalist society which i will also add is the most opportunity laden type of economic system ever to exist this type of system allows businesses the freedom to hire those applicants they feel will be beneficial to their business and not hire those they don't feel are qualified or may be detrimental to their business yes government regulations regarding racial age gender sexual orientation and religious discrimination have since restricted the freedoms of private businesses in their hiring practices however i believe the free market would have eventually regulated this on their own i personally would not give my business to a place i knew was discriminatory as i do not want to promote or fund that kind of behavior at the same time i may frequent a place less due to the looks of a business's employees for instance a probably would not enjoy my meal half as much if my waiter was incredibly hairy b c it's not very hygenic in the restaurant world it would probably ruin my appetite to see my unknowing waiter's long beard resting in my soup as he carries the bowl to my table in a perfect world people couldn't care less about how people look but this is reality we don't live in a feudal society we live in a society that provides you with the freedom to thrive the opportunity to keep trying if you fail the desire to better your lot in life and to seek out new opportunities when you tire of another anyone who is continuously denied employment needs to take a look at themselves to see why it may be that employers continuously pass them up do they need to shave cover up their tattoos further their education are they applying for jobs that require more experience than they have under their belts it's called taking responsibility instead of blaming one's misfortunes on everyone else that's the only way to succeed be truly happy b c then you know you have control over your life and your destiny is in your hands  Economic inequality Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Affirmative action Unemployment Gender role Microeconomics Capitalism Gay rights Sexual orientation Freedom of speech Democracy Separation of church and state Free trade Discrimination Human sexual behavior Education in the People's Republic of China Tax Civil rights Life insurance Criticism of libertarianism United Kingdom corporation tax First Amendment to the United States Constitution Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India European Convention on Human Rights Appeal Japanese tea ceremony Goodness and value theory Equal Protection Clause Trade union Public good Infantilism Theory of conduct Feminism Extreme Programming Education in Portugal Abortion debate Social justice New Deal Ten Commandments Corporation Free market French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Poker jargon Theodicy Education in the United States Software engineering Health insurance Simone Weil Transsexuality Strategic management Insurance Publicly funded medicine Numerus clausus Altruism Taxation in the United States Guild The Apprentice 2 Anorexia nervosa Value system Constitution of Ireland Minimum wage Same-sex marriage in Canada Coercion Nudism Anarchist economics American individualist anarchism Immigration to the United States Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Israeli Arab Expert system Keynesian economics Public policy Wal-Mart Scientology beliefs and practices Predestination Education in Romania Free will Externality Ethics Marriage BDSM History of the United States (1918-1945) Customs and etiquette of Japan Monetary policy Status of religious freedom in Sudan Apprenticeship Landmark decision Barrister American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Anarcho-capitalism Economy of India Economic calculation problem Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Human rights in the United States Australian constitutional law

what kind of jobs can i get at with job permit i live in central cali if that helps and i'll be turning in a few months plus only a year of jr high left i'm hoping to get a job maybe as a bagger at a grocery store or work at a place like subway burger king all i really want is to not be as dependant on my parents for movie money friend birthday money ect that i will have to pay back with loads of chores later on thanks for any help here's a short list of jobs which you can create to generate income learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties birthday celebrations etc seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples a starter calligraphy kit usually runs around and anyone can easily pick up this skill the going rate is usually per hand addressed item become a poser who assists wedding photographers in setting and arranging various individuals in group and single photographic positions posers carry around a sketch book of various sitting and standing poses which consists of onion skin overlays of various wedding pictures bound in albums again contact local wedding photographers and wedding planners accordingly the hourly pay is around per hour and you are often invited to attend all dining activities seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting weed removal plant tree trimming light brush clearance you will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools again do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved a door to door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between to per hour offer policing removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process again a door to door solicitation of neighbors is in order you can charge between to per hour acquire a set of window cleaning tools a bucket liquid window cleaner sponge squeegee handle with an extension and a small step ladder and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services however be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story charge per window panel become a proxy stand in for neighbors to allow delivery of goods and packages to your home apartment acquire the authority to sign any receipt of incoming packages as an accepting neighbor charge per each package handled by you consider becoming a restaurant cafe customer liaison by using your cell phone at restaurants cafes to coordinate with the hostess to keep track of waiting customers whenever there's a very long period of time to activate a waiting list you want to offer the restaurant your services so that customers do not have to stand around for any lengthy period of time and when their name assigned number comes up you can call the upcoming customer's cell phone to tell them that they can return to the restaurant and be served the call back fee is usually around cents on a per head basis for example a couple would be charged while children under would not be charged placement of a plaque which outlines your fee schedule near the hostess station is sufficient to garner attention of prospective customers who will value your services since they can do other activities outside of the restaurant often beyond the range of any inhouse paging system you realize that everyone has a cellphone and why not take advantage of the connectivity to make the diner's experience worthwhile the restaurant will also appreciate the added service you are providing as a customer liaison why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing convalescent assisted living care centers and hospitals it involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves the starting rate is per hour the only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding a posting of your services by a business card or flyer on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers the paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time good luck  United States Postal Service Online Copyright Infringement

can you get a job at in sc that is all you need to know here's a short list of jobs which you can create to generate income learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties birthday celebrations etc seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples a starter calligraphy kit usually runs around and anyone can easily pick up this skill the going rate is usually per hand addressed item become a poser who assists wedding photographers in setting and arranging various individuals in group and single photographic positions posers carry around a sketch book of various sitting and standing poses which consists of onion skin overlays of various wedding pictures bound in albums again contact local wedding photographers and wedding planners accordingly the hourly pay is around per hour and you are often invited to attend all dining activities seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting weed removal plant tree trimming light brush clearance you will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools again do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved a door to door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between to per hour offer policing removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process again a door to door solicitation of neighbors is in order you can charge between to per hour acquire a set of window cleaning tools a bucket liquid window cleaner sponge squeegee handle with an extension and a small step ladder and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services however be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story charge per window panel become a proxy stand in for neighbors to allow delivery of goods and packages to your home apartment acquire the authority to sign any receipt of incoming packages as an accepting neighbor charge per each package handled by you consider becoming a restaurant cafe customer liaison by using your cell phone at restaurants cafes to coordinate with the hostess to keep track of waiting customers whenever there's a very long period of time to activate a waiting list you want to offer the restaurant your services so that customers do not have to stand around for any lengthy period of time and when their name assigned number comes up you can call the upcoming customer's cell phone to tell them that they can return to the restaurant and be served the call back fee is usually around cents on a per head basis for example a couple would be charged while children under would not be charged placement of a plaque which outlines your fee schedule near the hostess station is sufficient to garner attention of prospective customers who will value your services since they can do other activities outside of the restaurant often beyond the range of any inhouse paging system you realize that everyone has a cellphone and why not take advantage of the connectivity to make the diner's experience worthwhile the restaurant will also appreciate the added service you are providing as a customer liaison why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing convalescent assisted living care centers and hospitals it involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves the starting rate is per hour the only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding a posting of your services by a business card or flyer on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers the paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time good luck  Spam (electronic) United States

im and i want a job in ca ok im years old a girl i really want a job i have experience from school by helping alot of teachers and stuff but i live in california and i dont want to do stuff like babysitting im sordof tired of that im going to high school private school in august and i want a part time job can you guys give me some good websites here's a short list of part time jobs which you can create to generate income learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties birthday celebrations etc seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples a starter calligraphy kit usually runs around and anyone can easily pick up this skill the going rate is usually per hand addressed item become a poser who assists wedding photographers in setting and arranging various individuals in group and single photographic positions posers carry around a sketch book of various sitting and standing poses which consists of onion skin overlays of various wedding pictures bound in albums again contact local wedding photographers and wedding planners accordingly the hourly pay is around per hour and you are often invited to attend all dining activities seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting weed removal plant tree trimming light brush clearance you will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools again do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved a door to door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between to per hour offer policing removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process again a door to door solicitation of neighbors is in order you can charge between to per hour acquire a set of window cleaning tools a bucket liquid window cleaner sponge squeegee handle with an extension and a small step ladder and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services however be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story charge per window panel become a proxy stand in for neighbors to allow delivery of goods and packages to your home apartment acquire the authority to sign any receipt of incoming packages as an accepting neighbor charge per each package handled by you consider becoming a restaurant cafe customer liaison by using your cell phone at restaurants cafes to coordinate with the hostess to keep track of waiting customers whenever there's a very long period of time to activate a waiting list you want to offer the restaurant your services so that customers do not have to stand around for any lengthy period of time and when their name assigned number comes up you can call the upcoming customer's cell phone to tell them that they can return to the restaurant and be served the call back fee is usually around cents on a per head basis for example a couple would be charged while children under would not be charged placement of a plaque which outlines your fee schedule near the hostess station is sufficient to garner attention of prospective customers who will value your services since they can do other activities outside of the restaurant often beyond the range of any inhouse paging system you realize that everyone has a cellphone and why not take advantage of the connectivity to make the diner's experience worthwhile the restaurant will also appreciate the added service you are providing as a customer liaison why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing convalescent assisted living care centers and hospitals it involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves the starting rate is per hour the only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding a posting of your services by a business card or flyer on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers the paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time good luck  Spam (electronic) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Japanese tea ceremony Filling station Windows XP Air traffic control Cable

are my work boundaries too strict i work with people in their homes and i really like my job in the past i was exposed to really unhealthy home environments where parents and single adults have revealed tmi to the point where it was very personal and completely inappropriate to involve me looking back i've learned what are good boundaries nowadays whenever a person i work with asks me personal information i tell them a generic answer i get asked what i'm doing for the weekend and i just say oh laundry going to a movie errands and then i go back to talking about them or the activity on hand my supervisors have all told me i'm very professional but a few people have complained to them about how i seem mean and distant because i won't divulge details of my personal life but that isn't any of their business and also i probably won't be there for another year and would never see them again or meet outside of work are my boundaries too strict i've just learned to be work focused and professional well to certain questions like why aren't you married i laughed and said you're funny and then changed the subject then there are times where someone i work with in their home will ask me what i'm doing for the weekend and i'll say oh just cleaning but i see you've got your plate full with what else are you planning i always try to remain polite and courteous to the people i work with and to my coworkers but that doesn't mean it's their business to know other personal information which i've learned from the past was a mistake to share such as having a boyfriend my family sensitive issues and what my opinion is on them etc i once answered the do you have a bf question only to have a mother constantly ask me why i wasn't engaged yet and when she was my age she was already married and then another time when i told a person who i worked with in their home i'd be at a certain theater to watch a movie they went there and said they wanted to watch it with me no they arent its up to you what you reveal about your private life just as it is for them they need to suck it up  Friends Plame affair Humphrey Bogart Social rule EastEnders Avenue Q Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten Motion picture rating system Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 About a Boy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Scientology beliefs and practices Theory of conduct Sexual orientation Extreme Programming Have I Got News For You The Ashlee Simpson Show George Costanza Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Milton H.

abusive boss hi i work for a mortgage company which at the beggining i really enjoyed until my boss will start calling me after work asking me and pushing me to work after hours and call me many time and send me several text messages pushing me to do it he wont pay me extra hours we don't have a written contract he doesn't pay sick days or holidays i have no benefits like insurance last week i was sick at the hospital and he called me asking me things about work i'm in the process of looking for another job but might time weeks meanwhile i really need this job but i'm stressing out and it is really messing with my mental health i don't know what to do i even have to go to his house and pay his personal bills because he can't even write a check to pay his own please advise thank you what a lot of this stuff sounds really fishy and not to mention it's crossing all sorts of ethical boundaries it's unethical for him to ask you to work extra hours without pay not to mention it's really crossing boundaries for you to go to his house to pay his personal bills without having record of it somehow on payroll or something i really recommend finding a new job within the next week or two search on careerbuilder monster craigslist org and backpage com look in the newspaper and find something because this is getting out of hand in the meantime what needs to happen is to set clear and professional boundaries first tell him you won't go to his house to pay his bills because that's not work related or he needs to bring those items into the office during work hours for you to complete with pay secondly you also need to tell him that if he is asking you to work after hours you need to be paid at least half time or you will not do it thirdly report his a to the better business bureau don't tell him of course and notify them that the manager is abusing his authority and demanding that his employees work outside of work hours with no pay that'll get him in gear either that or broke from paying lawyer's fees but really this needs to stop he can try to continue to manipulate you using fear over you but start setting these boundaries  Wal-Mart Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Unemployment Insurance Social rule Advance fee fraud Payroll United States Postal Service London Congestion Charge Blackjack Life insurance Plame affair E-mail spam Outsourcing Video game developer Air traffic controller Search engine optimization Open access FairTax Royal Assent Sin City New Deal Scientology beliefs and practices Evan Mecham Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Call centre Extreme Programming Alex Ferguson Health care in the United States Childbirth Internet fraud Sweatshop Mortgage Poker jargon Ethics 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Construction Roswell UFO incident Theory of conduct Friends Education in the People's Republic of China 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines National Health Service The Amazing Race Social Security (United States) She Loves You RuneScape quests Time Out of Mind Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Employment in Hong Kong Management Ocean's Twelve Microeconomics Notary public Karl Rove Make money fast USA PATRIOT Act Transactional analysis Graduate school Swimming Electronic Arts Labor theory of value Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Minimum wage Publicly funded medicine Shaggy dog story Infantilism Firefighter Hey Jude Sampling (music) Drug test Triage Mensal__o scandal George Costanza Fair Game (Scientology) Annuity Theodore Kaczynski Blood (computer game) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Street-Legal Procrastination The Apprentice 2 Spam (electronic) Mental Health Act 1983 Primerica Financial Services Leeds United F.C. 2005 trial of Michael Jackson US health reform under FDR Medical prescription Kasparov versus The World Vivian Solon Divorce

i really need help please ok i'm quitting my job because i got written up about something and i feel like i never want to go there again i really support the company i work for but i couldn't stand being a detriment to them i wouldn't do anything to intentionally hurt that company i'm young now i don't know what to do because i wanted to be able to use them as a ref on a resume but i can't now and i wasted two years of my life i have no experience except customer service but know one will even kow that i don't want to go to school i just bought a new car it's not paid off so end of story i unintentionally ruined my entire life and i don't know how to fix it wonderful first don't sweat that you got written up it feels bad but that feeling will go away soon the best thing you could do is try to not do what you did to get written up second if you don't think this job is for you then start to look for another job when you're interviewing for another job if they ask why you're leaving your current job instead of saying that you don't like this job or that you can't perform it turn it into a positive experience by identifying what exactly you like about the new position of course the new potential employer may ask for references not just facts about where and when you worked at this current company but some positive references about your job is there someone at your current job you could use as a reference maybe a co worker who could vouch for you most importantly don't quit this job before you find another one while you're looking for a new job show your current employer that you could do a great job who knows maybe you could turn a negative into a positive your life isn't ruined everyone goes through difficult situations this may sound ironic but we need to go through difficult times in order to gain wisdom and maturity work is important find a job you enjoy and try to be the best at it  Unemployment Drug test Freeters Sweatshop One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule Friends Shaggy dog story Bon Jovi Knots Landing Procrastination Game programmer Carl Barks Transactional analysis Theory of conduct G-Man (Half-Life) The Apprentice 2 James T.

job interview i have a job interview for the new kohl's that is hiring located in my town i was just wondering if anyone has any advice for job interviews being that this is my first one and i am a bit nervous since it is a group interview oh and if you have any experience working at kohl's can you tell me what it is like working there any tips would be greatly appreciated by the way the job interview is minutes long first of all do a bit of research just go the the kohl's website to see who founded it and such and get some questions to ask even if you don't really want to know write them down or put them to memory to ask whether about the job or business this way it shows you have an interest in the company wear something casual and dressy something that says 'i will put effort to look nice but not so that it's distracting' don't wear anything revealing or short and nothing too fashionable stick with the basics mid cut skirt with a tasteful print and a solid blouse wear sensible but attractive shoes no stilletos sit straight up hands in lap and ankles crossed when asked a question look them directly in the eyes and answer honestly but not obviously be kind and watch your grammar as in don't say 'ain't' don't interrupt over the others and look at them as they speak this gives them an impression of being a people person you might be asked a series of questions so have answers ready why did you quit you quit your last job you didn't have a previous job so instead state the reason you are looking to work there if it's just because you need money or your parents are making you don't say that say instead that you are looking to pay for college this shows them that you set yourself financial goals and have an aim in life what hours are you available don't be afraid to be honest in this one if you a hundred percent flexible that's great but if you can't work wednesdays for whatever reason tell them that they understand that you have a life outside work what are good qualities about yourself here you'll be worried that saying one thing might make you seem boastful but not saying that might not sell you v well here's what you do when stating what you are good at state that 'you've been told' that or 'you've gotten awards' or 'you feel you are proficient' for example say you are good with people state 'i've been told that i'm friendly and easy to get along with ' it's always smart to say when applying for any position that deals with customer service that you enjoy helping people be careful not to sound robotic when saying it though try telling a made up if needed story about how you went to some place and a cashier or worker person helped you in a surprisingly fantastic way and add that you'd like to do that for people works every time also if you were in any clubs in school state that because clubs socialisation what are your bad qualities you have bad qualities maybe you don't like getting up early but try telling the ones that are less bad such as 'i'm clumsy' good luck  Social rule Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story The Apprentice 2 Milton H.

should i continue working with this client i do direct in home care with people who have mental illnesses and for the most part i really like my job however there was one client who decided that she had enough and felt she was being bossed around partly due to her illness' symptoms but at the same time she made a lot of choices knowing fully aware the consequences such as kicking me out several times and refusing to follow her care plan i'm a little hesitant to tell my superior that i am apprehensive about working with her again esp during the school year not to mention i cannot afford to drive mns only to waste my time along with valuable county money funds are used to pay for these services on one hand i don't want to seem like i'm copping out but at the same time in the past i can remember not speaking up and dreading every work day i have more control of my work at this company what should i do should i continue but give this client one last chance and then i'm done or should i discontinue i also wanted to add this client is an adult and is fully aware that she can request changes to her care plan so it's more fulfilling for her to follow it and complete the goals however whenever such changes are made there are many times where she still refuses she has also used manipulation to get what she wants but i have been rather strict in holding my ground which angers her my superior talked to her and said the client wasn't angry with me i've just learned from the past not to waver from rules and policies and to also keep my boundaries this client really dislikes that a friend told me to continue working with this client but have a plan on how to make things easier for both of us and if she kicks me out again make that the last time i work with her i also don't want to wreck my good standing with the company my last review was excellent that's why i'm a little hesitant but i don't want to end up dreading work or feeling powerless like my other jobs i have spoken to my superior about this on a few occasions and have always been very thorough and honest about what happened and what i did each time a couple superiors know i have always been told that i handled the situation correctly these situations have involved the client getting mad at me because i refused to break policy there was one time i asked her to reschedule an activity at a time other than her direct care time which is expected of all clients and there have been times where i told her i will not just waste time getting lost in my car and we need to start planning ahead each time i have always been clear and polite i've only been working with her for nearly months she also has a history of being resistant and trying to break policy my superiors know that what i'm concerned about is how this will reflect about me i want to be consistent and fair but goodness knows i've been in situations where i hated each minute and i felt like i had no control to the last poster whoever said that the client wasn't being treated with respect i also work with a similar population as well and even though a lot of these people have mental health issues they are still adults and many of them are aware of what they are doing i would tread carefully on this decision weigh all the pros and cons it seems like you have really put a lot of time into this client sometimes no matter what you do some people will never change and this client's habit of always refusing to do what she needs to do is manipulative and no she isn't your only means of a paycheck there are other jobs out there talk to your supervisor about this and go from there  Theory of conduct Social rule Knots Landing Pitaten Traumatic incident reduction EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Milton H.

credit checks for employment why do companies do credit checks for employment i was thinking if you are out of a job it is likely your credit score will drop because of lack of income so how can you pay your bills without an income you need a job companies generally want to do a credit check if the employee will be in a position to handle cash or credit cards because the temptation to take some would be greater i am a former human resource manager if someone told me they were going to do a credit check for a job that did not entail money or credit checks i would ask them why if they said something like to find out how responsible you are i would ask them if they could validate the results of the test to show that people with poor credit ratings were not as responsible as others there are many reasons for a poor credit rating and they do not all have to do with irresponsibility i would feel that the test could be discriminatory even though i have great credit i would not want to work for a company that required this report incidently credit reports do not indicate how much money you have they just tell whether you pay your bills in a timely manner and show how many credit cards you have and indicate if you have been declined for credit  Credit card The Amazing Race Taxation in the United States Insurance Inflation Corporate finance Slot machine Labour economics Graduate school Bank United Kingdom corporation tax Internet fraud Drug test Flat tax Affirmative action Intelligence quotient Education in the People's Republic of China Unemployment benefit Poker jargon Credit score Debit card Minimum wage Primerica Financial Services Cheque Capitalism Electronic commerce Money supply Life insurance Credit union Social Security (United States) 401(k) Unemployment Economy of Russia Personal finance Dividend Fiat money Food Stamp Program Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Finance HIV test Economic inequality Ford Motor Company FairTax Octopus card Anarchist economics Money Monetary policy Yield curve U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Wal-Mart Termination of employment Deflation (economics) Bond Annuity Public Eye Bretton Woods system Call centre British national identity card Predatory lending Hyperinflation Tax Year 2000 problem Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Electricity meter National Kidney Foundation Singapore Background check Medicare (Canada) United States Postal Service Incident Command System Great Depression Credit history Publicly funded medicine John Lott Identity theft Debugging Betting (poker) Student loan Surveillance Gun politics Child support Israeli Arab Tom DeLay Freeters Citigroup Mike Harris GED Economy of Haiti Compensation of employees Charles Ponzi Monetarism Skype National Insurance Mortgage Outsourcing 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities AIDS in Africa Polytomous Rasch model Financial audit Electronic money Reaganomics

what can i do i have been a stay at home mom for yrs no serious job experience i want to do something during the day while kids are at school i volunteer but i kinda want a job i was going back to school but at the last minute didn't qualify for financial aid due to living in military housing didn't relize they counted that what kind of things can i do i really don't want to work in fast food i really wanted to go to school but without the fincial aid i really can't afford it by aug th as that would be about to come up with in days maybe i will re look that option in a few mths i think about our security very often and realize i need to work to draw social security when older just not sure how to get started thanks for the advice you said you were thinking about school but at the last minute didn't qualify for financial aid not qualifying for financial aid should not be an obstacle if education is what you want to pursue community colleges are a wonderful thing that i strongly believe in for many reasons first their tuition is low second they offer classes at more flexible hours than four year universities online nights and saturday mornings finally they typically offer interesting certificates that you wouldn't find elsewhere such as culinary arts audio visual technology sign language communication and landscaping was keeping yourself busy during the day your only reason for considering education stop and think about this where do you see yourself in five years do you want your own money would you like to have the security of knowing that if something happened to your husband you would have the income to support your children do you want the personal satisfaction of a career remember just wanting something to do during the day while the kids are at school is fine but consider if you want something more every mother's delight is her children but beyond that what are your passions consider this then plan your next steps best of luck to you in finding a wonderful adventure  Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Germany Graduate school Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Education in the United States Tuition Avenue Q 2005 trial of Michael Jackson One Tree Hill (TV series) Jon Secada Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Community college Education in Hong Kong Time Out of Mind Life insurance Humphrey Bogart Cindy Sheehan Chinese University of Hong Kong Rosa Parks College admissions PLATO Social rule Hey Jude The Family from One End Street Satchel Paige Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pitaten Plame affair Far Eastern University Unemployment W.

i need to get a full time job i have been a stay at home mom for years and now am ready to have a full time job i miss having money to buy my kids things i am divorced and in my second marriage and are living check to check i enjoy staying home taking care of my kids but while they are at school i feel like i could be making some money but then once i get a job they get sick or other things come up where i have to miss work and i end up quitting before getting fired how will i know when i'm ready to start working again i realize it is a general question so those of you with smart ass answers can just keep them to yourselves i am i a real delima here hopefully you have a number of female friends mothers working friends start asking about possible job opportunities or if they know of any places hiring you are ready to start working but what i would suggest is a flexible job career that allows you to work around your children school etc even if you started out working one or two days a week or or hours a day this would allow you to be available for emergencies dr appts and all the other things that require your time you might also consider starting a small business out of your home be sure it is something you truly enjoy though this to would allow you the freedom needed since you can basically set your own hours hopefully this will help you or at least get you thinking about being able to balance home kids and a job don't rush into a full time job or career they can be very demanding and you will be forced to choose between your children and work instead ease into it gradually until you know the children can take care of themselves or at least not require you to miss work to sit home and take care of them good luck single parent who faced the same problem  Friends Unemployment Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) Shaggy dog story The Fairly OddParents Alcoholics Anonymous EastEnders The Amazing Race Saved by the Bell Economics The Adventures of Pete & Pete The Critic Breastfeeding Freeters Social rule New York Giants Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Care Bears Poker jargon Betting (poker) Laura Schlessinger Labour economics $ale of the Century Pitaten The Amber Spyglass Knots Landing Mach kernel Kodocha T'Pol Keynesian economics Good Times Public Eye Extreme Programming Eric Bischoff Ben Johnson (athlete) Divorce Kevin and Kell Shit Money supply Health insurance World Championship Wrestling Escape from New York Charmed San Francisco 49ers The Human Stain Mother Teresa President (game) Fancy Crane New York Jets Labor theory of value Adoption Sharon Stone Jon Secada Alexander Technique The Ashlee Simpson Show Anarchism and society 2000 Australian Grand Prix Athrun Zala Culture of the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Infantilism Scientology beliefs and practices Blonde on Blonde Kurt Cobain Married... with Children Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Economic inequality Polyamory Rich Mullins The O.C.

people say follow your heart in careers but what if your heart tells you to do about ten different things for those of us who don't have one all encompassing life passion choosing a satisfying career is near impossible one day it's one thing the next day it's something else the next day it's another field the next day it's another career then it usually gets back around to the beginning and it starts all over again talk about frustrating any advice for those of us who have a million different interests and who find choosing the right career almost impossible i don't want to be one of those people who is years old realizing they just spent the majority of their life doing something they hate thanks i would challenge you to think of even one truly successful person who isn't constantly juggling at least things maybe a hundred things all at the same time so its certainly not a bad thing to be multi talented and able to multi task of course there are also realities in life like keeping a roof over your head clothes on your back and food on your table most of us start with a job to supply the necessities of life but your job isn't your life do the job but then use the rest of your daily life pursuing other things that interest you the more interests you pursue the more experience and knowledge and contacts you will gain you never know when that cumulative knowledge experience and contacts will lead you to a more interesting career and a more interesting life to be sure the key perhaps is to tackle those various interests as you are realistically able and not bite off more than you can competently chew good luck  Social rule Theory of conduct One Tree Hill (TV series) Kender W.I.T.C.H.

have a good guess at this second interview ok at a gym where they hire more than one person for a front desk position about how many people do you think they would narrow it down to for a second interview at my first interview there were about people he interviewed and today called me for a second interview and i was just wondering about how many people they probly narrowed it down to as a guess thanks it depends on the interview process if the gym will make a determination of whom to hire after the second round of interviews they have probably narrowed it down to two or three candidates if there is going to be a third round the ten to fifteen people in the first round was probably cut in half just go in and act like this is your last chance either way it is you will either move on get the job or no longer be considered sell yourself and the result should work out for you  Social rule Job interview Internal ballistics The Contender (television series) Diamond cut IP (complexity) Vowel Springfield Elementary School Norway national football team Instant-runoff voting Public domain Graduate school Password cracking Labor theory of value The Apprentice 2 candidates $ale of the Century Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2005 Time Out of Mind Wheel of Fortune Equine conformation Family Feud Stopping power Secretary desk Mixed martial arts Password Species Cribbage Dominoes Wood carving Economic inequality Lighting Winning Streak Age of Wonders Sphenoid bone Single Transferable Vote Radar WKYC-TV New York Giants Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Illusion of control Dartmouth College Password (game) Whose Line Is It Anyway?

where can a year old work in washington i would like to avoid mcdonalds here's a short list of jobs which you can create to generate income learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties birthday celebrations etc seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples a starter calligraphy kit usually runs around and anyone can easily pick up this skill the going rate is usually per hand addressed item become a poser who assists wedding photographers in setting and arranging various individuals in group and single photographic positions posers carry around a sketch book of various sitting and standing poses which consists of onion skin overlays of various wedding pictures bound in albums again contact local wedding photographers and wedding planners accordingly the hourly pay is around per hour and you are often invited to attend all dining activities seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting weed removal plant tree trimming light brush clearance you will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools again do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved a door to door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between to per hour offer policing removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process again a door to door solicitation of neighbors is in order you can charge between to per hour acquire a set of window cleaning tools a bucket liquid window cleaner sponge squeegee handle with an extension and a small step ladder and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services however be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story charge per window panel become a proxy stand in for neighbors to allow delivery of goods and packages to your home apartment acquire the authority to sign any receipt of incoming packages as an accepting neighbor charge per each package handled by you consider becoming a restaurant cafe customer liaison by using your cell phone at restaurants cafes to coordinate with the hostess to keep track of waiting customers whenever there's a very long period of time to activate a waiting list you want to offer the restaurant your services so that customers do not have to stand around for any lengthy period of time and when their name assigned number comes up you can call the upcoming customer's cell phone to tell them that they can return to the restaurant and be served the call back fee is usually around cents on a per head basis for example a couple would be charged while children under would not be charged placement of a plaque which outlines your fee schedule near the hostess station is sufficient to garner attention of prospective customers who will value your services since they can do other activities outside of the restaurant often beyond the range of any inhouse paging system you realize that everyone has a cellphone and why not take advantage of the connectivity to make the diner's experience worthwhile the restaurant will also appreciate the added service you are providing as a customer liaison why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing convalescent assisted living care centers and hospitals it involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves the starting rate is per hour the only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding a posting of your services by a business card or flyer on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers the paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time good luck  Online Copyright

how can i find more jobs to apply to i live in michigan and we have the highest unemployment rate and the least amount of jobs i log onto careerbuilder monster and hot jobs daily i also have pulled lists off of hoover's forbes etc to use as a guide i then apply via the company website i have received calls and a few interviews but the competition is stiff the feedback i am getting is that available positions with my expertise and qualifications the recruiters are receiving between resumes minimum how can i make myself stand out my resume and cover letter are good and i think my interview skills are pretty good too i just haven't had enough open positions to apply to and therefore close the deal it's so frustrating are there any other job boards out there or is there something else i should be doing i feel like it is really a numbers gain the more positions i apply for the better my chances any ideas i am getting so frustrated i have also tried craig's list but they don't seem to have too many professional careers on there right now i am lucky if i can find two positions to apply to per day and apparently so are others applying to the same job yes i have posted on monster careerbuilder and hot jobs i get a lot of recruiters and work from home opportunities i removed them from the board think about it logically if there aren't enough jobs and too many people unemployed employers here don't need to go looking for applicants applicants need to look for them one of the key points that i always taught during job training classes is networking and cold calling networking basically is using the relationships that you have and using them to learn of new and potential leads the vast majority of jobs are not obtained through resumes or applications but through word of mouth the best way to network is to advertise that you are job seeking and sell yourself for more tips http www quintcareers com networking guide html http www quintcareers com networking html also try cold calling companys and set up an informational interview this way you can get your foot in the door it may not lead you to a job but it can lead you in the direction of a potential job remember everyone knows everyone in certain industries http www handbag com careers careerchange coldcall http www careerlinkbc com interview html http www nzherald co nz section story cfm c id objectid  World Wide Web Unemployment Minimum wage HyperText Transfer Protocol Apple Computer Strategic management Economic inequality Cross site scripting Baseball Website Uniform Resource Locator Gmail Common Unix Printing System Education in the People's Republic of China Software engineering Search engine optimization Network effect Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Domain Name System Plame affair LiveJournal Labour economics Poker jargon Education in the United States Computer Unemployment benefit Graduate school Advertising Spice Girls E-mail spam HTML Education in Portugal The Colbert Report UK Singles Chart Theory of conduct R__sum__ Electronic commerce Enterprise content management Expert system JavaServer Pages Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Wget Economy of Colombia Representational State Transfer America Online Capitalism Google Ajax (programming) RuneScape Spam (electronic) Artificial neural network Barrister Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Walt Disney World College Program Inflation Diving Internet fraud Social rule HTTP cookie Dog agility The Apprentice 2 Neopets Operational amplifier Insurance Ra (board game) Wireless Application Protocol Backgammon Tariff Transmission Control Protocol Web traffic Call centre Psychology Wi-Fi HTML element Jeff Gannon Anarchism and society Database Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Quotation mark Computer virus Web server Warren Buffett Milton H.

employment verification i was hired by a company months ago however the position was misrepresented to me and i don't want to waste anymore time there so now i am looking for another job i've told potential employers that my current employer does not know i am looking so please do not contact them would most employers respect that and not contact them for employment verification considering that i am still there and don't want to get fired if they received a phone call i have excellent references from previous employers couldn't i just give those references most employers are upfront and ask if you give them permission to contact their current employer if you say no they will respect that but at the same time they may question why and that may lead to your integrity as a potential employee you're best bet is to be honest and let potential employers know that you are job hunting because you don't feel that the job you are in right now and if they would respect your decision and not contact your current employer since it will cause conflict on the job that should cover al your bases and make you look good but be aware that mistakes do happen  Plame affair Social rule Poker jargon 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Sydney Riot of 1879 The Apprentice 2 Unemployment Electronic Arts Indian English Craps New York Jets Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Transactional analysis Short selling Time Out of Mind Florida Central Voter File Evan Mecham Theory of conduct Wal-Mart One Tree Hill (TV series) American football strategy Call centre Corporate governance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Ashlee Simpson Show Baseball Insurance Customer relationship management Mach kernel The Amazing Race Current teachings of Prem Rawat Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Consensus decision-making Employment Therion (band) Yoga Sutras of Patanjali United Airlines Flight 93 GSM services Surveillance Inflation Employment agency Anderson Cooper Steve Jobs Illegal immigration Job interview Shaggy dog story Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Karl Rove Volleyball Yusuf al-Qaradawi Emotions (album) Rain Man G-Man (Half-Life) Credit card Advance fee fraud Ethics New York Giants Killian documents Project Blue Book Ocean's Twelve Ross Perot Abortion debate Non-native pronunciations of English Plame affair timeline Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Trading Places Keynesian economics Parliament Act The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Betting (poker) Drug test Love and Theft Outsourcing Solar cell Michael D.

too young but want a job i am cant drive myself around and i really want a job does anyone know of maybe an online business where i could make some money here's a short list of jobs which you can create to generate income learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties birthday celebrations etc seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples a starter calligraphy kit usually runs around and anyone can easily pick up this skill the going rate is usually per hand addressed item become a poser who assists wedding photographers in setting and arranging various individuals in group and single photographic positions posers carry around a sketch book of various sitting and standing poses which consists of onion skin overlays of various wedding pictures bound in albums again contact local wedding photographers and wedding planners accordingly the hourly pay is around per hour and you are often invited to attend all dining activities seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting weed removal plant tree trimming light brush clearance you will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools again do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved a door to door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between to per hour offer policing removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process again a door to door solicitation of neighbors is in order you can charge between to per hour acquire a set of window cleaning tools a bucket liquid window cleaner sponge squeegee handle with an extension and a small step ladder and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services however be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story charge per window panel become a proxy stand in for neighbors to allow delivery of goods and packages to your home apartment acquire the authority to sign any receipt of incoming packages as an accepting neighbor charge per each package handled by you consider becoming a restaurant cafe customer liaison by using your cell phone at restaurants cafes to coordinate with the hostess to keep track of waiting customers whenever there's a very long period of time to activate a waiting list you want to offer the restaurant your services so that customers do not have to stand around for any lengthy period of time and when their name assigned number comes up you can call the upcoming customer's cell phone to tell them that they can return to the restaurant and be served the call back fee is usually around cents on a per head basis for example a couple would be charged while children under would not be charged placement of a plaque which outlines your fee schedule near the hostess station is sufficient to garner attention of prospective customers who will value your services since they can do other activities outside of the restaurant often beyond the range of any inhouse paging system you realize that everyone has a cellphone and why not take advantage of the connectivity to make the diner's experience worthwhile the restaurant will also appreciate the added service you are providing as a customer liaison why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing convalescent assisted living care centers and hospitals it involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves the starting rate is per hour the only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding a posting of your services by a business card or flyer on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers the paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time good luck  United States Postal Service Spam (electronic) Japanese tea ceremony Windows XP Air traffic control Gmail Cable television Filling station E-mail

i have a group interview at kohl's help please my interview is tomorrow and i'm so nervous what exactly is a group interview at kohl's some say it's numerous candidates being interviewed at the same time others say a group interview will be several key staff members just interviewing me anyone which one kohl's is i'm so nervous if several of us are being interviewed at the same time will the person single me out and ask me specific questions from my application and resume for example i have some gaps in employment will the the person say so james tell me about these gaps in employment you have okay i'm gonna try to calm down and take a breather now if someone could help me i'd greatly appreciate it though in retail a group interview that is not a management position is a few candidates being interviewed at once normally this is done when the store is looking for a large amount of people to fill positions ie christmas new store opening the positions they are looking to fill are usually on the floor customer service type of jobs nothing with any responsibility they will ask you general questions that the whole group will answer or just a few people and then the next few people will be asked a different question depending on the interviewer best thing to keep in mind is you want to stand out from the crowd don't give the same answer everyone else did relax normally group interviews are less painful the one on one interviews because they are looking to screen out the crazies before they move on the next group or round of interviews you will be fine good luck  Social rule The Apprentice 2 Expert system Interview Sharon Tate Coming of Age (TNG episode) Job interview The Ashlee Simpson Show Retailer Probation officer Single Transferable Vote George W.

what skills do you need to work in a print shop i am in graphic design and looking for part time work around my neighborhood there is a print shope nearby that i would love to work for but i really am not sure what the job would entail anyone know i need as much detail as possible in your answers since you mentioned graphic design i'm guessing that you would be interested in a prepress aka typesetting position with the print shop modern typesetting primarily uses computers either pc or mac and in ways resembles other design disciplines graphic web the tools of the trade are often quark and adobe products what tends to be very different about prepress work is the limited use of your artistic creativity there definitely will be a few jobs that you get to design and create for clients but the vast majority of work coming into a shop has already been laid out by the client it arrives on a disk and your job is to setup the pagination for the particular press it is slated to run on will it run up up up what size paper coated or uncoated color is another issue that falls on a prepress tech unlike computers which use rgb printing uses cmyk colors must be separated especially for use on offset presses from there you print the file to a piece of film using a special printer which is passed along to someone called a stripper the stripper uses the film to make plates out of your separate sheets of film cyan magenta yellow black in some shops they have direct to plate printing eliminating the film stripping stage most jobs run one or two color one or two plates usually setup for individual pantone colors or four color four plates there are plenty of variations you can start getting very involved with multi color presses that can run or more different colors these usually end up running process cmyk colors a series of pantone colors and a protective coating therefore you should expect working in prepress to be a challenging position however you will be required to use your noggin for problem solving more often than design hope that helps  CMYK color model Color printing Color space Adobe Photoshop Gamut Graphic design Color Apple Macintosh Computer PostScript RGB color model Publishing Printing press Color theory Common Unix Printing System Ebook Markup language Adobe Systems Newspaper Traditional animation Mac OS X Digital photography 2D computer graphics Typesetting GIMP Photography Windows Vista Adobe Acrobat Pantone Atari 8-bit family Mach kernel Printed circuit board Apple typography Typewriter TeX Software engineering Linux PNG Computer virus Desktop publishing Stereoscopy Kernel (computer science) CPU cache System/36 Pixel System/34 AmigaOS Agfa-Gevaert Subtractive color Password Photographic film Compiler optimization Welding Computer printer Industrial engineering Screenshot Novell NetWare Dot matrix printer Technology Web design Primary color Casting Windows Server 2003 Stage lighting Printmaking Atari ST BASIC programming language Server Grid computing Konica Minolta Compact disc Trademark Mail art CPU design NeXT Yearbook Hard disk Enterprise content management Academic publishing ZX Spectrum Offset printing Enlarger Xerox Copyright Inheritance (computer science) Color management Commodore 64 Game programmer

good job for a year old here's a short list of jobs which you can create to generate income learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties birthday celebrations etc seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples a starter calligraphy kit usually runs around and anyone can easily pick up this skill the going rate is usually per hand addressed item become a poser who assists wedding photographers in setting and arranging various individuals in group and single photographic positions posers carry around a sketch book of various sitting and standing poses which consists of onion skin overlays of various wedding pictures bound in albums again contact local wedding photographers and wedding planners accordingly the hourly pay is around per hour and you are often invited to attend all dining activities seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting weed removal plant tree trimming light brush clearance you will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools again do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved a door to door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between to per hour offer policing removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process again a door to door solicitation of neighbors is in order you can charge between to per hour acquire a set of window cleaning tools a bucket liquid window cleaner sponge squeegee handle with an extension and a small step ladder and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services however be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story charge per window panel become a proxy stand in for neighbors to allow delivery of goods and packages to your home apartment acquire the authority to sign any receipt of incoming packages as an accepting neighbor charge per each package handled by you consider becoming a restaurant cafe customer liaison by using your cell phone at restaurants cafes to coordinate with the hostess to keep track of waiting customers whenever there's a very long period of time to activate a waiting list you want to offer the restaurant your services so that customers do not have to stand around for any lengthy period of time and when their name assigned number comes up you can call the upcoming customer's cell phone to tell them that they can return to the restaurant and be served the call back fee is usually around cents on a per head basis for example a couple would be charged while children under would not be charged placement of a plaque which outlines your fee schedule near the hostess station is sufficient to garner attention of prospective customers who will value your services since they can do other activities outside of the restaurant often beyond the range of any inhouse paging system you realize that everyone has a cellphone and why not take advantage of the connectivity to make the diner's experience worthwhile the restaurant will also appreciate the added service you are providing as a customer liaison why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing convalescent assisted living care centers and hospitals it involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves the starting rate is per hour the only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding a posting of your services by a business card or flyer on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers the paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time good luck  Spam (electronic) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act United States

is career councelling helpful or simply waste of time pls help me good question it depends on who is doing the career counseling if it is through a college or high school the counselors have been trained in all the theories relating to adult development and all of the theories relating to different types of career counseling they should also belong to several professional development groups that link with employers to study trends and issues however many of the freelance career counselors are simply people who are not good enough to land jobs in colleges because they are not very qualified these folk then open up their own business and charge quit a lot they also usually can not afford to stay very current as they have to pay for all of their own professional development you may not get a lot from them i am a college career counselor and we just hired for a position in our office we had very qualified applicants to choose among we also had about less qualified applicants everyone always thinks they would be good at counseling because they want to give people advice most people are not and we really do not tell people what they should do we help people assess themselves and explore options there is very little of my personal opinion in my counseling therefore like any counseling you get out of it what you put into it you can tell you are working with a good career counselor if they meet with you counsel you and then send you on your way to update your own resume and apply to positions yourself if they are doing it for you they are more of a placement official or headhunter these people are usually not qualified counselors if that is the type of service you are seeking those are the people you should hire if you want to explore your career options look at transferable skills and figure out what is the right niche for you then consult a career counselor i will add that i have been doing this for eight years and i am much better now than i was my first year i would ask how long the counselor has been practicing good luck  Psychotherapy School counselor Psychoanalysis Paralegal Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Deprogramming Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China Philosophical counseling Exit counseling College admissions Lawyer Psychology Life insurance Appeal Education in Romania Unemployment Education in the United States Affirmative action Public domain Transsexuality Plame affair Freeters Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Economics Career United Kingdom corporation tax Scientology beliefs and practices Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Community college Division of labour Insurance Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Ethics Barrister Rick Ross Adult attention-deficit disorder Software engineering Call centre Pretty Good Privacy Social work Cooperative education Physician Town meeting Trademark Labor theory of value Priesthood (Mormonism) Norway national football team Workplace democracy Management Extreme Programming GED Law school Genetic counseling Notary public Conscription Education Consensus decision-making Microsoft Associate's degree Juris Doctor Self-concept Bentley College Air traffic controller Taxation in the United States Immigration to the United States Mediation Expert system ISO 9000 Osteopathy Neuro-linguistic programming George W.

why would employer's put job applications on line it's too time consuming and it's quicker to just fill out paper applications it's like when i fill out on line job applications i'm always told they don't have a position for me at this time when they clearly have it posted that they're hiring for that particular position the theory is the online app's are easier to distribute to prospective employers and save time in reviewing they often lead however to a much less personal review and can be more easily ignored i suggest a phone call or personal email to a particular person referencing your online application then you can get the best of both worlds the automated response system becomes your only interface if you don't try to augment it with a personal touch good luck  Customer relationship management E-mail Plame affair IPod Enterprise content management Blog Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Expert system Craps Surveillance Private branch exchange Password Global Positioning System Ajax (programming) Linux IBM PC compatible Software engineering Morse Code Game programmer America Online Internet fraud Computer-supported collaboration Killian documents NeXT Apple Macintosh Voice over IP Outsourcing Internet forum Musical Instrument Digital Interface Computer Microsoft Mac OS history Social software Xerox Star Windows XP Call centre Electronic voting Opera (web browser) BitTorrent Florida Central Voter File Social network Workplace democracy Academia Mach kernel Unemployment benefit Embedded system Mac OS X Inflation MDAC Mac OS X v10.4 Gmail Computer virus DBASE Mouse (computing) Common criticisms of Microsoft Air traffic controller EGovernment Stopping e-mail abuse Chromatography Spam (electronic) Whois Michael D.

how should i ask for the day off help im currently working for a temp job and note that this friday is my last day i have a job interview for a very promising job this wednesday i originally was just going to call in sick that day but when i came in to work this morning i realized i left the details of my interview on my desk how should i tell my current job that i need wednesday off help honesty is generally your best bet everyone has been on the job hunt before and your supervisor is likely to sympathize you also probably don't need the entire day off see if you can work out an alternative schedule that allows you time for your interview but also ensures that no one at your current job is left in the lurch ultimately though the temp job is wrapping up and you're going to need to be able to eat in the coming weeks don't burn bridges if you can avoid it but do what you need to do to make the interview  Fasting Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Ocean's Twelve Paul Is Dead Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Hurricane Katrina timeline Wednesday Good Friday STS-59 Lent Operation Market Garden MTV2 Call centre The Addams Family BBC television drama Liturgical year Monday Night Football Dominical letter Air America Radio Jayson Blair Draw poker Battle of Gettysburg Cindy Sheehan Betting (poker) Mordechai Vanunu WNNX (FM) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Shaggy dog story Little Shop of Horrors Sharon Tate Dan Rather Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Saturday Night Live Compiler optimization Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Rosa Parks Occupation of Iraq timeline USS Vestal (AR-4) Air traffic controller Battles of Lexington and Concord DragonFly BSD Who Shot Mr. Burns?

last question re intervieing while pregnant i got the interview it's tomorrow at so i'm little bit beside myself in excitement i'm also months pregnant weeks to be exact i've done a little research and i believe that since i volunteer the fact that i'm pregnant an month belly really can't be hidden i'm walking in with my head held high knowing that i'm going to be perfect for that job i've decided that i'm going to basically say the following maybe not so rehearsed i'm excited to be working for organization and i look forward to a long tenure here i wanted to tell you upfront that i'm due to have a baby via c section on sept it is my plan to work here until sept so that i can document duties and work out the details of my return i do not plan on taking more than weeks of leave but i am also very flexible i realize that what you want to know is it i will be a committeed employee and i assure you that i will be any advice you can give me how does that sound okay i'm also planning to mention that i am not a person who likes to be idle and plan on taking work home with me during the time i am not physically able to travel to and from work i know the odds are stacked against me but i hope that my previous experience with them and the sample projects they had me create and turn in will be enough to wow them i should clarify things though i thank you all i've been an intern for this small nonprofit before the person interviewing is also my mentor and knows my history i gave birth to my son during my second to last semester took off weeks due to a hospital stay and still finished hours with a i also graduated cum laude with distinction as for the c section it's scheduled for around weeks so the chances of working up until then are quite posible the most important thing to remember when you are being intreviewed is that the person who is asking questions is an expert regardless whether he is or he is not you must assume he is and that any slight negative attitude that you may display will generate a motive for the interviewer to reject your application considering your pregnancy stuation and how it could affect your job performance now and after the baby is born i think the choice of the words you want to use is adequate however when you say those words make sure you are saying them with total self confidence and reliability the less you say the better as long as you can impress your interviewer that you are reliable and trustworthy i am sure a positive attitude will generate such an environement  Friends Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Breastfeeding EastEnders Sharon Tate Abortion debate Expert system Professor Childbirth Reliability engineering One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule Pregnancy Killian documents Extreme Programming Hospitality service Infantilism Time Out of Mind Knots Landing She Loves You G-Man (Half-Life) Ethics Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Second language acquisition International League Birth control Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Scientific method Prenatal diagnosis Education in the People's Republic of China Franz Boas Doomsday argument Scientology beliefs and practices New York Giants Software engineering Poker jargon Rosa Parks Intelligent design A Course In Miracles Bayesian inference Plame affair Stroke Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Abortion Probability Premature birth Guinea pig CPU cache Aerial (dance move) Apple Computer Autism Melanie Wilkes Child sexuality Big Brother UK series 6 Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 7 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sex Pistols The Emancipation of Mimi Jon Secada Acts of the Apostles Oral sex Days of our Lives Neighbours CPU design Urinary incontinence History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Australian constitutional law Species Abortion in the United States Incarnations of Immortality Roe v.

what is the best place for a new grad to look for a job what are some good strategies for getting a job names of good websites listen i am a recent college graduate don't listen to these people who are just passively telling you to go to careerbuilder com or monster com they tell you to submit your resume into a blackhole and act like everything will turn out fine it's a war out there and in war you must resort to aggressive tactics i've noticed that the internet is a good place to start with a job search but not necessarily a good place to finish people still seem to respond faster to paper applications than ones submitted online i understand some jobs don't accept paper applications i'm just saying there is still something special about that extra effort to try to meet with a breathing person then they remember you it is also better to conduct your own specialized job search instead of using a massive database such as monster or career builder you should compile a list of the companies you would like to work for and then go to their individual website and see if they are hiring contrary to popular belief no all employers don't post their career opportunities on monster or careerbuilder do anything to stay out of the mainstream even craigslist org may be helpful to search for local employment just do whatever you can to stand out above the thousands of graduates who are out there competing against us when interviewing if you have related job experience emphasize your maturity and work experiences rather than your college experiences most employers just see education as a basic requirement but not as an end all way to decide if you possess the skills necessary for a specific job to them education is just a box that they check off the long list of things that they expect from you some employers are also reluctant to hire new graduates because they see them as unstable volatile or immature i recently registered for several staffing agencies that was one of the smartest moves that i made initially i was against the idea because i was against temporary employment i discovered it's not as bad as i thought it's a good way to get into prestigious companies on a trial basis then you can gain not only skills and experiences but also the respect of the company after accessing your performance they may decide to take you on permanently lastly a good outlet for me is federal government employment you should go to usajobs com and search for jobs the advantage is the government has great entry level opportunities in almost every field imaginable that include training you would be looking for a gs or entry level job the disadvantage is the application process is very different than it is for private sector jobs and can take up to months to be considered for a position happy job hunting  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Software engineering Graduate school Affirmative action Education in Portugal Education in the People's Republic of China Paralegal Economic inequality Unemployment Intelligent design Education in Australia GED Milton H.

a question about job interviews does anyone know why this happens why don't companies send a letter or email to the people they have interviewed to let them know that the job has been filled it is very stressful to wait for two or three weeks and hear nothing back from the companies i send a letter of thanks after each interview but the companies don't seem to have the courtesy to inform me when the position is filled i email them one week later to let them know i am still interested yet they don't even respond to the email with a note saying if the job is filled or not i have heard this same thing from other people who go to interviews is it the new practice of hr to just ignore the people after the interview why would they think this is acceptable to job candidates is there anything i can do or say at the interview to encourage them to let me know don't take it personally yes it is the new practice somewhere along the line we as a culture decided people don't matter that much and therefore neither does politeness once you've decided someone isn't of use it takes a little time and energy so only exceptional people take that step these days i think you can ask the interviewer if it is their policy to let a candidate know when the position is filled and if it isn't their policy to do so then what would be a good time to check back with them it can be a good way to keep you in the mind of the interviewer i actually got a good job this way once my boss told me it was one of the reasons she hired me best of luck to you  Social rule Plame affair E-mail Internet fraud Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act The Apprentice 2 Advance fee fraud Karl Rove Coming of Age (TNG episode) Infantilism Scientology beliefs and practices Milton H.

yelled and cursed at my boss i work for a hospice type of program we recently got a new patient which i worked with a couple weeks ago he was rude and screamed at me and has an attack dog which already attacked one of our girls and almost got me he has no condition where his behavior should be this way i reported his behavior and told my supervisor that i refused to work with this man i have never refused to work w anyone company policy is that we are not to be spoken to in an abusive manner or our safety put in jeopardy i feel the way he spoke to me and put me down was abuse and his dog is not safe for strangers to be around he even said so i was to work with this man again sat i reminded my supervisor all wk to get someone else to do it friday i talked to her to be sure it was covered and she avoided me until the end of the day by the time i spoke to her i was very frustrated i raised my voice not screaming insanely and used a few curse words damn mostly and i think i said i was sick of of this shit anyways she threatened my job if i did not go so i called our head office and told them they said i was valid in not wanting to work with the man i went to work sat nothing was different the head office said for me to call them monday and we could work something out since i got nowhere with my supervisor should i call the supervisor and apologize and see if we can work something out or should i let it go and talk to the head office or should i suck it up and just work witht he man against my will i hate to step on toes and i wasnt trying to jumpt the chain of command the supervisor is great ive been w the company for a few yrs and never had a problem with her until now and i dont want to make her angry bc im going to school for my rn and she has always worked great w me to keep my hours and work around my classes what should i do you have worked with this company for a few years and have never complained like this before it sounds as if you have a legitimate concern for your safety i would advise to contact your supervisor and apologize only for your language and letting your emotions momentarily get the best of you tell her you have always had a great deal of respect for her and you should not have used the language however your concern is legitimate and still stands begin writing detailed documentation of the incidents with this patient do not include your opinion or how you felt simply state what transpired include any dates times etc wherever you can send this documentation to your supervisor and to hr if you are told to go again it's a predictament you can refuse based on the documentation and the fact that you have brought it to the attention of superiors if they terminate or demote you based on your refusal you need to contact an employment attorney i feel for you there's no good choice in this situation hopefully your company will find alternative arrangements you certainly can and should seek legal action if things go the other way however it will be emotional and trying good luck  Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Scientology beliefs and practices Domestic violence Plame affair Dog training Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Jam (TV series) The Marshall Mathers LP Autism Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Sin City Social rule 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Milton H.
