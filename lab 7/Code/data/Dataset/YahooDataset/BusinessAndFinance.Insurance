slip and fall accident over a year ago and my atty is just now sending a demand is this taking along time is he just wanting to go to trial to get even more money but my expenses keep going up also can i get a second laywer and they split the are you still treating or have recently finished demands are rarely made until it can be determined how much the medical bills will be and what type of ongoing injuries you will have an insurance company and or jury isn't going to pay you for a future injury if your doctor hasn't determined that you will have ongoing effects and your lawyer would be committing malpractice to attempt to settle without knowing if you will have future issues once your treatment has reached a stable point or finished the lawyer will request the medical records and bills to date this can take a couple of months to compile and prepare a demand so if it has been months since you finished treating and there still isn't a demand call and ask what the delay is attorneys don't want your case to a lawsuit in general non suit cases get them while suit cases get them however the attorney does very little work on a non suit case they send out a couple of letters they have staff compile and summarize medical records and they argue with an adjuster a couple of times it isn't worth their time going to court for an extra couple of percent as for hiring another lawyer it can get complicated your first lawyer has a lien on any settlement they might be willing to share your money with another lawyer but they aren't required to and if the delay is your only issue it isn't worth going into how to change lawyers your best bet is to call your lawyer's office a couple of times a week find out who his her paralegal is and get them on the phone if they can't explain the delay make yourself a pain in the by taking up a lot of their time the paralegal will bug the lawyer to get this case moving as for your slip and fall i have never seen a case i thought deserved any money the world is dangerous watch out this is your warning sign  Medical malpractice Insurance Plame affair Lawyer Tort reform John Edwards Attorney at Law Tom DeLay Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Divorce Karl Rove Lawsuit Appeal Prostate cancer Juris Doctor Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Ronnie Earle National Kidney Foundation Singapore Canadian and American health care systems compared Microeconomics Fair Game (Scientology) Health insurance Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Same-sex marriage in Canada Fred Phelps Theory of conduct Asbestos American Civil Liberties Union Inflation Contract Extreme Programming Rosa Parks Supply and demand Life insurance Law firm SCO-Linux controversies Non-economic damages caps Slander and libel 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 EastEnders Law & Order Katelyn Faber FairTax Unlawful combatant Tennessee State Constitution Growth hormone treatment Common criticisms of Microsoft Childbirth CPU cache Israeli settlement Barrister Pharmaceutical company Asbestos and the law Wal-Mart Purple Heart Hillary Rodham Clinton Cyprus dispute Jessica Lynch Urinary incontinence Abortion in Canada Same-sex marriage in the United States Advance fee fraud Plame affair timeline Conspiracy (TNG episode) Involuntary commitment Fathers' rights Abortion in the United States Bipolar disorder Los Angeles Clippers Negligence Hearsay Traumatic brain injury Legal research Make money fast Keynesian economics Article One of the United States Constitution First aid United States Code ROC presidential election, 2004 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Supreme Court of the United States 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Alternative medicine Mental Health Act 1983 Arguments for and against drug prohibition Discovery (law) Judith Miller (journalist)

my home was burglarized my homeowners insurance company allied said that if i file a claim my insurance premium will increase as mush as let me understand this allied will give me a check for the items taken then make me pay for the check over time isn't that like being vicimized twice why would my premium increase for using my homeowners insurance isn't that what i've been paying them for every month for the last years actually that's how it works with every insurance company these days yes i hear lots of complaints about that but then they are assigning your rates based on your risk score how likely you are to have a claim the only way they wouldn't charge you claims points which is what they're talking about when they say your insurance will go up is if they charged everyone like they were in the highest risk group why don't you ask the people who were in the path of katrina how they like those kinds of rates in other words they could just assume that you're going to turn in a lot of claims and charge you the highest possible rates all along or they can rate you based on your risk profile and then increase your premium if your risk profile changes incidentally i doubt they meant a increase a theft claim will assign you claims points and that usually translates to a increase for big claims there's no question you turn it in but this is why insurance agents recommend you take larger deductibles because it's rarely worthwhile to turn in small claims you'll likely end up paying more out in premium over the three years that you're assessed claims points than you ever got back out of the claim in the first place  Insurance Life insurance Health insurance Annuity Auto insurance Wal-Mart Home insurance Publicly funded medicine Citigroup Predatory lending Lloyd's of London Flat tax Earthquake insurance Mutual fund Mortgage Medical malpractice SCO-Linux controversies FairTax Neopets Adverse selection United Kingdom corporation tax Karl Rove Variable universal life insurance Unemployment benefit British national identity card Blackjack Warren Buffett Primerica Financial Services Betting (poker) Taxation in the United States Contract Capital accumulation Title insurance Secretar__a de Inteligencia Poker jargon Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Extreme Programming Bank Yield curve Universal life insurance Hurricane Rita Probation officer Gasoline Oil-for-Food Programme Philosophical skepticism Gun politics Tax Theory of conduct Cable television Debt ELO rating system Goodness and value theory Microeconomics Health care in the United States Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Prostate cancer Telephone numbering plan Social Security debate (United States) Mediation Unemployment Interest E-mail spam Firefighter Financial markets Property tax Model (economics) Surveillance HIPAA Cost of capital CPU cache Grand Theft Auto (game) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change George W.

what are the risks of getting advanced pay for the entire year i recently accepted an insurance job position so far i have paid around for all the insurance classes the license training etc it is a commission based outside sales position just this week i was told that pretty much i have to get advanced pay which means as soon as i make a sale i get paid the commission based on an entire year's premium the client will pay in the following months so that means if i quit in months then i'd be in debt because i'd owe the company money i see other insurance agents who are very very successful because if you stay for a long time you do get paid great but that's not my case because i'm going to leave in months should i just quit and find another job asap what the advance pay means is that as soon as you close a sale and submit the paperwork you get paid a percentage of the client's first year premiums for example if the premium for the first year is you may get depending on your commission scale you get this paid up front typically it doesn't matter if you leave the company but if your clients don't keep their policies for a minimum of months the company will come back after you to repay the commissions you have been paid they still have this ability even after you've left the company this is really not a good business to be in unless you already have a good list of insurance prospects or friends and family that will buy from you i've been in that business and i would never recommend it to anyone the insurance companies are only out for themselves the managers only job is to recruit they expect that their new hires will not make it but you'll come on board make a few sales then they could really care less what happens after that i was an agent for new york life for almost a year and i would never recommend it to anyone a couple of my clients dropped their insurance coverage after i left the company as i wasn't there to foster the relationship and my clients became orphaned clients and the company hired a collection agency to come after me for the commissions i had been paid being an insurance agent under this type of contract is a lose lose situation for the agent  Insurance Health insurance Life insurance Wal-Mart Mutual fund Annuity Bond Lloyd's of London Variable universal life insurance Debt Citigroup Unemployment Primerica Financial Services Real estate broker Short selling Mortgage Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Publicly funded medicine Investment bank Auto insurance Social Security (United States) Bank Warren Buffett Internet fraud Tax Oakland Athletics Monetary policy Title insurance Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks American International Group Security (finance) United Kingdom corporation tax Great Depression Unemployment benefit Financial analyst Outsourcing Hyperinflation Institutional fund management Taxation in the United States Deflation (economics) Corporate governance Education in the People's Republic of China Medicare (Canada) Stock Estoppel Commodity markets Predatory lending Government debt Student loan Plame affair Pharmaceutical company Graduate school Auction Management Microsoft Health care in the United States Barrister Prudential plc United States Postal Service National Football League Professor Cable television Finance Option Economy of the United States Poker jargon Blackjack Economic inequality Term life insurance Capitalism Value added tax Customer relationship management Eliot Spitzer Universal life insurance Baseball Actuary Derivative (finance) Bulk vending Great Teacher Onizuka Karl Rove Corporate finance E-mail spam Advance fee fraud Divorce FairTax PE ratio MapleStory Child support Drug test EastEnders Berkshire Hathaway Emergency Medical Services Freeters Call centre Adverse selection

pre existing conditions i was without health insurance from september until july because i didn't have continuous creditable coverage can my current health insurance deny me benefits for pre existing health issues such as high blood pressure under federal law insurance companies are required to provide coverage for pre existing conditions only if you meet hipaa guidelines with which it seems you are familiar given your description if you had longer than a day lapse in coverage between creditable plans yes the insurance company can and will deny coverage for pre existing conditions for at least months and sometimes as long as months depending on your state laws and the underwriting rules the insurance company has on file with the state assuming high blood pressure is your only pre exising condition you can expect to be rated up a little if it's well controlled with medications but they won't provide coverage for anything related to it during the waiting period you might want to check with them though some of them do still provide you with the same network discounts you'd get if it was a covered claim and some will also count the amount you pay out toward your annual deductible and maximum out of pocket for the year for instance i know anthem does this in virginia  Life insurance Insurance Health insurance Publicly funded medicine HIPAA Auto insurance Social Security (United States) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mortgage Annuity Medicare (Canada) Bond Medicare (United States) Health savings account Health care in the United States Health maintenance organization Canada Health Act Taxation in the United States Variable universal life insurance Managed care Unemployment benefit Lloyd's of London National Insurance Tax Barbara Boxer US health reform under FDR Cooperative Blackjack Financial services Credit card Canadian and American health care systems compared United States Postal Service George W.

about medicare we're turning soon and will be tossed out of our current health care plan with kaiser permanente we live in co and will be relocating east on the coast somewhere the information i have currently found is that there are hmo's that offer medical dental and vision including drug coverage for one low price from to per month depending on the company we go with my question is this what is the stuff about medicare part a b and all the other alphabet soups i'm a little testy here because i'm confused if etna offers an hmo plan for per month why must i choose between the alphabet plans i got some of the information from www medicare gov or is that simply an option if i go with a ppo or fee for service plan i went to the website you suggested and then went back to www medicare gov and i'm more confused then i was before just what is medicare in english please but what about a full medicare health care coverage is there such a thing can i get health care without signing up for medicare after i'm i'm so confused try talking to me in english i do not understand spanish government yes it is very confusing my answer is greatly simplified for ease of understanding you'll want to visit a local independent agent for details part a is hospital coverage when you use the medical services you have a deductible in then you pay of the allowable charges part a is free for most people and given to you automatically when you turn part b is doctor coverage it has a deductible in then you pay of the allowable charges part b cost in for most people is per month this is given to you automatically but you can decline the main reason to decline is you've got coverage elsewhere the agent will help guide you there but in most cases you won't want to decline part c is the medicare advantage plans there are three types hmo ppo and pffs private fee for service you must have both part a and part b to get on a plan the aetna hmo you spoke about is a medicare advantage plan you have a time period of months months prior to your th birth month your birth month and months after your birth month to sign up on a plan if you don't sign up when first eligible there are restrictions as to when you can sign up these plans are county specific so you'll need to sign up in co if you are living there when you turn after your move you'll need to sign up with a different plan on the east coast these plans pay the part a b deductibles and the for you you have co payments when you use the service these plans have more benefits than just being on original medicare because the plans can administer the plan more cost effectively than the government can you do not have to sign up for part c if you are ok with the deductibles and the of part a b part d is the prescription drug plan you must have either part a or part b to sign up with one you also have the same time period as you do with part c you do not have to sign up but there are restrictions and penalties if you don't sign up when first eligible part d has a deductible in there is also a donut hole where you don't have coverage the agent can give you more details many of the part c plans have part d included the part c plans and many of the part d stand alone plans will pay the deductible make sure that any medication you are taking is on the formulary of any plan that you get on the agent can guide you you can elect to get a medicare supplement instead of the part c medicare advantage plan the premium for these plans are higher but you don't have any co pays so these plans are better for people that are sick and use the medical services frequently you must have both part a b to get on a plan no supplement has part d so you will need a stand alone part d plan if you get on these plans  Pharmaceutical company Managed care Health care in the United States Medicare Part D Canadian and American health care systems compared Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Social Security (United States) Insurance Life insurance Taxation in the United States Student loan Medicare (Australia) Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act Medicaid Health savings account Wal-Mart Canada Health Act FairTax US health reform under FDR Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Health care in Canada HIPAA Flat tax National Health Service Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme United Kingdom corporation tax Canadian federal election, 1965 Social Security debate (United States) Food and Drug Administration George W.

my health insurace company is givng me trouble i have blue cross blue shield from ford motor company where i work i went out of the country and had to be hospitalized i ad to pay about dollars and theyre suppose to pay me that money back what should i do i am covered and its not extra i have reciepts and everything they do cover out of country hospitalization the uaw told me that if they dont pay me than theyre gonna have their lawyer handle the matter actually its not that unusual for an insurance company to cover medically necessary emergency services rendered outside the us i used to work for different large insurance company one of which actually used to be a part of bc bs then became its own separate company it was a standard part of all policies to cover services rendered outside of the country no special rider was needed and i can't believe that someone who is an agent would never have heard of such a thing perhaps they should check more closely with the companies they represent in case the question ever comes up with one of their clients this is how a person would have went about getting reimbursement from the companies i worked for get an itemized receipt and description of services rendered doctor or hospital notes etc if the documentation is in a foreign language get a translation and send it in with the records this will speed up the process for you if you send notes in a foreign language to the insurer and they need to find a translator it just makes it take that much longer for you to get your money back payment would be made for services that would have been covered for services rendered in the us according to your benefits on the contract ex if you have coverage reimbursement would be made at following whatever exclusions might be on your contract etc at the companies i worked for the nurses in medical review would take a look at the documentation translations and then forward the information to claims with authorization to pay for the service since there would be no usual customary rate for foreign doctors claims were processed at billed charges using the exchange rate in effect at the time of the service for the currency type of that country have you sent all of the documentation to bc bs i'm confident that you should be able to get the reimbursement due to you once all the documentation is submitted i'd clarify from your insurer exactly what paperwork is needed and keep copies for yourself also make sure that your name and insurance id number are clearly indicated on all of the pages in case they get separated  Publicly funded medicine Health insurance Contract Medical malpractice United States Postal Service Canada Health Act CPU cache United Kingdom corporation tax Managed care Health care in the United States Health maintenance organization Auto insurance Health savings account Plame affair Advance fee fraud Unemployment benefit Value added tax Security (finance) HIPAA Medical prescription Medicare (United States) Commodity markets Bank US health reform under FDR Estoppel Notary public Asian financial crisis Euro Appeal Patent application Open access XML Government debt Unemployment E-mail spam Canadian and American health care systems compared Tax Mortgage Hyperinflation Taxation in the United States Debt Social Security (United States) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Currency Wal-Mart Emergency Medical Services Copyright Public domain Bond Gross domestic product Pharmaceutical company Web crawler Divorce Arbitrage Variable universal life insurance National Insurance OpenDocument Information Services Procurement Library FairTax National Kidney Foundation Singapore Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bank fraud 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Involuntary commitment Medicine Lawyer Enterprise content management Timeline of the Enron scandal Probation officer Schabir Shaik Trial Cascading Style Sheets Compensation of employees GSM services HTML Intellectual property Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Lloyd's of London Deflation (economics) Outsourcing Internet fraud

how do i get health insurance just on my year old son start with your state children's health insurance program see if your income qualifies if he's got special needs be sure to note it most states will provide the state program access to special needs kids regardless of income mostly because it's pretty impossible for them to get private insurance if you don't qualify go to the guy that writes your house car insurance see if he does health insurance it should be relatively cheap for your son less than a month for hmo style benefits if that agent doesn't sell health insurance ask him for a local referral to a buddy that does buy local you do not want to get scammed over the internet and you do not want the in network emergency room to be miles away  Health insurance Managed care Insurance Health care in the United States Publicly funded medicine Wal-Mart Unemployment benefit Medicare (Canada) Social security Auto insurance Canadian and American health care systems compared Canadian and American economies compared Employee Retirement Income Security Act Medicaid Social Security (United States) National Health Service National Insurance Variable universal life insurance America Online Barbara Boxer Healthcare system Public policy German car number plates Cable television Taxation in the United States Social issues in the United States Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Medicine Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States Medicare (United States) Real estate broker Confidence trick Canada Health Act Advance fee fraud Adverse selection Podiatrist Pharmaceutical company ACORN Citigroup Centrelink Capitalism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Medical record Nurse Indianapolis 500 Berkshire Hathaway Social work Pretty Good Privacy Education in the United States Economy of the Republic of Ireland Personal finance Primerica Financial Services Credit union US health reform under Nixon Instant messaging Financial services AmeriCorps The Spy Who Loved Me RuneScape cheats Cooperative Internet fraud Paid Family Leave PHP Heather Wilson Mapua Institute of Technology Medical malpractice Broadband Internet access Legal aspects of transsexualism Education in Germany Gross domestic product Christopher Addison, 1st Viscount Addison Firefighter Warren Buffett HIPAA Utility cycling Health savings account Economy of South Africa 20th Century Fox Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Kaiser Permanente Economy of the United States Telephone numbering plan Kazaa Economy of Nigeria Food Stamp Program Preferred provider organization Contract National Weather Service Social welfare Automobile Obesity Social Security Administration Emergency Medical Services Microeconomics Fox Broadcasting Company Welfare state Target Corporation

texflex my husband said he would like to get me braces but he wants to pay for it through tex flex we live in texas but we don't know if we will be able to or not i'm looking to see if someone out there has ever used this and if you can or can't use it to pay for braces with help please i'm guessing that is how it is spelled he works for the state and maybe that would be a little more help on the situation yes you can use texflex to pay for your braces texflex is a flexible spending account for state employees your husband will have to sign up for it during the employee benefit enrollment period this should be coming up soon so be sure and check the dates now the amount of money you choose to have available for the flex account will be deducted from your husband's paycheck before taxes are deducted they will divide the flex amount by the number of paychecks per year and that will be the amount deducted each pay period make sure that you only elect the amount of money you know you will use during the coverage year as the irs rules are use it or lose it the texflex plan also uses a debit card system so this is very convenient for payment to the dental provider you don't have to pay first and submit for reimbursement anymore ultimately you are still paying for the braces but you are using before tax dollars which lowers your tax liability at the end of the year check the website below it is the texflex website  Social Security (United States) United Kingdom corporation tax Taxation in the United States Credit card Insurance Health savings account FairTax Flat tax Publicly funded medicine Payroll Life insurance Tax Microeconomics Health insurance Unemployment benefit Annuity Food Stamp Program National Insurance Student loan Auto insurance Cheque Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Child support Mortgage Wal-Mart Retirement plan Public transport Tax protester Personal finance Medicare (United States) Variable universal life insurance Bank Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Tax resistance Progressive tax Social Security debate (United States) Tax avoidance/evasion Apprenticeship Limited liability company EFTPOS Article One of the United States Constitution H-1B visa Compensation of employees Health care in the United States Medicare (Canada) Mutual fund Government debt Income trust Dividend George W.

should i consider selling insurance instead of furniture i sell furniture now but am not satisfied i was considering sellling for bankers life i already am working on comission but it is not enough money is this a wise move it really depends on you i would avoid becoming a captive agent meaning that you can only sell insurance for company i am an independent broker in oh best move i have ever made however i am built for outside sales selling furniture is retail the difference being that people come into your store looking for furniture rarely does anyone come to me looking for insurance i have to find them do not expect people to come to you to become an independent you will need to decide if you want to work for someone else an agency or yourself working for an agency is the best way to start if you want some initial financial support along with some back room support the downside of this is that the agency will keep some of our commissions working for yourself can mean more money but you will need to have some money in the bank to support yourself until you get enough commissions  Insurance Citigroup Bank Mutual fund Berkshire Hathaway Real estate broker Financial services NASDAQ Investment bank Annuity Finance Bond Stock broker Short selling Stock Microcredit Inventory Life insurance Tesco American International Group Security (finance) Construction Health insurance Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Sears Holdings Corporation Animal Crossing Economy of India HSBC Stock market Minor league baseball Bank of China (Hong Kong) Primerica Financial Services Contract Wells Fargo Federal Reserve Mortgage Temasek Holdings Variable universal life insurance Independent agencies of the United States government Money Gold as an investment Day trading Bulk vending Euro Mergers and acquisitions New Deal Predatory lending Wal-Mart Charles Ponzi Monetary policy Central bank Commodity markets Strap-on dildo J Sainsbury Financial markets Capitalism Lloyd's of London Habbo Hotel Tax UK Singles Chart Upholstery Toronto-Dominion Bank Publishing Principal Financial Group Social Security (United States) Economy of the United States Prudential plc Amazon.com United Artists Great Depression Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States Internet fraud Blackjack Cooperative Debt Target Corporation President's Choice Financial Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited Credit union Google Microeconomics Ko__ Holding Pyramid scheme Privatization Business Credit card ITV Edward Gibbon Wakefield Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company Inflation Shoppers Drug Mart Campaign finance reform National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States Taxation in the United States Derivative (finance) Irish Life and Permanent American individualist anarchism Government agencies in Sweden Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

does any place accept a payment plan for bariatric surgery i have no insurance and was wondering if any place would take payment plans i don't know but you could get a revolving line of credit from a bank that would handle it a heloc or something i must say that if you have no health insurance and are cost consious getting bariatric surgery is probably a bad idea they may quote you a price but bariatric surgery also involves a lot of follow up medical care and frequently involves after surgery health risks such as nacrotic fat that are not included in the price your price could skyrocked if you need follow up i would strongly suggest finding a job that will give you health insurance this might or might not pay for the bariatric surgery but it would proably pay for any emergency follow up care  Health insurance Obesity Insurance Medicare (Canada) Mutual fund Prostate cancer Unemployment Adjustable gastric band National Health Service Medicine Economy of the United States HIPAA Bond Wal-Mart Bank Emergency Medical Services Health care in the United States Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Canada Health Act Transsexuality Derivative (finance) Finance Citigroup General practitioner US health reform under FDR Canadian and American health care systems compared Managed care Social Security (United States) Stroke Traumatic brain injury Auto insurance Risk management Medicare (United States) Commodity markets Health savings account New Deal Gastric bypass surgery Medical malpractice Social Credit Bretton Woods system Divorce History of the United States (1918-1945) Money Stomach cancer Open access Capital accumulation Government debt Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Legal aspects of transsexualism Credit card Urinary incontinence Health care in Canada Anorexia nervosa Gold standard American Medical Association Collateralized debt obligation Breast implant Barbara Boxer Social security Medical record Social Security debate (United States) Hillary Rodham Clinton Adverse selection Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Plastic surgery Primerica Financial Services Debt Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Nuclear power phase-out Economics Gambling Public policy Prescription drug Childbirth Health care Microeconomics Everwood Pharmaceutical company Efficiency wages Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Canadian federal election, 1965 Nuclear power Colorectal cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Productive and unproductive labour The Apprentice 2 Berkshire Hathaway Estoppel Health care in the Republic of Ireland Medicaid Ovarian cancer Centrelink Personal finance Surgery Crohn's disease Shoppers Drug Mart

what's the cheapest insurance service what has the lowest price all three kinds it depends on the risk and rating factors you would want determined each company files their rates based on set criteria that is regulated by the commissioner of insurance who approves all rate changes and filings with each state depending on your criteria would depend on which company would be cheapest for you keep in mind that cheapest does not always mean the best for you many companies have comprehensive coverage and can handle all three types and give great coverage yet some have gaps when trying to provide multi policy coverage and for the best coverage you will need to split your coverage among more than one company  Auto insurance Life insurance Publicly funded medicine Health insurance NASDAQ Health care in the United States Title insurance Economy of India Bank Canada Health Act Pharmaceutical company Microeconomics Berkshire Hathaway Air traffic control HIPAA ASDA Lloyd's of London Adverse selection United States Postal Service Capitalism Gmail Tax Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Mutual fund Taxation in the United States Growth hormone treatment Strategic management Software testing Home insurance Cellular network Food and Drug Administration Gas metal arc welding Social Security (United States) Federal National Mortgage Association Nuclear power Paintball Instant-runoff voting Cable television National Insurance George W.

health insurance question i have never dealt with health insurance before sorry if my question is silly my health insurance nj horizon blue cross covers prenatal care including ultrasounds and blood work my doctor's office keeps on billing me for an ultrasound that supposed to be covered i've got the same bill about times when i call my insurance agency they say that my ultrasound is completely covered but doctor's office should use another code to fill in the claim i asked the office to change the code many times but i still do not get coverage is there anything i can do i feel like i am going in circles who can really resolve this problem doctor's office or insurance agency thank you doug sorry i was not clear before but i dealt with horizon directly too i did bring the paper that explains my responsibilities to the medical biller horizon even gave her customer number to call in order to change the code she filed claim again and it did not get covered again if your insurance company has received this claim and processed it then the charge is either covered or denied it sounds like they denied the charge due to the cpt current procedural code being either invalid or possibly not matching the diagnosis code regardless of why it was denied you should not be stuck in the middle your doctors office should be working with your insurance company to correct this you should have received an eob explanation of benefit says this is not a bill and it will say on the eob what the patient is responsible for many times your insurance company will deny the charge due to coding errors however it will say the member responsibility is zero that means the provider cannot balance bill you for this if the provider is a participating provider than it is more likely that you should not be billed contact your insurance company and demand that they do a three way call to the doctors office and get it resolved right away if the insurance company says they cannot contact the provider than ask to speak to a supervisor they have to work with you to resolve this i have been in the health insurance business for years and i deal with this all the time and it usually is a matter of the providers office rebilling to correct it whatever you do dont pay for this as long as the denial remains a coding error cpt codes are often updated yearly and many times the providers office is not aware of this and they bill with a deleted code there is no reason why your plan would not cover an ultra sound and you may just have to be more persistent in getting it taken care of good luck  Health insurance Insurance Publicly funded medicine Life insurance Extreme Programming Medical malpractice United States Postal Service Transsexuality National Health Service Medical prescription HIPAA Health care in the United States Stomach cancer Expert system Medicare (Canada) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus SCO-Linux controversies Information Technology Infrastructure Library Medical record Appeal US health reform under FDR Canadian and American health care systems compared Prostate cancer Emergency Medical Services Canada Health Act Ethics Wal-Mart National Insurance Scientology beliefs and practices Food and Drug Administration Managed care Contract Unemployment Prenatal diagnosis Health care in Canada Chiropractic Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Fathers' rights Citigroup Homeopathy Alternative medicine Speaker of the British House of Commons Classified information Plame affair Microeconomics Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Involuntary commitment Probation officer Killian documents Mental Health Act 1983 New Deal Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Education in the United States Auto insurance Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Hillary Rodham Clinton Social Security (United States) Bill Frist Barbara Boxer Linked list Call centre Domain Name System Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Pharmaceutical company U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Supernatural Air traffic control Secretar__a de Inteligencia Risk management Construction Surveillance Democracy 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Medicare (United States) Lloyd's of London Customer relationship management Internet fraud US health reform 1912-1920 Church of Christ, Scientist Traditional Chinese medicine Partial-birth abortion Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Steam (content delivery) Canadian Senate Deconstruction

do i keep old whole life insurance policies or cash them in for term my father just gave me five k insurance policies he had on me to me i'm now and married they are about year each total a year for k i would think i would need a lot more coverage and get a term policy but is there an advantage to keep the others or just cash them out worth less than k you may want to keep at least one of those policies active depending on what you decide to do overall that way you might at least have enough to cover expenses if you were to outlive the term policies you speak of however if you decide you no longer want the whole life policies depending on the value of them you probably won't want to cash them outright that's because you would have to pay taxes on whatever cash value you got out of the whole life policies there's a way around this though you can do what's known as a rollover of the funds from your whole life policy to a few different types of life insurance contracts without having to pay taxes on the cash values however you cannot roll the cash value to a term policy there's another option to keep in mind you could roll the funds to a universal policy which is in a lot of ways like a term policy on steroids basically a universal policy will build cash value for a little while but it will ultimately start to dwindle pretty quickly still you can keep your guaranteed death benefit till at least age and some of them extend as far as age effectively for the rest of any foreseeable lifespan that means you wouldn't lose the cash value of the whole life policies you wouldn't have to pay taxes on it either and if you're in good health you can still probably by quite a bit more coverage for the same price with universal policies you could even set it up so that you'd only have to keep paying for x number of years after which the policy is yours i typically set these up so that payments stop about the same age where my clients indicate they'd plan to retire don't be too hasty in cashing out those old policies until you get more info on your options  Life insurance Insurance Variable universal life insurance Annuity Pension Tax Health insurance Social Security (United States) Publicly funded medicine United Kingdom corporation tax Microeconomics Mutual fund Universal life insurance Taxation in the United States 401(k) Money Contract Bond Inflation Lloyd's of London Corporate finance Retirement plan Unemployment benefit Monetary policy Trust (Law) USA Personal finance Bank Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social security Auto insurance Education in the United States Craps Ra (board game) Deflation (economics) Poker jargon Canada Health Act Public policy United States Postal Service Social Security debate (United States) Medicare (Canada) Nuclear power phase-out Student loan Primerica Financial Services Freeters Wal-Mart Capital accumulation Lottery National Insurance Canadian and American health care systems compared Life expectancy Government debt Security (finance) Warren Buffett FairTax Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Credit card Subsidy Commodity markets Title insurance Individual Retirement Account Blackjack Home insurance Gross domestic product Individual Savings Account Inheritance tax Health savings account Hyperinflation Common Agricultural Policy Florida Lottery Economy of Russia Leasing Productive and unproductive labour Actuarial notation Finance Child support Television licence Policy Debate Economy of Africa Institutional fund management U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Arguments for and against drug prohibition Theory of conduct Great Depression Contract with America $ale of the Century Supply and demand London Congestion Charge Trust (Law) non-USA Risk management Gambling

do i need to hire a lawyer to fight against health insurance company for denied claims i am having problem with my health insurance company who denied coverage there is outstanding balance which supposed to be covered but were denied because of i am also listed under my husband's health insurance the claims were re routed to both insurances and i haven't contacted the state agency dept of insurance yet on the state agency's web site it saying if you have an attorney representing you in this matter or if there is a lawsuit currently ongoing or pending our ability to mediate this matter is limited but we will investigate your inquiry for any regulatory issues however if a lawsuit is pending we may defer the regulatory investigation until the finality of the litigation we ask that you still complete this form so we have a record of your issue the original service was rendered month ago and i am losing time shoud i file a complaints to state agency first and wait for what they are come up with or hire an attorney now well what's the time frame will they honor claims filed within days or i'd be very inclined to do the insurance department first an attorney is going to cost you money up front and they're not likely to be able to do anything for you i'd also be inclined to gather up all the paperwork including copies of both policies and truck it down to have a meeting with your homeowners insurance agent and get their opinion free of charge your policy would be primary depending on why your policy declined to cover then your husband's should be secondary covering you so the declination from the primary carrier should trigger coverage from the secondary unless we're talking about an uncovered procedure here like cosmetic surgery you need to have both claim eob's and both declination letters to send to the insurance department now they're usually pretty fast you'll likely have a response within two weeks and normally the days retriggers from the date the claim was denied so that should buy you a little more time  Insurance Life insurance Plame affair Wal-Mart United States Postal Service Medical malpractice SCO-Linux controversies Karl Rove 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Lloyd's of London Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 National Health Service Medicare (Canada) Lawsuit Terri Schiavo 2005 Philippine electoral crisis Eliot Spitzer Tort reform Downing Street memo Patent Citigroup Hillary Rodham Clinton Plame affair timeline Software patent debate E-mail spam Government of India Fair Game (Scientology) Asbestos Tom DeLay Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Probation officer HIPAA 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Michael D.

is it possible to collect social security benefits and not be enrolled in medicare at all i obviously wish to keep recieving benifits from social security but the medicare has really messed up my enrollment into tricare prime i have medicare part a but refused part b now that i want to enroll in tricare prime i have to pay a surcharge ad wait unti next year before i can enroll it was so much easier before i collected social security because i was enrolled in prime before and simply paid the quarterly premiums then when i started collecting social security i got tossed from tricare prime because i didn't know any better at the time and disenrolled in part b medicare so if i could i would rather just completely ditch medicare if i can just so i can requalify for tricare prime and not pay so much out per month can it be done thanks thanks for the answers so far i am well under and i had tricare prime first before i got ss then when i got ss they automaticially enrolled me in part b medicare then i dis enrolled to save money because i figured i didn't need that as i can go to the va hospital as well social security medicare and tricare are all government agencies for those that don't know tricare is the military health plan this is a confusing situation you said you refused part b but then said you were disenrolled from part b did you refuse it within the time limits it sounds like you didn't if you refused it in time you couldn't have been enrolled in it to become disenrolled you become automatically enrolled in part b social security and part b have no correlation it doesn't matter what health plan you have to get ss and getting ss will not affect any health plan tricare acts as a supplement to medicare you are still on medicare but you get your services from tricare you will need to contact tricare to find out what you need to do to get back on you should also contact medicare there are rules about when you can enroll in any plan so that is why you need to wait  Medicare (United States) Medicare (Canada) Social Security (United States) Taxation in the United States Health insurance Medicaid Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Medicare Part D Medicare (Australia) Health care in the United States United States Department of Health and Human Services Payroll Social Security Administration Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Health maintenance organization Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act Pharmaceutical company Politics of Canada Hillary Rodham Clinton Canadian and American health care systems compared Economy of the United States Flat tax Health care in Canada HIPAA Social Security debate (United States) Life insurance Student loan Heather Wilson Gross domestic product Insurance Government debt Chiropractic United States Code FairTax Wal-Mart H-1B visa Social issues in the United States Contract United Kingdom corporation tax Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Pitaten Canada Health Act Annuity Plame affair Ontario Liberal Party Canadian federal election, 1965 Winter of Discontent Bond Dalton McGuinty Warren Buffett National Health Service Charlottetown Accord John Howard Vivian Solon Social rule American Medical Association Nursing home Amish US health reform under FDR Canadian Senate Managed care Ocean's Twelve George W.

i had a car accident had a total loss on my car i was hit by another driver who was at fault i incurred a back injury and visited the chiropractic doctor times i had a mri massages and exercises done i feel better now the visit to the doctor cost me and the mri cost me another i had a coverage for pip for and the guy who hit me had a full coverage on his car my attorney is filing a case against each of these companies my lawyer is telling me that i dont have a valid case because i didnt sustained a permanent injury my attorney had asked with my doctor for my medical release i was also paid for my car by allstate the insurance company of the guy at fault i am a full time student and trying to complete my school on loan so i haven't worked from the day of my accident to this date so my attorney is filing for a settlement with both of the insurance companies so i am going to get any money from this i had a doctors bills for mri cost of and a for my car so how much is my case worth now i am in florida it's been a long time since i dealt with florida so adj attnys from that area may can tell you more but here goes florida is a no fault state which means they have personal injury protection coverage each driver files under their pip coverage for their medical bills up to you may also have medical payment's coverage that can help too this is regardless of whose fault the accident is hence the nick name no fault in order to collect for pain and suffering you have to break threshold having a permanent injury breaks threshold and would allow you collect from the other person's liability since your bills are less than and you do not have a permanent injury then you can not recover more but look at it this way since you were such an honest person and did not run up a bunch of un needed medical treatment nor fake a permanent injury maybe karma will be kind to you and if you ever have a wreck that is your fault you will be fortunate enough to hit someone who is honest and not some greedy bas d who is out to just rip off an insurance company and make everyones premiums go up  Insurance Life insurance Medical malpractice Health insurance Terri Schiavo Medicare (Canada) Negligence Tort reform Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Health care in the United States Liability insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Traumatic brain injury Publicly funded medicine Tax Contract Road traffic accident Microeconomics Non-economic damages caps Slander and libel Lawyer American Medical Association Risk management Variable universal life insurance Divorce Asbestos and the law Asbestos Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Driver's license Chiropractic Childbirth Taxation in the United States Attorney at Law John Edwards Law firm Appeal Bond Dave Reichert 2003 California recall 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Child support Repetitive strain injury Unemployment benefit Medical prescription Medicine John F.

why is your fico score directly related to your mortgage insurance if you have a score that gets you year fixed rate how can the insurance company judge your rate on your credit scores if you have a low score you should not get a home loan i'm guessing you meant the home insurance it has been proven that people with lower credit scores have a higher rate of claims which is what the insurance companies care about each company has developed an insurance score that they use which is similar to your credit score these scores may look at different aspects of your credit as far as i know there haven't been any studies as to why because the insurance companies don't care why many people have tried to disprove the findings the university of texas had a big study several years ago but so far nobody has been able to  Mortgage Insurance Credit score Student loan Bond Life insurance Health insurance Title insurance Citigroup Publicly funded medicine Auto insurance Primerica Financial Services Bank Medical malpractice Predatory lending Education in the United States Home insurance Microcredit Unemployment Interest Savings and loan association Government National Mortgage Association Annuity Doomsday argument Mortgage-backed security Monetary policy Consumer finance Intelligence quotient Credit rating agency FairTax Unemployment benefit Lloyd's of London Capitalism Finance Credit card Federal National Mortgage Association Variable universal life insurance Taxation in the United States Derivative (finance) Credit history Berkshire Hathaway Financial services United Kingdom corporation tax Debt Taxation in the Republic of Ireland National Certificate of Educational Achievement Handelsbanken Prostate cancer Economy of Russia Mutual fund Wal-Mart Money Urban sprawl Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Irish Life and Permanent Debt consolidation Deflation (economics) Capital accumulation Health maintenance organization Divorce ELO rating system Islamic banking Canadian and American health care systems compared Public policy Individual Savings Account National Insurance Real estate bubble Economy of Pakistan Speed limit Health care in the United States Managed care Collateralized debt obligation Homeopathy Universal life insurance Mobile home Subsidy Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Security (finance) Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Credit union Bank of America Hillary Rodham Clinton Paintball Education in the People's Republic of China Pharmaceutical company Education in Finland Normal distribution Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Certificate of deposit Alberto Gonzales Financial markets Adverse selection Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Race and intelligence Tesco Pump It Up Collateralized mortgage obligation Personal finance

what should i be looking in a health plan to cover a family of four i e hmo ffs etc i'm starting a new job and have to choose between different health insurance plans and i'm very confused i would choose a pos point of service plan if i could afford the higher premiums first if not i would choose a ppo preferred provider organization and thirdly a hmo health maintanence organization all types use networks but pos and ppos allow you to go outside the network whenever you want coverage won't be as good out of network with an hmo you must use an in network provider unless it's an emergency this means your current doctor may not be on an hmo plan and you would have to switch doctors with an hmo there is a gatekeeper meaning you have to get approval prior to having specialized care with a pos plan you need a doctor's referral and with a ppo you need no prior approval all types of health plans have copays typically and hmos have no deductibles while ppos and pos plans do this means that with an hmo only your copay will come out of pocket and witha ppo or pos you may have to satisfy a deductible and cover a portion of the charges usually if you have a major medical event this makes a good case for hmos but hmos have the highest degree of utilization review meaning the hmo will often refuse to pay for treatment that may be medically necessary hmo doctors either receive a salary or a set fee for service from the hmo as well as bonuses for keeping costs down this may lead them to recommend that you don't need treatment that you may need or you may receive substandard service in order to keep costs low hmos are all about preventative care and they try very hard to not pay for expensive treatments and surgeries ppos and pos plans have some utilization review but it is on a much smaller scale than hmos typically the best claims processing and claims approval to denial ratio is with a pos plan that's one reason why pos plans cost more  Publicly funded medicine Medicare (Canada) Insurance Preferred provider organization Life insurance Canadian and American health care systems compared National Health Service Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Health savings account Medicine Wal-Mart Microeconomics Transsexuality Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Mutual fund Medical malpractice Canada Health Act EFTPOS Obesity Mental Health Act 1983 Nurse Education in Germany Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Medicare (United States) Kaiser Permanente US health reform under FDR Education in Portugal Cable television General practitioner Telephone numbering plan Anorexia nervosa Food and Drug Administration Mortgage Physician Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Healthcare system Relationship marketing United Kingdom corporation tax Centrelink Open access Medical record Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Involuntary commitment Legal aspects of transsexualism Alternative medicine Growth hormone treatment Medical prescription TGV Social Security (United States) Medicare (Australia) Gas metal arc welding For-profit hospital People With AIDS Self-Empowerment Movement Tax Health care in Canada Stomach cancer Information Technology Infrastructure Library Divorce Natural monopoly Homeopathy Myocardial infarction X.25 Antiretroviral drug Auto insurance National Kidney Foundation Singapore Thermal power station Pharmaceutical company High-definition television Abortion Contract Emergency Medical Services Breastfeeding Virgin Mobile Graduate school Student loan Abortion in Canada FairTax Psychiatry Employee Retirement Income Security Act Medical ethics Economic inequality Podiatrist Church of Christ, Scientist Taxation in the United States

how can i find out what a medical procedure code means on a bill i have a medical bill with charges for x rays with procedure codes how do i find out what the codes mean you would either need to have access to a coding book to get the precise definition or you could plug the code into google if you just wanted to get a general idea ex plugging cpt into google then scanning the results would show you that its a code for therapeutic exercise something that's generally billed by physical therapists with an x ray the code is most likely specifying what part of the body the x ray was done on for example is an x ray of the elbow if you see a modifier attached to the code it means that the charge was for the reading of the x ray would be the charge for the taking of the wrist x ray would be the physician's fee for the reading and interpretation of that x ray  Medicine Reparative therapy Physical therapy Massage Copyleft Open access Hypnosis Abortion in Canada Transsexuality Traditional Chinese medicine Physical examination Physician Perl Psychotherapy Computer virus Emulator Appeal Ionizing radiation Cancer Compiler optimization Prostate cancer Drug abuse Computer Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Partial-birth abortion Carpal tunnel syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Scientology beliefs and practices Anthroposophy G__del's incompleteness theorem Oncology Ice hockey Weight training Addiction Milton H.

when changing auto insurance companies am i bound by law to show the new policy to the old insurance company say today is st feb' i had an auto policy from farmers that expired on st jan' today i buy a new policy from a different insurance company aaa when i discontinue service with farmers am i bound to show the new insurance policy to them also will i get charged for the period from st jan' to st jan' by farmers say today is st feb' i had an auto policy from farmers that expired on st jan' today i buy a new policy from a different insurance company aaa when i discontinue service with farmers am i bound to show the new insurance policy to them also will i get charged for the period from st jan' to st jan' by farmers editing after reading replies this is for the state of california yes i did not renew the policy because the rates were high and it took me a months time to find a new cheaper provider aaa and so i am changing the provider now after a little over a month thanks for the input guys adding a few things that might clear a few doubts i had farmers insurance from st july to st dec' i got a letter from the agent with the increased rates so my premium increased a bit for the period of st jan' to th june' so i decided to not to go with farmers and it took me a while to get a better quote i moved and switched jobs etc so i have not paid anything in advance to farmers they sent me the revised rates which i did not like and hence asked them to discontinue so the q is that if i don't pay anything to farmers if they ask me to pay any amount or if they owe me something and they refuse to return me the amount or return less amount can i take any action against them and secondly if farmers let s the dmv know about the month out of insurance coverage can the dmv take any action here's the deal if you were to have asked farmer's to cancel as of a previous date and had no replacement coverage as of that requested cancel date then farmers would have been allowed to charge you up until the date you actually requested cancelation if you had already paid the premium in advance you'd get a refund of everything but the days during which there was no replacement coverage if you has paid nothing yet to farmers you'd get a bill for the days example on feb you tell farmers to cancel you as of jan a backdated cancelation but you had no replacement coverage as of jan farmers then cancels feb and charges you for the days in between or refunds for all but those days if you had paid them in advance why is this because if you had a claim during those days farmer's would have been on the hook to pay it and if it were a big liability claim you'd want them to pay it furthermore a claim for an occurrence during that days could come in several months later a classic whiplash claim for example now if you did have replacement coverage in force as of the requested cancelation date farmers will want to see proof of it you needn't show then the actual policy a copy of the front declarations page is enough or else a copy of an evidence of insurance card will do the trick you might also be required to sign a statement saying that to the best of your knowledge there are no claims nor any circumstances that might lead to a claim during the days give 'em that and they know there was other insurance as of the date you want to cancel even if that date is in the past you'd get your premium back or if there was no premium paid and no prior balances anywhere you'd be billed nothing so chances are you'll be charged up until the date you asked for cancelation because you can't show you had other coverage for the days prior to that this is a good thing now you're out of hot water with the dmv the reason for this is that the state is very interested in coverage being there in case of an accident therefore insurance is required likewise if you cancel for any reason you are required to have replacement coverage so the insurance is continuous understandably the last thing farmers or any carrier wants is to be on the hook for a claim during a period of time when they weren't getting their premium thus they won't let go of the policy until they see evidence that something else was actually there if they don't have that the state will stick them with your claim the policy is based on a simple promise if you'll pay us a premium will pay or defend your covered losses that are reported to us unquestionably had there been a claim during the days after you wanted cancelation farmers would have had to pay likewise they're entitled to the premium for that period of time the only exception is when there is other coverage in force and quite understandably farmers wants proof of that if you do have empty days the state might discover it it takes awhile sometimes but eventaully the dmv computers will see the gap and you'll be asked to show them evidence of coverage if you can't ptovide it penalties and fines will vary according to the state you're in typically you'll pay a fine plus what the premium would have been had you been covered through the state auto insurance fund by whatever name it goes not all states check every record some do every tenth or observe another formula good luck with this ok  Health insurance Contract Plame affair Publicly funded medicine Estoppel Wal-Mart United States Postal

should i get life insurance i am going to be and i am having a beautiful baby boy in january would it be a good idea to get life insurance yes you should get life insurance you can afford so that your child will be taken care of should you die prematurely i respectfully disagree with those who say term life insurance is the only way to go term life covers you for specified amount of time or term all of the premiums that you pay for a term life policy will be gone however when the term is up you have purchased security but that is all you will never see that money again if you get a whole life policy the insurance company will invest your premiums and your policy will build cash value over the years a whole life policy will never expire as long as you continue to pay your premiums if you live years and day more you will still be covered under whole life you will not be covered under your year term policy if you live to you will still be covered at some point your cash value can be used to pay the premiums for you to keep the policy in force you can also borrow against the cash value a whole life policy is more expensive but you are young and should get a good rate the usual knock against whole life is that you could take the money you would save by getting term life and invest it into something with a better return that may be true but be realistic would you really invest the premium savings would you invest them in a sure thing whole life is guaranteed to build cash value and how exactly are you going to invest a month save up for months and buy one share of google stock to find out more go here http www lifeinsurancewiz com good luck  Insurance Variable universal life insurance Annuity Mutual fund Bond Term life insurance Warren Buffett Universal life insurance Financial markets Finance Health insurance Bank Hyperinflation Option Citigroup Social Security (United States) Debt Margin (finance) Yield curve Contract Stock Social Security debate (United States) Fixed income Predatory lending 401(k) Economy of Russia PE ratio Security (finance) Lloyd's of London Derivative (finance) Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Gross domestic product Pension Publicly funded medicine Deflation (economics) Interest Corporate finance Great Depression Individual Savings Account Money Mortgage Capital accumulation Short selling Auto insurance Primerica Financial Services Title insurance Credit card SCO-Linux controversies Inflation Berkshire Hathaway Medicare (United States) Government debt Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Modern portfolio theory Neopets FairTax Arbitrage Unemployment benefit Tax Supply-side economics Capital asset pricing model Medical malpractice Gold as an investment Mergers and acquisitions New Deal Microeconomics Federal Reserve Keynesian economics Actuary Public policy Intellectual property Institutional fund management Betting (poker) Philatelic investment Rational pricing Income trust Retirement plan Monetary policy Money supply Closed-end fund Gold standard Cost of capital Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Investment bank Charles Ponzi Flat tax Capitalism History of the United States (1918-1945) Home insurance Savings and loan association Unemployment Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus

why wasnt flood insurance standard for homeowners in new orleans katrina victims just lost their case for insurance claims seems like the lending institutions would have forced homeowners to have flood insurance on their homeowners policies in new orleans flood insurance is available but very expensive under the current system if you made it standard for basic homeowner policies fewer people would be able to afford to purchase a home personally i think this might not be a bad idea make individuals responsible for their own flood coverage instead of a government bailout let those people that live near the ocean pay the cost instead of the rest of us paying for others to have nice ocean views  Insurance Life insurance Health insurance Home insurance Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States Publicly funded medicine Political effects of Hurricane Katrina Mortgage Unemployment Microeconomics Wal-Mart Hurricane Rita Tax Medical malpractice Mutual fund Flood Earthquake insurance Predatory lending Gross domestic product Supply and demand Property tax Emergency preparedness Saskatchewan Government Insurance Social Security debate (United States) National Flood Insurance Program Democracy National Insurance Tropical cyclone FairTax Lloyd's of London Unemployment benefit Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Government debt Public policy Autonomous building Adverse selection Blackjack Inflation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Capitalism Canada Term life insurance Social Security (United States) Monetary policy Health care in the United States Medicare (Canada) US health reform under FDR Auto insurance US health reform under Clinton George W.

my company is being taken over what can i expect expect a change of management a new system of information flow new computer software etc different tasks responsibilities standards etc sometimes it will be for the better sometimes its hell sometimes its a bit of both for example you might have more work to do you get more vacation days better health care a young know it all boss a company match of k investments etc or it might be reverse an awesome new boss less work but you might get less paid vacation etc but the goal of the take over company isn't to upset the workplace they simply want to keep the gears in motion but with their way of business i mean it can't be that bad if the company was sucessful enough to buy out your company i would just beware because the bigger corporations usually play a bit more strict structured to compensate for their size but i would do as others have suggested in looking at the job market its always a good idea to have a back up plan edit also you won't be able to tell until the new management system has started you might know right off the bat for example they might take advantage of everyone and simply overwork underpay them to eliminate all the existing employees and replace them with college grads  Wal-Mart Apple Computer Investment bank Corporate governance Outsourcing Mutual fund Microsoft Unemployment Insurance Workplace democracy Blackjack Gross domestic product Electronic commerce Mach kernel Software patent debate Corporate finance Management information system Management Alex Ferguson Capitalism Boss (video games) Product Lifecycle Management Finance Health insurance Strategic management Publicly funded medicine NeXT Dilbert Working time Free trade Enterprise content management Canadian and American health care systems compared ITV Electronic Arts Corporation Life insurance IBM PC compatible Keynesian economics Rational Unified Process Education in the People's Republic of China United Kingdom corporation tax MMORPG Digital circuit SCO-Linux controversies Financial services NVIDIA Norway national football team Video game developer Anarchism and capitalism Call centre AMD Amiga Quality control Economic inequality Bond ISO 9000 Capital accumulation Wheel of Fortune Redundant array of independent disks Privatization Bretton Woods system Democracy Business process reengineering CPU design Efficiency wages Manual transmission Anarchism and society Database management system Ashton-Tate Public policy Lloyd's of London Steve Jobs Day care PLATO Sony IBM Inflation Social Security (United States) Virtual memory Stock Theory of the firm Newcastle United F.C.

auto insurance question my insurance company wrote an estimate to repair my vehicle and didn't use new parts what is the difference between 'used' and 'aftermarket' parts are they allowed to do this used parts come from a similar vehicle as yours that was already wrecked but still has good parts on it aftermarket parts are 'new' but not made by the company that made the original parts on your vehicle they are suppose to be made to the standards of the original parts aftermarket parts on things like brake pads etc are usually fine however when it comes to body parts i would prefer used this is because they usually will take a group of parts already together this will limit the number of welds needed to put the parts on as for if they can do this it is standard practice to do this for vehicles more than a couple years old  Insurance Auto insurance Vinyl roof Ford Mustang Toyota Camry Toyota Prius Health insurance Volkswagen Golf Motorcycle Rail terminology Station wagon E85 Dodge Neon Drag racing Automobile Dodge Charger Automatic number plate recognition Welding Car handling Bicycle frame Life insurance Road-rule enforcement camera Chevrolet Corvette Chevrolet Corvair engine Toyota Land Cruiser Radio controlled car Sport utility vehicle Personal rapid transit Reliability engineering Speed limit Annuity Disc brake Porsche 928 BMW De Lorean Motor Company Lamborghini Diablo Lloyd's of London Ship of Theseus Automatic transmission Auto racing NASCAR Unemployment Mini Clarinet Mazda RX-7 Nissan Skyline Variable universal life insurance Autobahn M1911 Crew Exploration Vehicle Novelty (locomotive) Crash test dummy German car number plates Coupling (railway) Solar car Screw Wayne Corporation Floppy disk Tire Locomotive Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Knight Rider Four wheel drive M16 (rifle) School bus Strap-on dildo Casting Drifting (motorsport) Contract M4 Sherman Bicycle brake systems Road traffic accident Atmospheric reentry Inertial guidance system Yugo Semi-trailer Normal distribution Audi Bicycle helmet Wal-Mart Land Rover Range Rover Security (finance) Mitsubishi Eclipse Grand Theft Auto (game) Hybrid vehicle Citigroup Mutual fund History of the automobile BMW Z1 Saskatchewan Government Insurance Arc welding Driver's license Truck Gmail Chair Warranty Progressive Corporation Microeconomics Volkswagen Beetle

what should the basic coverage be on a home insurance policy for a home valued at i'm not sure what you mean about the basic coverage are you asking how much an insurance policy should cost what kind of coverage liability amounts with that in mind i will try to give you a little information you always want to purchase a full replacement coverage policy for your home with full replacement the insurance company will pay the cost to replace items rather than give you a depreciated amount for example your roof will depreciate in value over time if you get hail damage full replacement coverage will pay the full cost of replacing the roof less deductible other policies would only pay the depreciated value which means you could be picking up half of it or more for liability limits purchase the highest liability limit you can without having to go to some type of umbrella policy often around typically the liability amounts are relatively low increasing that amount is very inexpensive i increased mine a couple years ago from k to k the cost of my insurance went up around per year with the higher liability limit you are insulating yourself against injury lawsuits many insurance companies lock the value of your home in at the time you purchase the insurance i think you get around a increase in value after that you have to notify the insurance company that your house is worth more which means you will be paying more for the insurance check with a reliable insurance agent that can shop many different insurance companies if you go to a xyz insurance agent you are going to get xyz insurance if you go to an insurance agent that can shop your rates you will get the best rate regardless of whether it is xyz or abc insurance hope this helps  Life insurance Auto insurance Microeconomics Home insurance Health insurance Wal-Mart Tax Publicly funded medicine Mortgage Annuity United Kingdom corporation tax Lloyd's of London Credit card Title insurance Risk management Surveillance Variable universal life insurance Depreciation Contract Taxation in the United States Mutual fund Gross domestic product Blackjack FairTax Medical malpractice Citigroup Mobile home Health care in the United States Liability insurance Unemployment Personal finance Inflation Capital accumulation Bulk vending Tort reform Nuclear power phase-out Term life insurance 401(k) Consumption of fixed capital Corporation Stock Poker jargon Unemployment benefit Primerica Financial Services Warranty National Insurance Warren Buffett Berkshire Hathaway United States Postal Service High-voltage direct current Nuclear power Saskatchewan Government Insurance Corporate finance Health savings account Airline Transistor Bond Money Battery electric vehicle Drug test Commodity markets Monetary policy Growth hormone treatment Economy of Russia Asbestos Asset Wind power Solar power Member of the European Parliament Intellectual property Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Taxation in the Republic of Ireland U.S. generally accepted accounting principles Capital gains tax Slander and libel Cooperative United States dollar Bank Liability Supply and demand NFL on television Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Medicare (Canada) RuneScape weapons Tri-Stat dX Autonomous building U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Property tax Labor theory of value Sport utility vehicle Federal National Mortgage Association Incorporation (business) Gramophone record Capitalism Solar cell

can an insurance company use the fact that i had an hiv test as the basis for increasing my premiums i heard through the grapevine that someone from gb was in the u s and had a mandatory hiv test my understanding is that subsequent to the test and independent of the result the test was negative his health insurance premiums went up in effect the individual believes that the fact of having had an hiv test increased his premiums e g as the test may have been a risk factor indicator to the insurance company i am wondering if it is legal in the u s to use the simple fact of having had an hiv test as the basis for risk determination and adjustment of health insurance premiums thanks for your insights there are lots of conflicting responses here shakes head in disbelief the answer is no nowadays an hiv test is considered part of a normal workup for sexually active adults a health insurer cannot raise a person's premium simply because of such an innocuous test secondly while this may be an individual policy instead of a group policy individual policies do not receive individual rate increases in other words your friend's insurer calculates premiums based on the claims losses from all insureds having the same policy that your friend does so he was not the only one whose premium increased generally premiums can only be individually increased due to a person transitioning into a higher age bracket if your friend wants to confirm the reason s why his premium increased he can file a complaint with his state's insurance commissioner's office which will investigate one final thought insurers cannot do whatever they want to do as some folks wrote above they must abide by the insurance laws of the states where they sell policies actually insurers are highly regulated  Insurance Life insurance Health insurance Contract Microeconomics HIV test Annuity Lloyd's of London HIV Medical analysis of circumcision Taxation in the United States Auto insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mutual fund Duesberg hypothesis Inflation Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Cancer Medical malpractice Prostate cancer Cable television Supply and demand Variable universal life insurance Consensual crime Intelligence quotient Keynesian economics Economics AIDS reappraisal Citigroup Methamphetamine Antiretroviral drug Hepatitis C Infantilism Legal aspects of transsexualism Unemployment benefit AIDS in Africa HIV vaccine Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Tax Human sexual behavior Biology and sexual orientation Wal-Mart Model (economics) E85 Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Capital accumulation Pharmaceutical company Medicare (Canada) Government agencies in Sweden Transsexuality Same-sex marriage AIDS pandemic Liability insurance Coeliac disease FairTax Psychology Capitalism Arguments for and against drug prohibition Corporate governance Growth hormone treatment United Kingdom corporation tax Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Anorexia nervosa Mobile phone radiation and health Social Security (United States) Herpes simplex virus Rape Drug test Ethics Abortion Estoppel Administrative law of the United States Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hypoglycemia Free trade Liberalism Health care in the United States Food and Drug Administration American International Group Expert system Hyperinflation Publicly funded medicine Drug abuse Education in the United States Borderline personality disorder United States Postal Service Probation officer

i am representing myself in car accident is it true that you can request one check for medical bills injury how your claim would get paid depends on the type of claim that you have medical payments pip liability and the laws in your state with out knowing more about your situation its hard to to answer the best thing to do is ask the adjuster that is handling your claim most people don't realize that insurance and claims is one of the most heavily regulated industries adjusters are held to fair claims practices and standards many states have laws saying what adjusters can and can't do we don't trick you into settling if the other party is at fault his insurance adjuster is going to want to settle your claim for a fair value sometimes there are disagreements on what is fair but in the end an adjuster's job is to pay claims the best thing to do is keep the lines of communication with the adjuster open if you have a question ask it if you want to double check anything the other co adjuster tells you check with your agent or adjuster at your insurance company you can even check with your states insurance department most claims do not require the assistance of an attorney i always recommend that you try to work directly with the insurance company adjuster you can always hire an attorney later if you think things are not progressing please keep in mind an attorney is going to take expenses from your settlement for his fee if he files a law suit his cut goes higher also hiring an attorney does not speed the process up it usually slows it down b c another person has been added to the equation although plaintiff attorneys like to get on tv and say that insurance adjusters are afraid of attorneys the reality is we are not i work with attorneys every day i know which attorneys in my area are smart and are good advocates for their clients i also know which ones are idiots like any job there are some adjusters that are really good at what we do and a credit to the profession and there are some that are idiots attorneys are the same way just cause he graduated law school does not mean he knows his way around a claim good luck  Insurance Tort reform Lawyer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Medical malpractice Health insurance Barrister Contract Attorney at Law Class action Slander and libel Life insurance Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Mediation Advance fee fraud Microeconomics Solicitor Paralegal Asbestos Mutual fund Credit card Software patent debate Apple Computer Health care in the United States Probation officer Wal-Mart Scientology beliefs and practices Workers' compensation Law firm Auto insurance Road traffic accident Tom DeLay Citigroup Mortgage Social Security (United States) Discovery (law) Unemployment Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Commodity markets Eliot Spitzer Fair Game (Scientology) Karl Rove Juris Doctor Speed limit United States Postal Service Tennessee State Constitution Patent application Roe v.

i need help please i'm yrs old and pregnant for the first time i have a job at ge but it's an internship because i'm in college full time since it's an internship i can't get benefits yet unless they take a chunk of money out i've applied for a medical card to pay for my appointments but they haven't sent anything telling me something yet the deadline hasn't come yet for it to be here but it's rapidly approaching i know the bills will start rolling in soon my dad just put me back on his medical insurance since i'm still a student and stuff so my question is if the medical card doesn't come in time the clinic told me to come in only if i didn't have insurance can i show them my insurance card from my dad with my name on it will they bill the insurance company without me having to pay at least until i get the medical card i hope i haven't confused anyone thanks so much in advance for your help weeks pregnant with if you are on your dad's insurance policy then they should pay although they could consider it a pre existing condition and in that case they won't pay you or your dad should call the the insurance company and find out usually insurances pay for maternity related issues so you shouldn't have a problem if you tell your doctor's office that you have insurance and give them the card they should bill it you will probably have some kind of co pay or deductible to meet before everything is paid in full some doctor's offices make you pay the deductible up front and some will just bill you after your baby is born if you qualified for a medical card it may pay for anything that you had done before the card arrived or if you get a medical card the doctor may bill your dad's insurance the primary insurance and whatever that doesn't pay for the medical card secondary insurance will pay for i suggest that you or your dad call his insurance company and explain the situation and see what you have to pay for and then find out if you are getting a medical card and if you are explain the situation to them and see what they say each state is different and each insurance policy has different requirements so your best bet would be to explain the situation to them and see what you have to do i hope i have helped in some way congrats and good luck  Health insurance Insurance Unemployment Publicly funded medicine Medicare (Canada) Contract Blackjack Health care in the United States Wal-Mart Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Friends Medical malpractice Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 National Insurance Professor Auto insurance Social Security (United States) Craps Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Medical school Draw poker Theory of conduct Abortion in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Centrelink Education in Germany Annuity US health reform under FDR Warren Buffett Medicine Barbara Boxer General practitioner Mortgage Chiropractic EastEnders Plame affair Legal aspects of transsexualism Ocean's Twelve Osteopathy 401(k) Scientology beliefs and practices Physician Gambling Karl Rove Doomsday argument Canadian and American health care systems compared Haven (TNG episode) Stud poker United Kingdom corporation tax Internet fraud Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Texas hold 'em Citigroup Emergency Medical Services Health savings account Folic acid Tax Health maintenance organization Pai gow poker 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines National Health Service Social rule Androgen insensitivity syndrome Expert system Medicare (United States) Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses National Kidney Foundation Singapore Abortion debate Roe v.

anyone know about insurance adjusting anyone in the business i would rather not hear sob stories i need to learn about the business before i invest time and money have been in residential construction over years tired of the business but need to work grandma has too big a list to stay at home i sleep with grandma have for years she is my first wife also my last her list is things that i need to do at home for free trash grass paint mini blinds i gotta get a job so i can rest some if you are looking at adjusting for a career your answer will depend on what type of adjusting you would be doing independent adjuster or a company adjusting there are a lot of similarities but also some major differences an independent adjuster usually works for a smaller company that does field investigations for a number of insurance companies who don't have field reps in the area where the independent adjuster lives works a company or staff adjuster works just for one company most staff adjuster jobs are inside jobs sitting behind a desk all day working on the pc and phone you will have better benefits working for an insurance company as a staff adjuster but you can make more money working as an independent adjuster especially if you are licensed to handle storm or catastrophe claims if you are willing to work longer hours i have worked at many large companies st farm allstate american family nationwide as a staff adjuster i did both field and inside adjusting adjusting claims is never boring but when you work at a insurance company you always get more claims than you can handle in a hr week there is no overtime for any work over the hrs you do it for free since you are a salaried employee for most independent adjusters you are paid hourly based on the billable hours worked on a file so you actually get paid for any hours you work in excess of hrs as an independent adjuster you have much more face time with insureds and claimants and that gives you a chance to provide great customer service and sometimes educate people on how insurance works other times it means you get called dirty names i've done both types of adjusting and currently work as an independent adjuster even though the benefits are less than i got at big insurance companies i still like being an independent better major insurance companies expect you to work to hrs per week with no overtime if i work more than hrs i get paid for it i just get my regular hourly pay but at least i'm not working for some clueless dickweed for free to be an independent adjuster in most states you have to pass a licensing test if you work at an insurance company you normally don't have to be licensed if you want to get into this as a career i would suggest one of these backgrounds or experience auto body repair home or commercial contruction attend an adjusters training program at a vo tech school some people think that ex cops make good adjusters but i disagree i have worked with of them over the years and they were not good at adjusting being an adjuster can be a good job or it can be a bad job so much depends on where you work every claims dept at a large insurance company has tons of politics and back stabbing crap going on working for or owning an independent adjusting company lessens that crap by about good luck  Insurance Wal-Mart Health insurance Life insurance Constitution

in laymans terms what is the difference between term and whole life insurance and which one do i want term insurance is cheaper all you get is the life insurance when what ever term is up you have not accrued any cash value main two options besides shopping around for the best price is staying insured for the same amount at an increasing premium rate or maintaining your same premium for decreasing insurance coverage it is the simplest least gimmicky policy much like car insurance it pays it's value when you die while covered by the policy many policies guarantee that it it is renewable life and whole life insurance is more expensive and a part of your premium is put into a savings account so that you gain cash value that you can borrow against or that can be fully paid to the extent of the value of the insurance without having to pay further premiums in my layman's opinion term life is simpler and cheaper there are a lot better investment strategies than investing in life insurance and buying double indemnity for accidental death is money thrown away  Insurance Annuity Variable universal life insurance Term life insurance Bond Health insurance Universal life insurance Mutual fund Auto insurance Finance Mortgage Microeconomics Lloyd's of London Wal-Mart Inflation Publicly funded medicine Personal finance Title insurance FairTax Financial markets Bank Citigroup Warren Buffett United Kingdom corporation tax Option Primerica Financial Services Unemployment benefit Interest Deflation (economics) Tax Contract Health savings account Social Security debate (United States) Taxation in the United States Derivative (finance) Pension Corporate finance Canadian and American health care systems compared Rational pricing Margin (finance) Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Government debt Tariff Cost of capital Yield curve Arbitrage Economy of India Health care in the United States Student loan PE ratio Money Home insurance Supply-side economics Bulk vending Medical malpractice Stock Debt Gross domestic product Berkshire Hathaway Celtic Tiger Argentine Currency Board Medicare (Canada) Blackjack Nuclear power Monetary policy Short selling Security (finance) Medicare (United States) Privatization Gambling Keynesian economics Price discrimination Capitalism American International Group Economy of the Republic of Ireland Individual Savings Account Credit card Adverse selection Fixed income Poker jargon Gold standard Stock market Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Commodity markets Reserve Bank of New Zealand Mergers and acquisitions Political economy Model (economics) Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Personal rapid transit

how can i go about cashing an insurance check with two other parties one signed the other mia on the check this can get complicated you must first of all make some effort to locate the mia if that fails you may attempt to prevail on the insurance company to issue the check just to the two of you but don't be surprised if that runs into a dead end the other option is to have the policy if it is still in force endorsed to change the name of the insured to take off the mia name and then ask for another check if not ion force get it reinstated and then endorse off the mia somewhere along the line a surety bond may be required which basically says that you and the other payee agree to make up the difference if the mia shows up start with the agent who issued the policy and work your way from there  Life insurance Insurance Title insurance Contract Bond Annuity Lloyd's of London Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Blackjack Health insurance Variable universal life insurance Unemployment benefit Bank Universal life insurance Mutual fund Surety bond Algerian Civil War Democratic Party (United States) Schengen treaty Foreign policy of Japan Security (finance) Monetary policy Trust (Law) USA 2003 California recall Predatory lending CPU cache Financial markets Kyoto Protocol Microeconomics Nuclear proliferation Money creation Paul Hackett Bail bondsman Inflation Citigroup Social Security debate (United States) Open access Nuclear option (filibuster) Cyprus dispute Primerica Financial Services Yield curve Charles I of England ACORN U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Stock Politics of Russia Jean Schmidt Separation of church and state Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Wal-Mart Eliot Spitzer Labour economics Liberalism Year 2000 problem Vietnam War Poker jargon Mortgage Commodity markets Euro Democracy Model (economics) Oakland Athletics Betting (poker) Corporate finance Centre Party (Germany) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Esperanto grammar Finance Flat tax Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Japan-United States relations Harry Bridges Internet fraud Abortion in the United States Presidential system German car number plates Fianna F__il John Kerry presidential campaign, 2004 Government debt Bob McEwen Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Money Social Security (United States) US health reform under FDR Bob Rae Money supply Jimmy Carter E-mail spam Intelligent design Tom DeLay Corporate governance Evel Knievel Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change The Amazing Race Bill Bradley US health reform 1912-1920 FairTax Read my lips: no new taxes

how likely is it that my car insurance will go up due to this haven't had a claim in over ten years haven't gotten a ticket in probably years but the neighbor kid did k worth of damage to my car with his bike in three separate incidents basically half of it will have to be repainted i'd really really rather not go to court his insurance is not an option in this case he doesn't have laying around if i go the much easier route of getting him to pay at least my deductible how likely is state farm to raise my rates with a after deductible claim of about or so any relevant advice comment is appreciated killing the kid did cross my mind for just the briefest of moments but then i realized that might be overreacting just a tad lol forgot to mention that i did file a police report and the stepdad admitted his kid years old most likely did it again just wondering if my rates will go up if i go the easy way and file a claim insurance doesn't apply due to it being on rental property interesting question the company i work for has been discussing what a chargeable accident is for the past months the jury is still out if you file a claim with no accompanying police report showing the accident is not your fault they will consider it a chargeable accident if it wasn't why did they pay a claim i'm going to guess state farm in you state has accident forgiveness most preferred companies will not raise your rates if you have chargeable incident in say a three year period if you have then they'll raise your rates so if you'd like to file a claim and not have it count against you i'd contact the police to file a accident report against the kid turn this in with your claim and get the repair done your insurer may go after the parents for money but i'm guessing for they won't bother good luck  United Kingdom corporation tax Life insurance Insurance Flat tax Microeconomics Annuity 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Plame affair Speed limit The Amazing Race Slander and libel Capital gains tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sharon Tate EastEnders Blackjack Theory of conduct Social Security (United States) Warren Buffett Evan Mecham Child support Drug test Katelyn Faber Roswell UFO incident Road traffic accident United Airlines Tax Medical malpractice Health insurance Public domain Progressive tax Wal-Mart Attorney at Law Income tax SCO-Linux controversies Law of value Inflation Schapelle Corby FairTax Unemployment benefit Accident Estoppel Downing Street memo 401(k) Contract Milton H.

i had a small kitchen fire better to claim it on insurance or pay for damages myself i had a small kitchen fire my fault totally i left a pot on a burner that was turned on and then went to work ugh not any structural damage to home but kitchen will have to be replaced and lots of smoke damage throughout entire house i've seen questions from other folks that seem to indicate once they make a fire claim their carriers drop them i'm insured through nationwide and they have trouble getting subsequent homes insured i really can't afford to repair the damages myself it will probably take me months to pay for all the necessary repairs myself piecemeal does anyone in maryland have any experience good or bad with regard to similar claims filed through nationwide file the claim it is what you pay your insurance for if it were for i would say suck it up and move on but this is serious damage and you are going to come out ahead in the long run trust me you may have to change carriers at renewal if they jack up your rates it will depend on how long you have been a customer and your prior claims experience versus their company's policy on the reprocussions regardless smoke damage seeps deep into the walls and fabrics of everything and you need a professional company to come in and clean up you can get by sleeping on a couch for awhile but you cannot get by with a partial kitchen for an entire year you deserve to be compensated for what you have been insuring yourself for accidents like these no matter how stupid it was you have already paid for it with your premiums over the years your premiums will go up the next three years until the claim drops off no matter what company you are with but nationwide may not penalize you if you have been with them for a few years do your research for companies such as allstate and farmers insurance that do not penalize their loyal customers for one claim every x number of years the cheapest rates aren't always the best companies to place your trust in and unfortunately claims are normally the way most people find this out if they don't have an insurance agent they meet with to discuss their needs  Insurance Life insurance Health insurance Kitchen Auto insurance Lloyd's of London Plame affair Contract Medical malpractice Mutual fund Sears Holdings Corporation Unemployment Wal-Mart Variable universal life insurance Publicly funded medicine Cable television Best Buy Berkshire Hathaway United States Postal Service SCO-Linux controversies Workers' compensation Liability insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Home insurance Daylight saving time Theory of conduct Health care in the United States Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Nuclear power phase-out Medicare (Canada) Social rule Title insurance Tort reform Adverse selection Annuity Poker jargon Microeconomics Blackjack Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Delta Air Lines Citigroup Doomsday argument Patent ACORN United Airlines Warren Buffett Trust (Law) USA 2005 trial of Michael Jackson New York City Unemployment benefit Air New Zealand Corporate governance USS Tunny (SS-282) Amtrak Public domain M16 (rifle) Asbestos Eliot Spitzer Slander and libel Hyperinflation Seismic retrofit Taxation in the United States Causality Bond Primerica Financial Services Solar cell Outsourcing Credit card Evan Mecham Saskatchewan Government Insurance Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company Total Annihilation Flat tax Pretty Good Privacy Jos__ Luis Rodr__guez Zapatero Beavis and Butt-head One Piece minor characters Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited Giffen good U.S. Democratic Party presidential nomination, 2004 Major League Baseball television contracts National Football League Earthquake insurance Model (economics) Fire fighting GunZ The Duel Stove Telephone numbering plan Debt Strategic management American International Group Wall Street Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act Hendrick Motorsports

did my new dentist shorten my appt because i am an hmo patient i have a dental hmo plan and had to pick a new dentist in the network i picked a new practice in my town i went in for my first appt today for a checkup and cleaning i was in and out of that seat in less than minutes that is crazy he zipped through the scraping and the cleaning and left the room and the hygenist took the xrays and i was dismissed no one asked me anything about my teeth like do i floss how do i brush how often etc etc no one told me wether my xrays were good or not i am so upset now because i do know that hmo patients are sometimes discriminated against but i never thought it would happen to me i am still in complete shock about this experience what should i do i think i have already made up my mind about chaning dentists but i am furious should i call and ask the receptionist how long an exam and cleaning takes and what happens during one should i write a letter and tell them how i feel over the past years or so i've seen a lot of different dentists trying to find one i like what i've discovered is that most dentists especially on the first appointment take for freakin ever they want to talk about your dental history take x rays etc i'm not exaggerating when i say i've been in the office more than an hour on more than one occasion and no it's not like i have bad teeth the dentists are just very thorough especially when they have not treated you before i do believe this guy rushed you through but i won't say it was definitely because you are in an hmo maybe he's just a shoddy dentist anyway call the office act like you're a new patient and want to schedule an appointment tell them you'd like to come on your lunch hour so how long does a first appointment typically take after you get an answer if you're still not satisfied i'd contact your hmo i'd also write a letter to the dentist and copy the hmo nothing will come of it most likely but you'll feel better in doing so  Dentistry The Dentist Oral hygiene Tooth Health maintenance organization Dental brace Social rule Dental floss Dental caries My Family (television) Medical prescription Health insurance Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story The Apprentice 2 Gingivitis Sydney Riot of 1879 Boom Town (Doctor Who) Kurt Angle American and British English differences Dental hygienist Crown (dentistry) Triage The Shining (film) Dentures Vernon Schillinger Pitaten Stomach cancer Surgery Episodes of Lost (Season 2) God Emperor of Dune Orthodontics Doctorate Episodes of Lost (Season 1) General practitioner Kodocha Le Malade imaginaire Pok__mon Live!

what is a letter of creditable coverage and why does every insurance company want one before they cover you what's the deal with these things anyway the letter of creditable coverage lets the new insurance company know if you have had recent insurance coverage and it comes from your past insurance company the main reason they want one is because of pre existing conditions if you've had insurance you've probably been treated for those conditions and are in better health your new insurance will then waive much if not all of the waiting period for coverage of those conditions if you've not had coverage that means the insurance companies are taking a bigger chance on you because your medical history is unknown they will then impose the full waiting period for any condition you had prior to the effective date of the policy  Life insurance Insurance Health insurance Contract Canada Health Act Auto insurance Publicly funded medicine Medicare (Canada) Health care in the United States Mortgage Legal aspects of transsexualism United Kingdom corporation tax Pharmaceutical company Medical malpractice Canadian and American health care systems compared Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus HIPAA Title insurance Social Security (United States) Berkshire Hathaway Medicine Medicare (United States) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Unemployment Actuary Wal-Mart Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation US health reform 1912-1920 US health reform under FDR Homeopathy National Insurance US health reform under Truman Phimosis Bank Prostate cancer Citigroup Financial services Lloyd's of London Unemployment benefit Nuclear power phase-out Scientology beliefs and practices Commodity markets Annuity Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Blackjack Liability insurance Abortion Social security US health reform under Carter Downing Street memo Infertility Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Infantilism General Electric Medicaid Adverse selection Health savings account Vicente Fox Certificate of deposit Visa (document) Childbirth Slander and libel Speed limit Taxation in the United States Air ambulance Hereditary peer Health maintenance organization Doomsday argument Home insurance Copyright ITV National Health Service Credit score Economy of the Republic of Ireland Same-sex marriage Trade union Term life insurance Global warming Barbara Boxer Influenza Hillary Rodham Clinton Bipolar disorder Public policy American Express Risk management Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited Poker jargon Workers' compensation Medical prescription Growth hormone treatment Credit card Bosniaks Intellectual property Transsexuality Fair Game (Scientology) Capital accumulation Divorce National identification number United States embargo against Cuba

i want to cancel my whole life insurance policy i've had it for yrs will i get any money out of it i want to cancel simply because i've found better coverage at a lower cost elsewhere i want to know if i should expect any money from my investment usually a whole life policy will show a table of the cash value it accrues over time unfortunately three years is usually when you start to see anything since it has been three years since you took out the first policy i'd suggest using the resources at www life fdn org to determine how much insurance you really need this is an independent site put out by the insurance industry and not one company trying to steer you toward a particular product since you are used to spending more for the whole life i suggest setting the difference aside in some kind of investment account your local edward jones agent can show you options that will grow at a much faster rate than a whole life policy and give you the flexibility to access the funds without jeopardizing your insurance benefit value  Life insurance Insurance Annuity Variable universal life insurance Bond Inflation Mutual fund Citigroup Pension Term life insurance Social Security (United States) Health insurance Economy of India Universal life insurance Finance Social Security debate (United States) Corporate finance Economy of Russia Financial services Primerica Financial Services Microeconomics Publicly funded medicine 401(k) Monetary policy Deflation (economics) Capital accumulation Economy of Belgium Warren Buffett Government debt Interest Wal-Mart Unemployment Gross domestic product Free trade Debt Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Political economy Nuclear power phase-out FairTax Reaganomics Lloyd's of London Model (economics) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Financial markets Economic inequality Institutional fund management Derivative (finance) Individual Savings Account Economy of Norway Contract Blackjack Bretton Woods system Yield curve Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Stock Federal Reserve Taxation in the United States Common Agricultural Policy Economy of South Africa Title insurance PE ratio Actuary Health savings account Open access Say's law US health reform under FDR Microcredit Outsourcing Medicare (Canada) Economic relations of Japan Privatization Economy of Pakistan Asset National Kidney Foundation Singapore Argentine Currency Board Certificate of deposit Euro Auto insurance Gold as an investment American International Group Economy of Chile Social issues in the United States Retirement plan Economy of the Philippines Deficit spending Surplus value CPU cache United Kingdom corporation tax Health care in the United States Labour economics Ponzi scheme Toronto-Dominion Bank

i have an auto insurance policy for the person who hit my property how do i find which company issued it the police report shows an insurance policy number but it does not state the name of the issuing company the person ran into my brick and iron fence with his car and i want to file a claim against his insurance not my homeowner's policy the police apparently do not record this information annoying is there a numerical format of some kind that easily identify's which company issued the insurance nope occasionally an agent will recognize a policy number but there are thousands of companies out there writing policies and not all agents write for all companies plus it's private information you have two choices realistically either go through your homeowners carrier and let them chase down the policy number which btw might be inactive if the policy has been cancelled or file against the guy directly in small claims court you could also just wait and see if he files a claim with his insurer but that's not particularly proactive  Insurance Life insurance Contract Lloyd's of London SCO-Linux controversies Surveillance United States Postal Service John F.

health insurance for poor people in the usa is there any health insurance available for people who cannot afford to spend at least month yes there is but it depends upon your age height weight your current health if you smoke what type of plan and deductible you have and many other factors if you visit a local independent agent you'll be able to compare many different plans in one place the agent can find the best plan for your situation and budget do not try to do this over the internet it'll take you several days to intelligently compare all the plans available also if you have any pre existing conditions that might add a rider to the policy or cause you to be declined or if you are out of the height and weight guidelines you won't know until you've applied and gone through the underwriting process you may get answers here concerning medical discount cards be very wary of these cards they are not regulated by the department of insurance nor do the people that sell them need to be licensed this means you have little recourse when you have problems with the plan if you are tempted by the low price and claims of save up to be aware that very few doctors actually take these cards it does you little good if you have to drive hours to find a doctor that will accept the card montana couldn t find any doctors in the whole state that actually took the card and only one dentist who was on probation for unlawful activities so they banned the sale of the card and fined the company see this link http www insurancejournal com news west htm for more information many other states are starting to ban these cards as well before signing up with any discount plan get a list of doctors if they won t give you a list consider it to be a scam call the doctors on the list to make sure they re still taking the card many don t even know that they re listed as a provider and that they re accepting new patients  Health insurance Publicly funded medicine Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Medicare (Canada) Wal-Mart Pharmaceutical company Auto insurance Microeconomics Octopus card Credit card Mortgage Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bank Health care in the United States Contract Bond George W.

why is not considered discrimination when health insurance companies exclude coverage for pregnant women my concern is about insurance for women who are planning on becoming pregnant as well as if they already are pregnant this is a great question because it addresses what insurance is really about insurance is designed to help people avoid the risks of medical expenses not the certainties of something that is in progress if you take a large group of people who do not have a medical condition statistically you know that a few of them will get that condition you can price a your policies to be affordable by dividing the costs of treating the condition among the whole group in the average pregnancy cost over unless it was a cesarian that cost over if i was pregnant and i wanted you to pay for the delivery in six months how much would you have to charge me each month in order to break even it's simply not affordable i just compared a few matirnity riders for customer and i found that golden rules policies would save her to on the child she was planning to have in two years the extra cost of the insurance was worth it  Insurance Health insurance Pregnancy Auto insurance Abortion Medicare (Canada) Growth hormone treatment Canadian and American health care systems compared Legal aspects of transsexualism Contract Pharmaceutical company Mutual fund Health care in the United States Infertility Title insurance Canada Health Act Psoriasis Variable universal life insurance Medical malpractice Folic acid Food and Drug Administration Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Nuclear power phase-out Medicine Unemployment Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Social Security (United States) Predatory lending Mortgage Breastfeeding Turner syndrome US health reform under Clinton Childbirth Roe v.
